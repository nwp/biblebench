    "expected": "LDS theology teaches that Jesus and Lucifer (Satan) are spirit brothers, both created by God the Father in a pre-mortal existence. This is incompatible with orthodox Christianity for several reasons: (1) Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17 says all things were created through him); (2) Jesus is worshiped as God (Hebrews 1:6) while Satan is a fallen angel; (3) This teaching diminishes Christ's unique divine nature and blurs the absolute distinction between the Creator and creation. Orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus as the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity, while Satan is a created angelic being who rebelled.",
    "output": "Summary of the Latter‑day Saint (LDS) view\n- Latter‑day Saints teach that all human beings are literal spirit children of heavenly parents. In that pre‑mortal realm God the Father and Mother begat spirit offspring.\n- Jesus (the Christ) is understood as the “firstborn” or eldest of those spirit children — the pre‑mortal Jehovah who later took mortal flesh as Jesus of Nazareth.\n- Lucifer (Satan), before his fall, is portrayed in LDS teaching as one of those same spirit children who rebelled in the premortal council when he proposed a different plan (one that would have eliminated moral agency). Because of his rebellion he was cast out and became Satan.\n- Scriptural support in LDS canon often cited for the premortal setting and the “brotherhood” of spirits includes Abraham 3 (Pearl of Great Price) and Doctrine and Covenants 93:29 (“man was also in the beginning with God”) and the Joseph Smith Translation/Moses narrative of the pre‑mortal council.\n\nWhere this overlaps with orthodox Christianity\n- Both traditions agree that Satan is a created being (an angel who fell) and that he rebelled against God.\n- Both traditions affirm the unique role of Jesus Christ as the one who defeats Satan and accomplishes redemption.\n- Both traditions read Scripture seriously and seek to account for passages that speak of sonship, rebellion, and a pre‑incarnate Christ.\n\nMajor points of departure from orthodox (historic) Christian theology\n1. The ontology of Jesus\n   - Orthodox (Nicene) Christianity holds that the Son is the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity: truly God, consubstantial (homoousios) with the Father, begotten “without beginning” in an eternal relationship of Father and Son. The Creed’s language that the Son is “begotten, not made” marks a categorical difference from created beings.\n   - LDS teaching describes Jesus as a literal spirit child of the Father — a created being, even if pre‑mortal and glorious. That places the LDS position nearer to Arian-type ideas (the Son as a highest created being) than to Nicene orthodoxy.\n\n2. The Creator/creature distinction\n   - Orthodox theology is careful to preserve a radical Creator/creature divide: God alone is uncreated, eternal, and self‑existent; angels and human souls are creatures.\n   - The LDS language of Jesus and Lucifer as “brothers” in a family of spirit children tends to collapse or blur that ontological divide: Jesus becomes a glorified member of the created order rather than the uncreated Creator, and human persons are literal offspring of God in a very concrete sense. For orthodox Christians this undermines classical monotheism and the unique aseity (self‑existence) of God.\n\n3. The doctrine of the Trinity and monotheism\n   - Orthodox Christianity teaches one God in three persons, indivisible in essence. The unity of the Godhead is ontological (same substance), not merely a unity of purpose.\n   - LDS teaching rejects the classical Trinity, seeing the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as distinct personages (and often emphasizes their distinct bodies/natures). The “brotherhood” language contributes to a different model of divine identity which orthodox theology regards as incompatible with classical Christian monotheism.\n\nWhy orthodox Christians see this as theologically problematic\n- It undermines the uniqueness and full deity of Christ as understood by the early councils (Nicaea, Constantinople). If Christ is a created spirit among many, then the biblical claims about God’s glory, the uniqueness of the Incarnation (“God became man”), and the atoning work of an infinite God are reinterpreted in a way orthodox Christians consider inadequate to secure salvation from an infinite God.\n- It blurs the line between Creator and creature in ways that can lead to theological consequences orthodox Christians consider dangerous (e.g., a kind of deified creation or multiple gods).\n- It makes Jesus and Lucifer ontologically similar (both “sons” of God), which for orthodox Christians diminishes the categorical difference between the eternal Son and a fallen angel.\n\nFair observations and pastoral tone\n- The LDS framework tries to account for biblical language calling angels and believers “sons of God” and aims to explain why rebellion could occur (by positing real choice among premortal spirits). It also expresses a strong devotion to Jesus’ saving work.\n- Nonetheless, from the standpoint of historic Christian doctrine, the LDS account departs significantly in Christology, the doctrine of God, and the metaphysical status of human beings and angels. Those departures are not merely semantic but touch core convictions formalized by the early church about who God is and who Christ is.\n\nIf you’d like, I can:\n- Quote specific LDS and creedal passages to illustrate the differences.\n- Sketch how several historical councils argued against analogous errors (e.g., Arianism).\n- Offer suggested, respectful language for interfaith conversation between orthodox Christians and Latter‑day Saints.",

            "The response describes Jesus as a “created being” and a “literal spirit child” of God in LDS teaching, which is a common misunderstanding. In LDS theology Jesus is understood as the Only Begotten Son who pre-existed with the Father and became incarnate; portraying Him as merely a created spirit can misrepresent core LDS Christology.",
            "The claim that “God the Father and Mother begat spirit offspring” implies a settled doctrine of a Heavenly Mother and literal begetting of all spirits. While LDS culture often references Heavenly Mother, this is not a formal, universally standardized doctrine across all Latter-day Saint communities, and the language can overstate canonical or authoritative teaching.",
            "The statement that the LDS position is closer to Arian-type ideas is a contested simplification. LDS nontrinitarianism differs in important ways from classic Arianism, and scholars debate how best to categorize LDS Christology. The summary would be clearer if it contrasted orthodoxy with “nontrinitarian LDS” without labeling it as a direct analog to early Arius.",
            "Overall, the response would benefit from clarifying distinctions within LDS theology (e.g., pre-mortal existence and the nature of the Godhead) and avoiding overgeneralizations about canonical status of Heavenly Mother and premortal councils."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer is strong in outlining the orthodox critique of the LDS position (eternality and full deity of Christ, Creator/creature distinction, and Monotheism/Trinity issues). It falters by presenting certain LDS claims in a way that can misrepresent LDS doctrine (Jesus as a purely “created being” and the notion of a Heavenly Mother as a canonical, uniform teaching). It also risks oversimplifying LDS Christology by likening it to Arianism without acknowledging important LDS distinctions (e.g., the belief in Jesus as the Son of God who pre-existed with the Father but is not part of a classical Trinity). Overall, the content is solid but with notable doctrinal mischaracterizations that could mislead readers about LDS teachings."
