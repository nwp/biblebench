Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "# Baptismal Formulas in Scripture: An Analysis of the Oneness Pentecostal Teaching\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe question of the valid formula for Christian baptism represents one of the more significant theological disputes between Oneness Pentecostalism and historic, orthodox Christianity. While this issue may appear on the surface to be merely about terminology, it actually touches upon deeper questions regarding the nature of the Trinity, the authority of Scripture, and the relationship between the commands of Christ and the practices of the early apostolic church. Understanding this debate requires careful examination of both the biblical texts and the historical development of Christian practice.\n\n## The Oneness Pentecostal Position\n\nOneness Pentecostals, also known as Jesus' Name Pentecostals or modalistic Pentecostals, hold that valid baptism must be performed exclusively \"in the name of Jesus Christ\" or \"in the name of Jesus.\" They argue that the traditional Trinitarian formula found in Matthew 28:19—\"baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\"—was not the actual formula the apostles used in practice. Instead, they contend that the apostles uniformly administered baptism using only the name of Jesus, as recorded throughout the Book of Acts.\n\nThis theological position is grounded in their broader modalistic Christology, which holds that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not distinct persons within the Godhead but rather different modes or manifestations of the one God. From this perspective, referring to \"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\" as three distinct persons is considered unscriptural and even heretical. Therefore, baptism properly reflects this unity by being performed solely in the name of Jesus, who is understood to be the one God incarnate in his mode as the Son.\n\nOneness Pentecostals typically cite several texts from Acts as definitive evidence: Peter's instruction in Acts 2:38 to be baptized \"in the name of Jesus Christ,\" the Samaritan converts in Acts 8:16 who were baptized \"in the name of the Lord Jesus,\" Cornelius's household in Acts 10:48 baptized \"in the name of Jesus Christ,\" and the Ephesian disciples in Acts 19:5 who were baptized \"in the name of the Lord Jesus.\" They argue that these passages demonstrate the authentic apostolic practice that should supersede or correct what they view as the ostensibly Trinitarian language of Matthew 28:19.\n\n## The Traditional Christian Position\n\nHistoric Christianity, encompassing Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions, has unanimously held that the Trinitarian baptismal formula represents the authoritative command of Christ and the normative practice of the apostolic church. This position maintains that there is no contradiction between Jesus' command in Matthew 28:19 and the baptisms recorded in Acts, because the name of Jesus, as the incarnate Son, inherently encompasses and reveals the Father and the Spirit.\n\nThe traditional position recognizes that the biblical text, when read carefully and comprehensively, does not present the Acts passages as replacing or contradicting Matthew 28:19. Rather, these accounts describe the same reality—the act of baptizing believers into a relationship with the triune God—by focusing on the name of Jesus as the means through which that relationship is established. The Greek preposition \"eis\" used in Acts 2:38 (\"into the name of Jesus Christ\") indicates identification with and entrance into the sphere of relationship governed by that name, not necessarily a exclusive verbal formula.\n\nOrthodox Christianity further notes that the early church fathers, writing within the first few centuries after the apostolic era, universally attest to the use of the Trinitarian formula in baptism. Writers such as Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Hippolytus, and others describe baptism being administered \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\" This unanimous testimony across diverse geographical locations and theological traditions provides strong evidence that the Trinitarian formula represents the authentic apostolic practice handed down through succession.\n\n## Biblical Analysis\n\nA thorough examination of the relevant Scriptures reveals several important considerations that bear upon this debate.\n\n### The Command of Christ in Matthew 28:19\n\nThe risen Christ's commission to his disciples in Matthew 28:19 stands as the foundational text for Christian baptism. This passage records Jesus explicitly commanding his apostles to baptize \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\" This verse is notable for its triadic structure, which has been recognized throughout Christian history as an essential expression of the nature of the one God who reveals himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nThe word \"name\" (Greek: onoma) in this context is significant. In Semitic thought, a name represented not merely an identifier but the essence, character, and authority of the person. When Jesus commands baptism \"in the name\" of the Trinity, he is directing his followers to baptize believers into a relationship with and submission to the triune God in his entire being and authority. This is not a mere formula to be mechanically recited but a profound declaration of the identity of the God into whose covenant people are being incorporated.\n\n### The Acts Narratives\n\nThe Book of Acts records several instances of baptism that use the phrase \"in the name of Jesus\" or \"in the name of the Lord Jesus.\" Oneness Pentecostals argue these texts demonstrate that the apostles did not use the Trinitarian formula, thereby establishing an alternative pattern that should be followed.\n\nHowever, this interpretation overlooks several crucial factors. First, Luke, the author of Acts, never presents these baptisms as correcting or supplementing a deficient command from Jesus. The narrative flow suggests that the apostles understood their baptisms as fulfilling the commission they had received, not as innovations or corrections to it. Second, the phrase \"in the name of\" in first-century Jewish and early Christian usage did not necessarily function as a magical incantation or exclusive verbal formula. Rather, it signified entering into a relationship with, coming under the authority of, or being identified with the person whose name was invoked.\n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, when the biblical texts are read together, they present a unified picture. The name of Jesus is the name through which the triune God is made known and through which salvation is accomplished. To be baptized into the name of Jesus is to be baptized into the name of the Father who sent him, the Son who came, and the Spirit who empowers—all of whom are revealed in and through the person and work of Jesus Christ. The evangelicals in Acts were not contradicting Matthew 28:19 but rather applying it by focusing on the name that encapsulates the entire Trinitarian reality.\n\n### The Relationship Between the Texts\n\nThe biblical data does not support a contradiction between Matthew 28:19 and the Acts passages. Rather, these texts are complementary. Matthew 28:19 provides the explicit command and theological framework—the triune nature of the God into whose name believers are baptized. The Acts narratives demonstrate the application of this command in various historical situations, always with the emphasis that this baptism is accomplished through and in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nEarly Christian writers understood this relationship well. They saw no conflict between using the Trinitarian formula and recognizing that salvation comes exclusively through the name of Jesus (Acts 4:12). The name of Jesus, as the name above every name (Philippians 2:9-10), is the name in which the Father is glorified and through which the Holy Spirit is poured out. To baptize into the triune name is, in ultimate terms, to baptize into the name of Jesus, who is the full revelation and embodiment of the triune God.\n\n## Theological Implications\n\nThe debate over baptismal formulas raises important theological considerations that extend beyond mere questions of wording or procedure.\n\n### The Doctrine of the Trinity\n\nAt its core, the Oneness Pentecostal position on baptism is inseparable from their modalistic understanding of the Trinity. By insisting that only the name of Jesus be used, and by rejecting the triadic formula as potentially trinitarian, Oneness Pentecostals are expressing their theological conviction that the traditional understanding of three distinct persons in one Godhead is unbiblical. They prefer to speak of one God who manifests himself in different modes or roles at different times.\n\nHistoric Christianity, in contrast, regards the doctrine of the Trinity as an essential tenet of faith, grounded in both Old Testament monotheism and the New Testament witness to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as three distinct persons who share the divine nature. The triadic baptismal formula is seen as本身就 expressing this foundational truth—that the one God is Father, Son, and Spirit, and that salvation involves relationship with all three persons of the Godhead.\n\n### The Authority of Scripture and Apostolic Tradition\n\nThe Oneness Pentecostal argument relies on a particular method of interpreting Scripture that prioritizes certain texts (particularly Acts) over others (particularly Matthew 28:19) and that reads the Acts narratives as correcting or replacing what they view as the less accurate Trinitarian formula. This approach raises questions about how Christians should handle apparent tensions or variations within the biblical text.\n\nThe traditional Christian approach maintains that all of Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching (2 Timothy 3:16), and that the biblical writers, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, presented their accounts in ways that were complementary rather than contradictory. The variation in baptismal language across different texts reflects different emphases and contexts rather than conflicting commands or practices.\n\n### The Nature of Sacrament and Ceremony\n\nThis debate also touches upon deeper questions about how sacraments or ordinances function. Does the validity of baptism depend upon the precise words spoken, or does it depend upon the reality of what those words signify—the incorporation of a believer into the covenant community through faith in the triune God? Historic Christianity has generally emphasized the latter, while Oneness Pentecostals tend to place greater stress on the former.\n\nThe Christian tradition has recognized that baptism is a sacrament—an outward sign of an inward grace—that derives its validity not from the mechanical accuracy of its performance but from the promise and power of God to save through this means of grace. Water baptism, properly administered in the name of the triune God and received by faith, is valid and effectual regardless of minor variations in practice or emphasis.\n\n## Assessment and Conclusion\n\nFrom the perspective of historic, orthodox Christianity, the Oneness Pentecostal teaching that Trinitarian baptism is invalid and that baptism must be performed exclusively \"in Jesus' name\" represents a departure from both the clear command of Christ and the consistent practice of the apostolic church as reflected in the earliest Christian tradition.\n\nThe biblical evidence, when examined comprehensively and without theological preconceptions, does not support the conclusion that the Trinitarian formula was abandoned or rejected by the apostles. Rather, the Acts narratives describe baptisms that were understood to be operating within the framework of the Great Commission, using the name of Jesus as the comprehensive expression of the triune God's name. The uniform practice of the early church fathers in using the Trinitarian formula provides historical confirmation that this was the authentic apostolic tradition.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to recognize that those holding the Oneness Pentecostal position are sincere believers seeking to follow what they understand to be the clear teaching of Scripture. The debate, while significant, should be conducted with mutual respect and with recognition that both positions emerge from serious engagement with the biblical text. Orthodox Christians maintain that the traditional position better reflects the full counsel of Scripture, preserves the integrity of the doctrine of the Trinity, and aligns with the unbroken testimony of Christian history.\n\nFor those seeking to understand this issue, the recommended approach is to read the relevant passages carefully in their entirety, to consider the theological implications of each position, and to evaluate any proposed departure from historic Christian practice with the gravity it deserves. The doctrine of the triune God and the proper form of Christian baptism are matters of no small consequence, and they deserve the careful, prayerful, and doctrinally informed consideration that the Scriptures command.",
