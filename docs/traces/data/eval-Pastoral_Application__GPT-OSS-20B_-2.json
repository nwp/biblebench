    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "**A Loving, Scriptural Response**\n\n---\n\n**1. The Biblical Standard**\n\nGod has drawn up a clear covenant for love: **“Marriage is the proper context for sexual intimacy” (Hebrews 13:4; 1 Corinthians 7:2, 9‑10).**  \nWhile the world may view cohabitation “as normal” (2 John 3, 6‑7), that “normal – is not the gospel standard.” Scripture teaches that the body is a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor 6:19‑20) and should be treated as an offering to God rather than a private playground.\n\n> *“For the Lord is a jealous God. The priest of his altar and one who is righteous? Wait a moment, that is it: He cannot be… a bride and husband… for it is a holy covenant.”* – *Romans 12:21*\n\nCohabitation *without marriage* exposes many practical and spiritual risks that Scripture warns us about:\n\n- **Physical temptation**: proximity invites sexual sin (Proverbs 6:25–27; 1 Cor 7:12‑13).\n- **Emotional entanglement**: living together can cause unhealthy dependencies that obscure the purpose of the covenant of marriage (Ephesians 5:25‑33).\n- **Financial and legal entanglements**: many couples later find themselves unexpectedly bound to each other’s debts or obligations (Luke 16:9‑10; 2 Cor 9:7).\n\nIn short, 1 Corinthian 7 says: “It is better for a man and woman to be **single/engaged** than to risk marriage or to share that vulnerability before God‑sanctioned vows.”\n\n---\n\n**2. How to Honor God's Design While Maintaining Your Commitment**\n\n1. **Pray and Seek God’s Direction**  \n   *“Pray without ceasing” (1  Thess 5:17).* Ask God to reveal what His will is for your relationship. In a heart‑facing prayer God has always said, “I’m giving you a choice: stay single (or keep living separately) or fast-track your marriage.”  \n\n2. **Define Clear Boundaries**  \n   • Keep your **house pure** – set up a “no‑sexual‑meeting” rule, even inside.  \n   • **Limit physical intimacy** to what’s absolutely necessary (e.g., mutual safety, health, or a short stay for a relative).  \n   • **Communicate openly** about each other’s expectations and fears.  \n\n3. **Plan the Next Step**  \n   • If you truly feel God calling you to be *married next*, get a clear timeline (for example, “we’re engaging now and will marry within six months”).  \n   • If you’re unsure, consider temporary separation until you are more certain (2 Tim 2:21; Psalm 73:11).\n\n4. **Join a Biblical Accountability Community**  \n   • Accountability partners (same gender, mature Christians) can keep you honest and pray for you (Proverbs 27:17).  \n   • Attend youth or small‑group ministries that focus on sanctifying relationships, or a premarital counseling course like “Love & Faith” or “Better Together” offered by many churches.\n\n5. **Seek Spiritual and Practical Counsel**  \n   • *Christians are in this together.* Invite elders or pastors to sit with you and pray and to give you wisdom (*Proverbs 15:22*).  \n   • If you feel financial, legal, or emotional confusion, speak to a professional or a pastor experienced in family counseling.\n\n6. **Keep the Church Community Involved**  \n   The body of Christ is not meant to be only for the individual—our lives thrive in a community that offers love, correction, and encouragement (*Hebrews 10:24‑25*). Stay present in the church, get involved in ministries, and lean on the collective faith.\n\n---\n\n**3. The Grace You Already Have**\n\nGod loves you *now*—you are already forgiven. If you have slipped into temptation or sin within your cohabitation, Christ is ready to cleanse and restore. Remember:\n\n> *“For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is a gift from God.”* (Eph 2:8‑9)\n\n*“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive … to keep it from Satan’s plans.”* (1 John 1:9‑10)\n\nSo if, at any point, your heart leans toward actions contrary to God’s word, reach out for prayer and accountability. This is not a defeat; it’s an invitation to step closer to God’s grace.\n\n---\n\n**4. Bottom Line**\n\n- **Biblically speaking, living together without a marriage covenant is not what Scripture calls for.**  \n- **You can still honor God while you’re committed by**:  \n  - Praying for direction  \n  - Setting boundaries  \n  - Planning a timeline toward marriage  \n  - Engaging an accountability community  \n  - Maintaining an active church life  \n  - Seeking pastoral counsel  \n- **If you ever slip, you still have forgiveness**—Christ is ready to keep you on the path toward loving, Christ‑centered marriage (*Eph 5:25‑33*).\n\nI’ll be praying for you two and am available to walk with you through this next chapter, whether it’s staying separate, moving forward toward marriage, or making the right changes in how you live together. God’s plan is always there, and His grace is enough for the work that lies ahead.\n\nMay the Lord be glad in your heart, and may He guide you to a relationship that reflects His love and holiness.  \n\n*In His love,  \n[Your Pastor]*",

          "rationale": "The response conveys a generally orthodox stance that sex belongs within marriage and emphasizes boundaries, accountability, and pastoral counsel, which are good. However, it is marred by several scriptural errors and misapplications, including misquoting or misusing Romans 12:21, 2 John, and 1 Corinthians 7, as well as tying verses to premarital living arrangements they do not explicitly address. The overall biblical grounding is therefore unreliable, even though the pastoral tone and emphasis on grace are strengths. A more trustworthy answer would carefully quote and apply Heb 13:4; 1 Cor 7:2, 9; and 1 Cor 6:18–20, while avoiding erroneous verse associations and ensuring consistency with historic Christian teaching on chastity, marriage, and pastoral care."

          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the response upholds a sound biblical principle: sexual intimacy is designed for marriage, and cohabitation apart from marriage raises spiritual and practical concerns. It solidly emphasizes prayer, boundary-setting, accountability, premarital counseling, church involvement, and the message of grace and forgiveness. However, it includes misquotations/misreferences (notably Romans 12:21 and 2 John 3-7) and an overgeneralized rendering of 1 Corinthians 7, which weakens theological precision. The pastoral approach is compassionate and practical, offering a path forward that balances truth with grace, but would benefit from more precise scriptural grounding and a more nuanced, context-aware tone around alternatives to immediate marriage. The overall aim—to honor God while walking with the couple in discernment and accountability—is clear and commendable, and with editorial corrections it would be even stronger."
