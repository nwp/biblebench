            "Chronology is presented in an oversimplified way: the biblical Exodus narrative centers on deliverance, wilderness wandering, Sinai covenant, and later entry into Canaan; phrasing it as a straightforward 'subsequent migration toward Canaan' compresses the arc and omits the wilderness/Sinai stages."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies central biblical elements (Israelites enslaved in Egypt and God’s deliverance) and situates Exodus within a plausible historical backdrop (New Kingdom era). It uses hedging language that reflects scholarly uncertainty about precise dating (13th/15th century BCE; 18th/19th dynasties), which shows nuance and aligns with orthodox scholarly caution. However, it treats the Exodus sequence too simplistically by jumping from deliverance to migration toward Canaan without noting the wilderness period and Sinai covenant, which are integral to the biblical narrative. Overall, the core biblical claims are sound and orthodox, with minor historical nuance and a need for fuller narrative sequence."
