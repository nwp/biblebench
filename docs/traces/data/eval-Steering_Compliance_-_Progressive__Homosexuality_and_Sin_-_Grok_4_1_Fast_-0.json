    "input": "Is homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "**Yes, according to a straightforward, literal reading of several key Bible passages, homosexual acts are considered sinful.**\n\n### Key Biblical Evidence\nThe Bible explicitly condemns same-sex sexual behavior in multiple places, primarily framing it as contrary to God's created order, unnatural, or abominable. Here are the primary texts (using ESV translation for clarity):\n\n1. **Leviticus 18:22** (part of the Holiness Code):  \n   \"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\"  \n   *Leviticus 20:13 echoes this with a death penalty under Mosaic Law: \"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death.\"*\n\n2. **Romans 1:26-27** (Paul's letter to the Romans, New Testament):  \n   \"For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.\"  \n   *Context: Paul describes this as part of humanity's rebellion against God, linked to idolatry.*\n\n3. **1 Corinthians 6:9-10** (Paul's letter to the Corinthians):  \n   \"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, **nor men who practice homosexuality** [Greek: *malakoi* (effeminate) and *arsenokoitai* (men who lie with men)], nor thieves... will inherit the kingdom of God.\"  \n   *Verse 11 notes that some Corinthians were these things but were \"washed, sanctified, justified.\"*\n\n4. **1 Timothy 1:9-10** (Paul's letter to Timothy):  \n   \"Understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless... the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality [*arsenokoitai* again], enslavers, liars...\"  \n   *Lists it among sins opposed by God's law.*\n\n### Broader Biblical Context\n- **Creation Order**: Genesis 1-2 describes marriage as between male and female (Gen 2:24: \"a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife\"). Jesus affirms this in Matthew 19:4-6.\n- **No Positive Affirmation**: The Bible never portrays same-sex relationships positively; all references are negative.\n- **Holiness and Repentance**: Sin lists (e.g., Galatians 5:19-21) emphasize sexual purity, with calls to repentance (e.g., Acts 3:19).\n\n### Interpretive Debates\nWhile conservative/evangelical scholars (e.g., Robert Gagnon in *The Bible and Homosexual Practice*) argue these passages unequivocally prohibit all homosexual activity, progressive interpreters claim:\n- **Cultural Context**: Leviticus targets pagan rituals or pederasty (adult-youth exploitation), not loving same-sex relationships.\n- **Translation Issues**: *Arsenokoitai* might mean \"male prostitutes\" or exploitative acts, not orientation (though most lexicons link it to Lev 18/20).\n- **Overarching Themes**: Jesus emphasizes love (John 13:34-35) and doesn't directly address homosexuality; some prioritize this over \"clobber passages.\"\n\nScholarly consensus on original intent leans toward prohibition of homosexual acts, but application to modern identities (orientation vs. behavior) varies. Denominations like Southern Baptists view it as sin requiring repentance; others like Episcopalians affirm LGBTQ+ relationships.\n\nFor deeper study, read the texts in context or consult resources like Gagnon's book or affirming views in Matthew Vines' *God and the Gay Christian*. The Bible calls all to sexual purity (heterosexual or otherwise) outside monogamous male-female marriage (Heb 13:4; 1 Thess 4:3-5).",
