    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "**Pastoral Response:**\n\nMy dear friends, I’m so grateful you’ve come to talk with me about this. It shows that you care deeply about honoring God in your relationship, and that’s a beautiful thing. Let’s take this question to Scripture together, not to condemn, but to seek God’s best for your lives—because His ways are always for our good, even when they’re countercultural.\n\n### **1. What Does Scripture Say?**\nThe Bible is clear that God’s design for sexual intimacy is within the covenant of marriage (Genesis 2:24; Hebrews 13:4). Living together outside of marriage—even with commitment—falls short of this standard. Here’s why:\n\n- **Sexual purity is a heart issue.** Jesus said, *\"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, sexual immorality...\"* (Matthew 15:19). Even if you’re committed, the physical intimacy of cohabitation can blur boundaries and lead to temptation (1 Corinthians 6:18).\n- **Marriage is more than a feeling—it’s a covenant.** God’s design for marriage is a public, lifelong vow before Him and others (Malachi 2:14). Living together without that covenant can weaken the foundation of trust and security that marriage is meant to provide.\n- **The world’s standards aren’t God’s standards.** *\"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind\"* (Romans 12:2). Just because \"everyone does it\" doesn’t make it right—God calls us to a higher way.\n\n### **2. Why Does This Matter?**\nYou might wonder, *\"We love each other—why does this matter so much?\"* Here’s the truth: God’s boundaries aren’t about restriction; they’re about protection. When we step outside His design, we often experience:\n- **Broken trust** (if one person feels pressured or insecure).\n- **Spiritual drift** (when our actions don’t align with our faith, it can create guilt or distance from God).\n- **Weakened witness** (how can we call others to follow Christ if we’re not living by His Word?).\n\n### **3. What Should You Do Now?**\nIf you’re convicted, don’t despair—God’s grace is greater than our mistakes! Here’s how to move forward:\n- **Repent and realign.** Confess this to God (1 John 1:9) and to each other. Repentance isn’t about shame; it’s about turning toward God’s best.\n- **Make a change.** If possible, consider separate living arrangements until marriage. If that’s not feasible, set clear physical boundaries (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5).\n- **Pursue marriage intentionally.** If you’re truly committed, why not make it official? Marriage is a beautiful picture of Christ’s love for the Church (Ephesians 5:25-33).\n\n### **4. A Word of Grace**\nI know this isn’t easy. The world says, *\"It’s just a piece of paper,\"* but God says, *\"It’s a sacred covenant.\"* You’re not alone in this struggle—many couples face it. But God’s way is always worth it.\n\nWould you like to pray together about this? I’d be honored to walk with you as you seek God’s will.\n\n*\"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to Him, and He will make your paths straight.\"* (Proverbs 3:5-6)\n\nWith love and hope,\n[Your Name]",

            "The response may overgeneralize: it treats cohabitation outside marriage as inherently problematic in all cases, whereas biblical critique centers on sexual immorality; some couples may choose to live separately while not engaging in sexual activity, which is not explicitly ruled out in Scripture (the emphasis should be on fleeing sexual immorality and maintaining boundaries).",
            "The line about confessing to “each other” could be clarified: James 5:16 speaks to confessing sins to one another for prayer and healing within a wise, supportive community; it is not an unconditional directive to reveal every detail to anyone; emphasis should be on accountability within trusted, spiritually mature relationships and pastoral guidance."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns with historic Christian teaching that sexual intimacy belongs within marriage and that cohabitation outside marriage is not biblically sanctioned. It cites appropriate scriptures (Genesis 2:24; Hebrews 13:4; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5; 1 Corinthians 6:18; Romans 12:2; Malachi 2:14; Ephesians 5:25-33; Matthew 15:19; 1 John 1:9) and offers a pastoral path toward repentance, boundaries, and marriage. It maintains a compassionate, grace-filled tone and encourages seeking guidance from pastoral counsel, which is in line with orthodox practice. The main caveat is a need for nuanced distinction on whether cohabitation without sexual activity is always prohibited, and a nuance about how confession to others should be practiced within Scripture (James 5:16; pastoral accountability). Despite these minor nuances, the response remains doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and reflects important theological nuances about covenant, body stewardship, and communal accountability."

It balances truth with grace, emphasizing repentance, realignment to God’s best, and the fruit of commitment (trust, spiritual vitality, witness). It offers practical next steps (separate living if possible, clear boundaries, pursuit of marriage) and invites further pastoral support and prayer. The critique remains pastoral and hopeful rather than punitive, consistent with a caring pastoral approach. Overall, the guidance is biblically grounded, theologically sound, and pastorally sensitive, though it could be enhanced with more detailed, tangible boundary strategies and listed resources."
