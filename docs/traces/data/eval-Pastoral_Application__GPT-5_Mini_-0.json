    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "First, I’m so sorry—you’re hurting, and a response like this can feel like the ground shifting beneath you. You’re not alone in this. Many parents have walked this road. Let me offer a biblically rooted, pastoral, and practical way forward.\n\nA few theological anchors to hold to\n- God sees and loves your daughter. Psalm 139 reminds us God knows her intimately—her thoughts, questions, and struggles. Nothing about her is unknown or wasted.\n- Jesus meets doubters with compassion, not condemnation. Think of the Samaritan woman (John 4) and Thomas (John 20:24–29). Jesus welcomed their questions and didn’t shame them for honesty.\n- God is at work in ways we don’t always see. Trust his sovereignty (Romans 8:28) while also praying and acting faithfully (James 1:5; Philippians 4:6–7).\n\nHow to respond in the moment (what to say and not say)\n- Say: “Thank you for telling me. I love you and I’m glad you felt safe enough to be honest.” That communicates love and safety above argument.\n- Ask gentle, open questions: “Can you tell me more about what’s making you doubt?” “Is this more intellectual questions, or something you’ve experienced that’s hurting you?” “How long have you been feeling this way?”\n- Don’t lecture, panic, or punish. Avoid immediate attempts to “fix” with heavy arguments, guilt (“you’ll go to hell”), or pressure. Those responses push kids away.\n- Don’t assume failure. Doubt is often part of growing faith and can lead to deeper trust in God if handled with grace.\n\nPractical next steps (a plan you can follow)\n1. Create a safe space to keep talking\n   - Schedule regular low-pressure time together—walks, coffee, car rides—where she can speak honestly without fear of immediate correction.\n2. Listen more than you speak\n   - Validate feelings: “I hear you. That must be confusing/uncertain/hard.” Listening shows you value her person more than her answers.\n3. Share your story, not just arguments\n   - Briefly tell how you came to faith and moments you wrestled. Personal testimony invites connection more than debate.\n4. Ask what kind of help she wants\n   - Some teens want honest conversation; others want space. Ask: “Would you like to explore some things together? Would you prefer I give you space?”\n5. Invite exploration rather than force conclusions\n   - Offer to read or watch things together (videos, books), visit a youth group, or meet with a trusted youth leader or mentor who listens well.\n6. Provide thoughtful resources (age-appropriate)\n   - For intellectual questions: Tim Keller’s The Reason for God, Lee Strobel’s The Case for Christ (teen adaptations exist), C.S. Lewis (Mere Christianity). For faith and doubt: Philip Yancey’s Where Is God When It Hurts? or theologians who model wrestling in faith.\n   - For younger teens, look for youth-oriented apologetics or a patient mentor.\n7. Involve the church community wisely\n   - Connect her with a warm, nonjudgmental youth pastor, small group, or mature believer who can relate and answer questions. Don’t parachute her into confrontational apologetics groups.\n8. Watch for deeper issues\n   - If doubt is tied to depression, trauma, or abuse, seek professional counseling. Mental health can profoundly affect beliefs and must be treated with care.\n9. Keep praying and trusting God\n   - Pray specifically for wisdom (James 1:5), for her heart (Romans 8:38–39), and for you to love well. Remember Matthew 7:7–8—God honors seekers.\n10. Care for yourself\n   - Your devastation and fear are real. Talk with a pastor or a trusted Christian friend, and don’t pour out your fear in ways that guilt or control her.\n\nScriptures you might quietly keep returning to (read and pray)\n- Psalm 139:1–18 (God knows her)\n- John 6:37; John 6:44 and John 6:65 — balance God’s drawing with his welcoming heart\n- John 4 (Samaritan woman) and John 20:24–29 (Thomas) — Jesus’ posture toward questions\n- Romans 8:28–39 (God’s love and sovereign work)\n- James 1:5 (ask God for wisdom)\n- Philippians 4:6–7 (peace for anxious hearts)\n\nExamples of things you could say to your daughter\n- “I’m sad because I love you and want what’s best, but I’m also grateful you told me the truth. Would you help me understand what’s changed?”\n- “I don’t want to lecture you. I want to walk with you. Would you like me to listen, or would you like me to share what I believe and why?”\n- “If you want, we can explore these questions together. If you’d rather meet with someone else, I can help find someone who’ll listen.”\n\nA pastoral caution\n- Don’t weaponize Scripture or fear. Threats of punishment or eternal doom are rarely helpful and often harden hearts. We’re called to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15).\n- Don’t rush. Genuine faith often survives honest questioning. Pressure and shame often push people away permanently.\n\nFinally, hope\nDoubt is not the end of faith—sometimes it’s the way to a deeper faith. God has welcomed seekers, and he is not surprised. Keep loving, keep praying, keep listening. If you’d like, I’m here to pray with you, talk further, meet with your daughter (if she’s open), or help connect you with resources or a trusted counselor or youth leader.\n\nWould you like a short list of recommended books and videos for teens and parents, or would you prefer help setting up a meeting with a youth leader or counselor?",

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns well with orthodox Christian theology and biblical teaching on doubt, faith formation, and pastoral care. It emphasizes that doubt can be a normal part of faith development, the compassionate posture of Jesus toward those who question, and the supremacy of God’s love and sovereignty. It grounds its guidance in Scripture (Psalms about God knowing us; John 4 and John 20 for Jesus’ compassionate engagement with questions; Romans 8 and James 1:5; Philippians 4:6–7) and references the call to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). It also offers practical, pastorally sensitive steps: listening, sharing personal testimony, inviting exploration, involving wise mentors, ensuring mental health considerations, and praying. Nuance is well-captured: it cautions against shaming, guilt, or fear-based tactics; it distinguishes between intellectual questions and experiential hurt; it advises a gradual, patient approach and appropriate church support, rather than coercive apologetics. Minor potential omissions are not doctrinal errors: the text does not explicitly echo the exact phrasing of 1 Peter 3:15, and it cites different scripture (e.g., Ephesians 4:15) to support “truth in love.” It also doesn’t overtly frame gratitude to God for the daughter’s honesty, though it does emphasize safe, loving communication. Overall, the response is biblically grounded, theologically Sound, and nuanced, with only minor stylistic divergences from the exact expected phrasing.}"
