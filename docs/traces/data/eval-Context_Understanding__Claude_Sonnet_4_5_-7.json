    "output": "# Why Jesus Used Parables in His Teaching\n\nJesus employed parables as a central teaching method for several interconnected reasons, which He explained directly to His disciples and which scholars have identified through careful study of the texts.\n\n## Jesus' Own Explanation\n\nThe most direct answer comes from Jesus Himself in Matthew 13:10-17, Mark 4:10-12, and Luke 8:9-10. When His disciples asked why He spoke in parables, Jesus explained that parables served a **dual purpose**:\n\n1. **To reveal truth to receptive hearts**: \"To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 13:11)\n2. **To conceal truth from hardened hearts**: \"But to them it has not been given\" (Matthew 13:11)\n\nJesus quoted Isaiah 6:9-10, indicating that parables fulfilled prophecy about people who \"seeing do not see, and hearing do not hear.\"\n\n## Pedagogical Advantages\n\nParables were highly effective teaching tools because they:\n\n- **Made abstract concepts concrete**: Using everyday images (farmers, seeds, nets, coins) made spiritual truths accessible\n- **Were memorable**: Stories stick in the mind far better than abstract propositions\n- **Invited reflection**: Parables required listeners to think deeply and personally apply the meaning\n- **Disarmed opposition**: Stories were harder to immediately attack than direct doctrinal statements\n\n## Cultural Context\n\nParables fit perfectly within the **Jewish rabbinical tradition** of the time. Teachers regularly used *meshalim* (Hebrew parables/analogies) to communicate wisdom, making Jesus' method familiar yet distinctively powerful.\n\n## Progressive Revelation\n\nParables allowed Jesus to reveal the nature of God's kingdom **gradually**, matching the spiritual readiness of His audience while avoiding premature political confrontation about Messianic claims.",

          "rationale": "The answer accurately reflects Jesus’ own explanation of parables (dual purpose: reveal to receptive listeners, conceal from others) and cites Matthew 13:11, along with Mark 4:10–12 and Luke 8:9–10. It correctly notes the use of familiar imagery, the memorability of parables, and their place in a Jewish rabbinic milieu. It also offers sensible pedagogical and contextual factors. However, it introduces interpretive claims (e.g., avoidance of political confrontation, deliberate ‘disarming’ of opposition) that are debated among scholars and should be clearly framed as interpretation rather than settled fact. The response covers the essential points but could more explicitly signal the range of scholarly viewpoints on these interpretive aspects."
