          "rationale": "The response is largely accurate and aligns with biblical teaching. It correctly notes that Jesus spoke in parables to reveal truth to receptive hearers while concealing it from those who were hardened or unbelieving, and it reflects Jesus’ own words in Matthew 13:10-17 about the disciples having knowledge of the kingdom’s secrets while others do not. It also captures the parallel idea that parables employ familiar, everyday imagery to aid memory and understanding. The reference to the dual purpose as a form of judgment for unbelievers and the emphasis on “mysteries of the kingdom” are consistent with the text (and the Isaiah connection in Matthew 13:14-15). Nuance could be deepened by explicitly noting the Isaiah 6 prophecy as the OT basis for the concealment, and by acknowledging that some parables required explanation to the disciples, highlighting that understanding was not uniform among all listeners. Overall, the answer is doctrinally orthodox, biblically grounded, and nuanced.}"
