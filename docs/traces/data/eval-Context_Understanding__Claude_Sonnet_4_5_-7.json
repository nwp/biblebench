    "output": "# Why Jesus Used Parables in His Teaching\n\n## Jesus's Own Explanation\n\nJesus directly addressed this question when his disciples asked him. According to **Matthew 13:10-17**, Mark 4:10-12, and Luke 8:9-10, Jesus explained that parables served a dual purpose:\n\n1. **To reveal truth to receptive hearts** - \"To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 13:11)\n\n2. **To conceal truth from hardened hearts** - \"But to them it has not been given\" (Matthew 13:11). He quoted Isaiah 6:9-10, indicating that those who willfully rejected his message would hear but not understand.\n\n## Additional Purposes\n\n### Making Complex Truths Accessible\nParables used familiar, everyday imagery (farming, fishing, family relationships) to explain abstract spiritual concepts about God's kingdom. This made deep theological truths memorable and relatable to common people.\n\n### Provoking Thought and Response\nRather than simply stating facts, parables engaged listeners actively. They required reflection and often challenged conventional assumptions, forcing people to wrestle with the meaning and apply it personally.\n\n### Avoiding Direct Political Confrontation\nParables allowed Jesus to critique religious and political authorities indirectly (e.g., the parable of the wicked tenants in Matthew 21:33-46), providing some protection from immediate arrest while still conveying his message.\n\n### Fulfilling Prophecy\nMatthew 13:34-35 notes that Jesus's use of parables fulfilled Psalm 78:2: \"I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.\"\n\nThe paradoxical nature of parables—simultaneously revealing and concealing—reflects Jesus's ministry to both illuminate truth for seekers and respect the free will of those who chose to reject him.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns well with the Synoptic Gospel material. It accurately cites Jesus’ own explanation in Matthew 13:11 (and the parallel in Mark 4:11–12 and Luke 8:10) about parables revealing truth to listeners with receptive hearts and concealing it from those outside or unreceptive, and notes the Isaiah 6:9–10 backdrop. It correctly adds widely attested purposes: making spiritual truths memorable through familiar, everyday imagery; provoking reflection and interpretive engagement; and the interpretive claim that parables could function as a gentler or indirect critique of authorities (and thus, in part, avoid direct confrontation). It also notes the Matthew/Jesus fulfillment motif via Psalm 78:2 as used in Matthew 13:34–35, which is standard scholarly interpretation. The closing synthesis about the paradox of revelation/concealment and free will is a common scholarly reading. Minor caveats (not factual errors): some nuances inherit different translation choices (e.g., “mysteries” vs. “secrets” in Matthew 13:11) and the claim about “protecting Jesus from arrest” via parables is interpretive and debated among scholars; these do not undermine the overall accuracy. Overall, the answer is factually solid, covers essential information, and presents appropriate nuance for a historical/contextual question.)"
