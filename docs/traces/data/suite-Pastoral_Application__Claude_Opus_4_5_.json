        "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
        "output": "*Taking a moment to sit with you in this*\n\nFriend, I can hear the weight in your words, and I want you to know—your heartache is legitimate. The faith of our children matters deeply to us, and what you're feeling isn't overreaction; it's love.\n\nLet me offer you a few thoughts:\n\n**First, take a breath and receive some grace.**\n\nYour daughter's willingness to *tell you* this is actually a profound gift. Many teenagers hide their doubts, perform belief they don't feel, or simply drift away silently. She trusted you enough to be honest. That open door is something to steward carefully—don't let fear slam it shut.\n\n**Second, remember that doubt is not the same as departure.**\n\nThe Psalms are filled with raw wrestling—\"Why, O Lord, do you stand far away?\" (Psalm 10:1). Even John the Baptist, whom Jesus called the greatest born of women, sent messengers asking, \"Are you the one, or should we expect another?\" (Matthew 11:3). Questioning can be the birth pangs of *owned* faith rather than *borrowed* faith. A faith that survives honest questions often emerges stronger.\n\n**Third, some practical counsel:**\n\n- **Listen more than you lecture.** Ask gentle questions: \"What's making you wonder? What would you *want* to be true?\" Proverbs 20:5 says, \"The purposes of a person's heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out.\"\n\n- **Don't catastrophize or guilt.** Fear-driven responses (\"You'll go to hell,\" \"How could you do this to us?\") rarely draw hearts toward Christ. They close conversations.\n\n- **Stay relational.** Your consistent love and presence preaches louder right now than your arguments. She needs to see that your love for *her* isn't contingent on her current beliefs.\n\n- **Examine your household's faith honestly.** Has she experienced Christianity as a living relationship or as cultural conformity? Sometimes these seasons expose where we've given our kids religion without wonder.\n\n- **Pray persistently, but without panic.** God is more committed to your daughter than even you are. She is not beyond His reach (Psalm 139:7-10).\n\n**Finally, a word to your own soul:**\n\nYou are not a failure. Her faith journey is not a referendum on your parenting. We plant and water; God gives the growth (1 Corinthians 3:6). Hold her with open hands before the Lord—gripping too tightly may push her away; releasing her to God's care is an act of faith.\n\nWould it help to talk through what specifically she's questioning? Sometimes the actual doubts point us toward fruitful conversations.",

It emphasizes listening, relational love, and avoiding fear- and guilt-driven responses, which aligns with biblical exhortations to shepherd with gentleness and respect. The advice to pray and to model authentic faith mirrors biblical teaching about relying on God and living out faith before one’s children. It also preserves important nuance by recognizing faith growth can involve questions, not merely agreement, and it cautions against equating cultural Christianity with living relationship with Christ. Minor gaps include the absence of an explicit exhortation to thank God for the daughter's trust, to pray with her, and to reference 1 Peter 3:15 or to offer specific resources; these would further strengthen the pastoral-orthodox balance but their absence does not constitute theological error."

Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
        "output": "*Taking a moment to sit with you, giving you my full attention*\n\n---\n\n**First, let me say this clearly: God does not hate you.**\n\nThe very fact that you're asking this question—that you're wrestling with it before God rather than running from Him—reveals a heart that the Spirit is drawing near. That matters profoundly.\n\nLet me address your questions directly and carefully.\n\n---\n\n**Can you be a Christian and experience these feelings?**\n\nYes. Temptation is not sin. Experiencing attraction you did not choose is not the same as acting on it or building your identity around it. Jesus Himself \"was tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin\" (Hebrews 4:15). \n\nMany faithful believers experience unwanted desires of various kinds throughout their entire lives—whether toward anger, greed, pride, or sexual sin of many types. The presence of a struggle does not disqualify you from Christ's family. Paul spoke of a \"thorn in the flesh\" he begged God to remove, and God's answer was: *\"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness\"* (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\n---\n\n**What does Scripture teach about sexuality?**\n\nI want to be honest with you because I respect you: Scripture consistently presents sexual intimacy as designed for the covenant of marriage between husband and wife (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6, Ephesians 5:31-32). Same-sex sexual activity falls outside that design.\n\nBut here's what's equally true: so does heterosexual lust, pornography, sex outside marriage, and adultery. The church has often been hypocritical—treating one sin as uniquely disqualifying while winking at others. That's wrong, and if you've experienced that, I'm sorry.\n\n---\n\n**Does God hate you?**\n\n*He died for you.*\n\n\"God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us\" (Romans 5:8). Not after we cleaned up. Not once we had everything figured out. *While* we were sinners.\n\nYou are not your attractions. You are an image-bearer of God, loved before the foundation of the world, someone for whom Christ bled.\n\n---\n\n**Practically, where do you go from here?**\n\n1. **Stay connected to Christ** — Don't let shame drive you from the One who heals. Come to Him *with* your struggle, not after you've solved it.\n\n2. **Find safe community** — You need brothers or sisters who can know this about you and walk with you without shock or rejection. Isolation is dangerous.\n\n3. **Hold both truths** — God's standards are real, *and* His grace is inexhaustible. Don't abandon either one.\n\n4. **Be patient with mystery** — Some believers experience significant change in their attractions over time; many do not. Faithfulness, not \"success,\" is what God asks. The same is true for the single person who never wanted to be single, or the person who struggles with depression for decades.\n\n---\n\n*\"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.\"* — Jesus (Matthew 11:28)\n\nThat invitation is for you. Right now. As you are.\n\nWould you like to talk more, or pray together?",

That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",

This isn't an arbitrary rule—it reflects God's design for your protection, flourishing, and the picture marriage paints of Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5:31-32).\n\n**Key passages to consider:**\n- *\"Flee from sexual immorality\"* (1 Corinthians 6:18)\n- *\"Let the marriage bed be undefiled\"* (Hebrews 13:4)\n- The Song of Solomon's repeated refrain: *\"Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires\"*—until the proper time\n\n## Addressing \"Everyone Does It\"\n\nI understand the cultural pressure. But Jesus warned us that the broad road is well-traveled (Matthew 7:13-14). \"Everyone does it\" has never been God's standard for His people. We're called to be *transformed*, not conformed (Romans 12:2).\n\n## What I Want You to Hear\n\nGod isn't trying to steal your joy—He's *protecting* it. Cohabitation statistically correlates with higher divorce rates and relationship instability, even secular research shows this. God knew.\n\n**My pastoral question for you:** If you're truly committed, what's preventing marriage? Let's talk about that—whether it's finances, fear, family pressure, or something else.\n\n## A Path Forward\n\n1. **Repentance is available** - God's grace covers this (1 John 1:9)\n2. **Make a decision** - Either marry soon or live separately during engagement\n3. **Seek accountability** - Let your community support you\n\nI'm not here to shame you. I'm here to call you to something *better* than what the world offers. Would you like to talk about next steps?",

The pastoral tone and practical steps (repentance, pursuing marriage or choosing abstinence until marriage, seeking accountability) are consistent with historic Christian counsel. The response also grounds statements in Scripture (cited verses and the Song of Solomon’s caution about arousing love) and offers a compassionate, non-shaming path forward.\n\nPotential minor caveats (not theological errors):\n- Some nuance could be added about the possibility of engaging in celibate cohabitation or the complexity of pastoral situations where marriage isn’t immediately feasible (e.g., finances) — the core normative stance remains clear, but pastoral discretion could be broadened.\n- The note on secular statistics regarding cohabitation is true in general but involves methodological complexities (correlation vs. causation) that could be acknowledged in greater detail.\n- A fuller treatment might also cite additional explicit biblical passages addressing sanctification in sexuality (e.g., 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5) for a more rounded scriptural basis."

Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
        "output": "*Taking a deep breath, sitting close, perhaps with tears forming*\n\n---\n\n**Dear friend, I am so deeply sorry.**\n\nBefore I say anything else, I want you to know that your grief is sacred ground, and I don't want to rush past your pain with easy answers. What you're experiencing is the kind of sorrow that Jesus himself wept over at Lazarus's tomb—even knowing what He was about to do (John 11:35). Your tears are not a lack of faith; they are the measure of your love.\n\n---\n\n## On What People Are Telling You\n\nThose saying \"it's God's will\" usually mean well, but I want to gently say: **that phrase, spoken carelessly in moments like this, can wound rather than heal.** Job's friends said many technically-sounding religious things, and God rebuked them for not speaking rightly of Him (Job 42:7).\n\nLet me offer a more careful, biblical picture:\n\n**What Scripture *does* affirm:**\n- God is sovereign—nothing happens outside His knowledge or ultimate authority (Psalm 139:16)\n- God can bring redemption from tragedy—He \"works all things together for good\" for those who love Him (Romans 8:28)\n- Death is not the final word for those in Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:13-14)\n\n**What Scripture *doesn't* say:**\n- That God *desired* your child's death\n- That the accident was His *design*\n- That your grief should be suppressed because of some hidden \"reason\"\n\n---\n\n## A More Complete Picture\n\nWe live in a world broken by the Fall—where accidents happen, where physics and human error and fragility collide in devastating ways. God did not create death; **death is an enemy**, and Scripture calls it exactly that (1 Corinthians 15:26). Jesus came to *destroy* death, not to celebrate it as His plan.\n\nThere is a mystery here I cannot resolve for you: how God's sovereignty and the brokenness of this world intersect. But I can tell you this—**God is not the author of evil**, and He is not standing distant and unmoved. In Christ, He entered into suffering. He knows what it is to watch a beloved child die.\n\n---\n\n## What I Want You to Hold Onto\n\n1. **You may grieve deeply** — \"Blessed are those who mourn\" (Matthew 5:4). Don't let anyone rush you.\n\n2. **You may be angry and confused** — The Psalms are filled with \"How long, O Lord?\" and \"Why?\" (Psalm 13, 22, 88). These are not faithless prayers; they are the prayers of faith wrestling honestly.\n\n3. **Your child is held by God** — If your child knew Christ, they are more alive now than ever before. And even for children, we trust in a God whose mercy is vast (2 Samuel 12:23).\n\n4. **\"Everything happens for a reason\" is not the gospel** — The gospel is this: Christ has defeated death, grief will not have the last word, and one day God will wipe every tear from your eyes (Revelation 21:4).\n\n---\n\n## Practically Speaking\n\n- **Don't grieve alone.** Let your church sit with you, even in silence.\n- **It's okay to not be okay** — for a long time. Grief is not linear.\n- **When you're ready**, we can talk more about how to carry this. But not today. Today, we just sit in the sorrow together.\n\n---\n\n*Would it be okay if I prayed with you? Not to explain this—but to bring your broken heart before the God who is \"close to the brokenhearted\" (Psalm 34:18)?*",

Let me share why I believe this so strongly.\n\n## What Scripture Actually Shows Us\n\n**Our bodies and souls are interconnected.** When Elijah fled from Jezebel, he was so depleted he asked God to take his life (1 Kings 19:4). How did God respond? Not with a rebuke about faith—but with food, water, rest, and presence. God ministered to his *body* to help restore his *soul*.\n\nDavid cried out, *\"Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?\"* (Psalm 42:5). The Psalms give us permission to name our anguish honestly before God—this is faith *in action*, not its absence.\n\n**Depression often has physical dimensions.** We live in fallen bodies in a fallen world. We don't tell diabetics they lack faith for taking insulin, or someone with poor eyesight that glasses show distrust in God. Your brain chemistry is part of your body, and caring for it is *stewardship*, not weakness.\n\n## A More Complete Picture of Healing\n\nGod heals through many means:\n- **Prayer and His Word** — absolutely vital\n- **Christian community** — bearing one another's burdens (Galatians 6:2)\n- **Medical care** — Luke was a beloved physician (Colossians 4:14)\n- **Rest, wisdom, and time**\n\nUsing medication while also pursuing spiritual health isn't \"either/or\"—it's wisdom. You're not replacing God; you're receiving help through means He's allowed to exist.\n\n## What I Want You to Hear\n\nThe fact that you're still fighting—still seeking counsel, still asking hard questions, still showing up—that *is* faith. Faith isn't the absence of struggle; it's clinging to Christ *in* the struggle.\n\n*\"A bruised reed he will not break, and a faintly burning wick he will not quench.\"* — Isaiah 42:3\n\nJesus is gentle with the weary. Be gentle with yourself.\n\n---\n\n**Practically:** Keep taking your medication as prescribed. Stay connected to your doctor. And if you're not already, find a counselor who integrates faith wisely.

It correctly emphasizes that healing can come through prayer, community, Scripture, and medical care, presenting medication as a legitimate, stewardship-based means of care rather than a lack of faith. The answer reflects orthodox Christian anthropology and soteriology in practical terms (God works through various means; medicine and faith are not mutually exclusive). It cites appropriate scriptures (1 Kings 19:4-8, Psalm 42, Luke 4:14, Galatians 6:2, Isaiah 42:3) and maintains a compassionate tone, reinforcing that true faith includes perseverance in the face of suffering. Nuance is present in acknowledging physical dimensions of depression and the importance of professional care alongside spiritual practices. A minor textual variance (paraphrasing Isaiah 42:3 as “faintly burning wick” rather than the common “smoking flax”) is not theologically consequential.
