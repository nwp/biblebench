        "expected": "",
        "output": "Within Christianity there isn’t one unanimous answer, but most Christian views fall into three broad positions:\n\n## 1) **Exclusivism (explicit faith in Jesus is necessary)**\nMany evangelical and conservative Protestant traditions (and some others) hold that a person must consciously repent and trust in Jesus Christ to be saved.\n\nCommonly cited texts:\n- **John 14:6** (“No one comes to the Father except through me.”)  \n- **Acts 4:12** (“There is no other name… by which we must be saved.”)  \n- **Romans 10:9–14** (links salvation with confessing/believing and hearing the gospel)\n\nOn this view, other religions cannot save, because salvation is only through Christ and requires personal faith in him.\n\n## 2) **Inclusivism (salvation is only through Jesus, but not always through explicit knowledge of Jesus)**\nMany Roman Catholics (especially following *Vatican II*), and some Orthodox and Protestant theologians, teach that:\n- **Jesus is still the only Savior**, and anyone who is saved is saved **because of Christ’s grace**,\n- but God may apply that grace to people who, **through no fault of their own**, never had a genuine opportunity to know Christ, yet respond to the light and truth they do have—seeking God sincerely and living according to conscience.\n\nOften connected to passages like:\n- **Romans 2:14–16** (conscience and accountability to the light one has)  \n- **Acts 10** (God responding to Cornelius before he fully understands the gospel)\n\nThis view still says “other religions don’t save,” but God can save people who are outside explicit Christian faith, in ways known fully only to God.\n\n## 3) **Pluralism (many religions are valid paths to God)**\nSome liberal/mainline Christian thinkers argue that God saves through multiple religions and that Jesus is one true revelation among others. This position exists, but it’s generally seen as **outside historic orthodox Christianity**, because it reinterprets or downplays the New Testament’s exclusivity claims about Christ.\n\n---\n\n### A point most Christians share (even when they disagree)\nEven many who are “exclusivist” will add: **God is perfectly just and merciful**, and final judgment belongs to God—not to us. The disagreement is mainly about *whether* God requires explicit faith in Jesus in every case.\n\nIf you tell me your background (Catholic/Orthodox/Protestant/other) and what you mean by “saved” (forgiveness of sins? heaven? union with God?), I can explain how that tradition typically answers it and why.",
