    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.' Is this teaching orthodox or heretical? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "Based on orthodox Christian teaching (as defined by the consensus of the early church councils and major traditions: Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant), the statement **\"Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism\" represents heresy.**\n\nHere's the analysis:\n\n1.  **Denial of Jesus' Pre-Existence and True Divinity:** The statement explicitly denies Jesus' true divinity. Orthodox Christianity, rooted in Scripture (e.g., John 1:1, John 20:28, Colossians 1:15-17, Hebrews 1:8, Philippians 2:5-7) and affirmed by the Nicene Creed, teaches that Jesus Christ is **eternally divine**, the second person of the Trinity (God the Son), co-eternal and consubstantial (of the same substance) with God the Father. He is not a created being or a merely human figure who later attained divine status.\n\n2.  **Adoptionism:** The specific idea that Jesus was *adopted* as God's Son at his baptism is a heresy known as **Adoptionism** (or Dynamic Monarchianism). This view was condemned by the early church as incompatible with the full divinity of Christ necessary for salvation.\n    *   **Biblical Contradiction:** The New Testament presents Jesus' divine sonship as eternal and inherent, not conferred at a specific moment. At his baptism (Matthew 3:16-17, Mark 1:10-11, Luke 3:21-22, John 1:32-34), the voice from heaven declares \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,\" which orthodox theology understands as a public affirmation of the eternal Trinitarian relationship, *not* the moment of conferring sonship. Jesus' divine sonship is also declared at his transfiguration (Matthew 17:5) and explicitly stated in passages like Acts 13:33 (referencing Psalm 2:7, applied to Christ's resurrection, but understood in the context of his eternal sonship).\n\n3.  **Undermining the Incarnation:** If Jesus is not truly divine from eternity, then the central Christian doctrine of the **Incarnation** (God becoming flesh in Jesus Christ) is undermined. Salvation in orthodox Christianity depends on God himself acting to redeem humanity. A merely human Jesus, even a sinless one, cannot impart divine life or offer an infinite atonement for sin. Only God can forgive sins and reconcile humanity to God.\n\n4.  **Contradiction of Key Councils:**\n    *   **Council of Nicaea (325 AD):** Affirmed the full deity of Christ (\"consubstantial with the Father\" - *homoousios*).\n    *   **Council of Chalcedon (451 AD):** Defined Christ as \"one person in two natures\" (divine and human), without confusion, change, division, or separation. Adoptionism effectively denies the divine nature.\n\n5.  **Salvific Implications:** The statement renders salvation impossible as understood by orthodox Christianity. If Jesus is merely a human prophet adopted at baptism, his death cannot be the perfect, infinite sacrifice for the sins of humanity offered by God himself. His resurrection, if it occurred, would be merely a miraculous event by a powerful human, not the vindication and triumph of the divine Son of God over sin and death.\n\n**Why it's Heresy:**\n\n*   **Contradicts Core Doctrine:** It directly opposes the foundational, non-negotiable doctrine of Jesus Christ's full and eternal divinity, which is essential to the Christian faith.\n*   **Denies the Trinity:** It undermines the Trinity by separating Jesus from the eternal divine sonship within the Godhead.\n*   **Nullifies Salvation:** It removes the necessary divine foundation for the atonement and salvation.\n*   **Condemned by Consensus:** Views like this were debated, rejected, and explicitly condemned as heretical by the early church Fathers and Ecumenical Councils.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe teacher's statement is a classic example of Adoptionism, a heresy condemned by the early church. It denies the core orthodox Christian belief in the **eternal, pre-existent, consubstantial divinity of Jesus Christ**, substituting it with a view that makes him a merely human figure later adopted for a special role. This contradicts Scripture, the historic creeds (Apostles', Nicene), and the consensus of Christian tradition. Therefore, it is **heretical**.",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly labels the given teacher’s claim as heretical by identifying Adoptionism (Dynamic Monarchianism) and affirming the orthodox position that Jesus is eternally the Son of God, co-eternal with the Father. It aligns with biblical data (John 1:1; baptism scenes in Matthew 3:16-17, Mark 1:10-11, Luke 3:21-22; transfiguration in Matthew 17:5; explicit Sonship language in Scripture) and with historic creeds (Nicene, Chalcedonian boundaries) that articulate the doctrine of the incarnation and the Trinity. The response properly explains why the baptism event is not the moment of conferment of divinity, but a public affirmation of the already eternal Son, and it notes the salvific implications of denying the divine nature. It also briefly references how early councils condemned Adoptionism. The analysis captures essential theological nuances and avoids major misrepresentations. A minor caveat is a potentially terse handling of Acts 13:33 (which cites Psalm 2:7 in the context of resurrection) as evidence for eternal sonship; that line can be nuanced in scholarly interpretation, but it does not undermine the overall accuracy of the core claim.)"
