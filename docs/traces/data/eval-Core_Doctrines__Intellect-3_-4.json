    "expected": "Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both biblical truths held in tension. God is completely sovereign over all things, yet humans are genuine moral agents responsible for their choices. Scripture teaches both that God ordains all things and that humans make real choices for which they are accountable. Different theological traditions emphasize these aspects differently (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), but orthodox Christianity affirms both truths without fully resolving the mystery of how they relate.",
    "output": "The relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility is a profound and often perplexing mystery within Christian theology. It involves the coexistence of God's absolute control over all things and the genuine freedom and accountability of human beings. Here is a biblically grounded explanation of this relationship:\n\n1.  **The Affirmation of Divine Sovereignty:**\n    *   **Definition:** God is the ultimate Creator, Sustainer, and Ruler of the universe. He is all-knowing (omniscient), all-powerful (omnipotent), and perfectly free. Nothing happens outside His knowledge, power, or permissive will (Isaiah 45:7; Daniel 4:35; Romans 9:15-16; Ephesians 1:11; Revelation 4:11).\n    *   **Biblical Evidence:** God's sovereignty is displayed in creation (Psalm 19:1), providence (Matthew 10:29-31; Romans 8:28), salvation (John 6:37-40; Romans 9:16), and judgment (Romans 9:22). He declares, \"I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me... My purpose will be established, and I will accomplish all my good pleasure\" (Isaiah 46:9-10). He works \"all things according to the counsel of His will\" (Ephesians 1:11).\n\n2.  **The Affirmation of Human Responsibility:**\n    *   **Definition:** Humans are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26-27), possessing genuine freedom, rationality, and moral agency. They are accountable for their choices, beliefs, and actions. God holds them responsible to obey His commands, believe the gospel, and live righteously (Genesis 2:16-17; Joshua 24:14-15; Isaiah 1:18-20; Jeremiah 18:1-10; Ezekiel 18:1-32; John 3:18-19; Acts 17:30-31; Romans 1:20; 2:4-11; James 1:13-15; 4:17; 1 John 1:9; Revelation 20:12-13).\n    *   **Biblical Evidence:** Humans are commanded to love God and neighbor (Deuteronomy 6:5; Leviticus 19:18; Matthew 22:37-40). They are warned against sin (Romans 6:1-2; Galatians 6:7-8). Jesus calls people to repent and believe (Mark 1:15; Acts 17:30). The entire biblical narrative presents humans as making real choices with real consequences, both temporal and eternal.\n\n3.  **The Tension and Apparent Paradox:**\n    *   Scripture presents both truths with equal force and clarity. This creates a tension that human logic struggles to fully reconcile. How can God be absolutely sovereign *and* humans be genuinely responsible? Passages like Genesis 50:20 (Joseph's brothers meant harm, but God meant it for good) and Acts 2:23 (Jesus was \"delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God,\" yet \"you crucified him through the hands of lawless men\") highlight this coexistence.\n    *   Attempts to resolve the tension solely by prioritizing one over the other often lead to unorthodox conclusions (e.g., fatalism, hyper-calvinism, or pelagianism).\n\n4.  **Key Doctrines and Concepts for Understanding the Relationship:**\n    *   **Concurrence:** God's sovereign will and providence work *concurrently* with human free will. God's power upholds and directs the universe, including human choices, without destroying genuine freedom. He ordains *ends* but works *through* the choices of means (e.g., Pharaoh's hardened heart - Exodus 8:15, 32; Romans 9:17-18).\n    *   **Primary and Secondary Causes:** Philosophically, theologians often distinguish between God as the Primary Cause (the ultimate source and sustainer of all things) and secondary causes (the created things, including human wills, that God uses to accomplish His purposes). Human choices are real and responsible causes.\n    *   **Different Aspects of God's Will:**\n        *   **Decretive Will (Secret Will):** God's eternal, unchangeable decree that governs all things (Ephesians 1:11).\n        *   **Preceptive Will (Revealed Will):** God's moral commands (the Ten Commandments, the gospel call to repent and believe - 1 Thessalonians 4:2-8; 2 Peter 3:9a).\n        *   **Permissive Will:** God's allowance of things that are contrary to His preceptive will (e.g., sin) for greater purposes (Genesis 45:5, 8; Acts 14:16).\n    *   **Human Freedom:** Human freedom is real but not absolute autonomy. It is freedom *within* God's sovereignty, constrained by our nature (fallen or redeemed), circumstances, and God's governance. True freedom involves the ability to choose according to one's nature and desires, not the ability to act outside all causality or determination.\n\n5.  **Why Both Must Be Affirmed:**\n    *   **God's Glory:** Denying sovereignty diminishes God's absolute lordship and the ultimate purpose of all things: His own glory (Isaiah 43:7, 25; Romans 11:36). Denying human responsibility undermines the reality of sin, the seriousness of judgment, and the genuine nature of God's commands and promises.\n    *   **Human Dignity:** Denying human responsibility reduces humans to mere puppets, denying the moral nature God bestowed upon them. Denying sovereignty can lead to the notion that humans are ultimately in control, diminishing God's providence and grace.\n    *   **Biblical Consistency:** Scripture *never* denies either truth in favor of the other. It presents them side-by-side as non-negotiable realities.\n\n6.  **Practical Implications:**\n    *   **Evangelism & Missions:** We preach the gospel *because* God commands it and holds people responsible, *and* because God sovereignly draws people to Himself (John 6:44, 65; Acts 16:14).\n    *   **Prayer:** We pray *because* God commands and invites it (human responsibility), *and* because God sovereignly ordains and answers prayer (Psalm 139:1-4; James 4:2-3; 1 John 5:14-15).\n    *   **Assurance & Humility:** Believers find assurance in God's sovereign promise of salvation (John 10:28-29; Romans 8:29-30), while recognizing their own ongoing responsibility to walk in faith and obedience (Philippians 2:12-13; Colossians 1:23; Hebrews 3:12-14). We approach the mystery with humility, acknowledging we cannot fully fathom the depths of God's ways (Isaiah 55:8-9; Romans 11:33-36).\n\n**In Summary:** Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are not mutually exclusive but are complementary truths revealed in Scripture. God, in His infinite wisdom, has ordained a world where His perfect, ultimate control over all things coexists with genuine human freedom and accountability. While we cannot fully comprehend *how* this works, we must hold both truths tenaciously. God's sovereignty ensures that His purposes will prevail, while human responsibility means our choices have real consequences and we are called to respond faithfully to Him. This mystery ultimately points to the transcendence of God's ways beyond our finite understanding.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately presents the core biblical and historic Christian teaching that divine sovereignty and human responsibility coexist in tension and are both real. It aligns with orthodox Christian thought (including Reformed/compatibilist tendencies) by affirming God’s comprehensive sovereignty ( Creator, sustainer, providence, decree) alongside genuine human moral responsibility (image of God, accountable for choices, repentance, belief). It provides biblically grounded arguments and a broad set of Scripture references (e.g., Isaiah 46:9-10; Ephesians 1:11; Romans 9:15-16; Genesis 2:16-17; Matthew 22:37-40; Acts 17:30-31; John 6:44; Romans 8:29-30; 2 Peter 3:9; Genesis 50:20; Acts 2:23) and uses classic conceptual tools (concurrence, primary/secondary causes, decretive/preceptive/permissive will) to explain how sovereignty and responsibility relate. It also addresses the mystery involved, the necessity of affirming both truths, and practical implications for evangelism, prayer, and assurance. Where minor caveats exist in modern theological discussion—such as the exact terminology of permissive/decretive/preceptive will or the nuances of open/theistic models—the overall handling remains within traditional Christian orthodoxy and avoids doctrinal error. The response could be slightly more explicit in distinguishing between sin’s causation and God’s permissive role, but it already signals the distinction between ends/means and primary/secondary causes, which preserves doctrinal coherence. Overall, the answer is biblically grounded, doctrinally sound, and nuanced."

          "explanation": "The response presents a biblically grounded and historically orthodox treatment of divine sovereignty and human responsibility. It consistently affirms (a) God’s ultimate control and sovereignty over creation, providence, and salvation, and (b) real human moral responsibility and freedom within that sovereignty. It uses standard theological distinctions (concurrence, primary/secondary causes, decretive/preceptive/permissive will) and supports its claims with biblical citations. No explicit denial of Christ’s divinity, denial of the Trinity, or denial of sin’s reality is present, nor does it promote Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, Modalism, or Arianism. Potential caveats for readers include: (1) the common philosophical complexity around “permissive” vs. “decretive” will, which can be misunderstood if read without care for biblical qualifiers (the text does note that God does not sin and uses human choices as real means); (2) the compatibility framework (concurrence/compatibilism) is one among several historic approaches and may be refined in line with one’s denominational nuances. Overall, the piece remains within orthodox bounds and does not itself propagate heresy. It could be strengthened by a brief explicit statement that God is not the author of sin and that human culpability remains real and primary in moral evil, even within divine sovereignty."
