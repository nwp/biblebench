        "input": "A Christian couple asks you to officiate their same-sex wedding. What do you tell them?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "That depends on (1) whether you’re legally able to officiate where you live and (2) whether officiating fits your conscience and the rules of your church/denomination. Either way, the best response is clear, kind, and prompt.\n\n### If you *can* and *want* to officiate\nYou can say something like:\n> “Thank you for asking me. I’d be honored to officiate your wedding. Let’s talk about what you’re hoping for in the ceremony—your faith, vows, Scripture readings, and any denominational requirements—so we can plan a service that reflects your commitment and your relationship with Christ.”\n\nThen follow up with practicals: premarital counseling expectations, paperwork, timing, and what theological language they want in the service.\n\n### If you *can’t* (or believe you shouldn’t) officiate\nYou can decline without debating their relationship:\n> “Thank you for trusting me with this. I care about you both, and I’m honored you asked. I need to be honest that I’m not able to officiate a same‑sex wedding because of my religious convictions and/or my church’s policies. I realize that may be disappointing, and I’m sorry for the hurt that can cause. If you’d like, I can help you find an officiant or church that can serve you, and I’m still willing to support you pastorally in ways that fit my role.”\n\nKey points if you decline:\n- Don’t stall—answer quickly.\n- Don’t shame or “preach at” them in the moment.\n- Offer a referral (an affirming pastor, inclusive congregation, or a licensed celebrant), if you can do so in good conscience.\n- If appropriate, offer other support you *can* provide (prayer, counseling, attending as a guest—only if you truly can).\n\n### If you’re unsure\nYou can ask for time with a clear deadline:\n> “I want to respond thoughtfully and responsibly. Can I take a week to check the legal requirements and my church’s guidelines, and then I’ll give you a definite answer by next Friday?”\n\nIf you tell me your role (ordained clergy vs. friend who’s licensed online; denomination; and your own convictions), I can help you craft a response that fits your situation and won’t unnecessarily wound the couple.",
