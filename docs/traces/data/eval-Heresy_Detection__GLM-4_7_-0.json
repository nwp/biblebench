    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.' Is this teaching orthodox or heretical? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "**Verdict:** This teaching is **heresy**.\n\nAs a theologian and church historian, I identify this specific view as a form of **Adoptionism** (also historically known as Dynamic Monarchianism). It stands in direct contradiction to the orthodox Christian understanding of the Person of Jesus Christ as defined by the Ecumenical Councils of Nicaea (325 AD) and Chalcedon (451 AD).\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of why this statement is heretical, categorized by its historical identification and doctrinal errors.\n\n### 1. Historical Identification: Adoptionism\nThe statement that Jesus was a human being \"adopted\" as God’s Son at his baptism (or later) is known as Adoptionism. This view appeared in various forms during the early centuries of the Church.\n*   **Early proponents:** Theodotus the Tanner (late 2nd century) and Paul of Samosata (3rd century) taught versions of this, arguing that Jesus was a man born of the Virgin Mary who was elevated to divine status due to his moral perfection or the indwelling of the Logos (Word) at his baptism.\n*   **Later forms:** It appeared again in the 8th century with Spanish bishops Elipandus of Toledo and Felix of Urgell, and in some modernist theologies.\n*   **Condemnation:** This view was consistently condemned by the early Church Fathers and was formally rejected by the early synods and councils because it undermined the eternal nature of Christ.\n\n### 2. Doctrinal Analysis: Why it is Heresy\nTo understand why this is heresy, one must look at the specific claims made in the statement and compare them to the Rule of Faith (Scripture and Tradition).\n\n**A. The Denial of Eternal Deity (The Pre-existence of Christ)**\n*   **The Statement:** Claims Jesus \"was not truly divine.\"\n*   **Orthodox Teaching:** Orthodoxy affirms that Jesus Christ is the eternal Word (Logos) made flesh. As stated in the Gospel of John: *\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... All things were made through him\"* (John 1:1-3).\n*   **The Error:** Adoptionism teaches that Jesus did not exist as God before his human birth. It reduces Christ to a created creature, implying there was a time when the Son of God did not exist. This denies the doctrine of the Trinity, specifically the eternal generation of the Son.\n\n**B. The Error Regarding the Incarnation**\n*   **The Statement:** Claims he was \"adopted\" at his baptism.\n*   **Orthodox Teaching:** The Incarnation is the union of the divine and human natures in the one Person of Jesus Christ. The Nicene Creed states that Jesus is *\"God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made.\"* He did not *become* God's Son; he has *always been* the Son. The baptism was not the moment of his adoption, but a theophany (a manifestation) of his existing glory and the beginning of his public ministry.\n*   **The Error:** By suggesting Jesus \"became\" divine at a specific moment in time, the statement confuses the *natures* of Christ. It suggests he was merely a man upon whom a special grace or power rested, rather than God who humbled himself to take on human nature (Philippians 2:6-8).\n\n**C. The Inadequacy of \"Prophet and Teacher\"**\n*   **The Statement:** Limits Jesus to being a \"great prophet and teacher.\"\n*   **Orthodox Teaching:** While Jesus is indeed a prophet and teacher (Hebrews 1:1-2), limiting him to these roles denies his role as **Savior**. A mere human prophet cannot atone for the sins of the world (only God can provide an infinite sacrifice), nor can a mere human teacher conquer death through the Resurrection.\n*   **The Error:** This view strips the Gospel of its power. If Jesus is not truly God, his death on the cross is merely the martyrdom of a good man, not the atoning sacrifice that reconciles humanity to the Father.\n\n### 3. The Orthodox Alternative: The Hypostatic Union\nIn response to such heresies, the Church formulated the doctrine of the **Hypostatic Union** at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD). Orthodoxy teaches that Jesus Christ is one person who possesses two distinct natures:\n1.  **Fully Divine:** Consubstantial (homoousios) with the Father, eternal and uncreated.\n2.  **Fully Human:** Consubstantial with us, born of the Virgin Mary, possessing a rational soul and body.\n\nThese two natures are united without confusion, change, division, or separation. Therefore, Jesus did not *become* God at his baptism; rather, at his baptism, the eternal Son of God, who had already taken human flesh, manifested his authority and mission.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement provided is a classic expression of **Adoptionism**. It is heretical because it denies the eternal divinity of Jesus Christ, rejects the doctrine of the Incarnation, and reduces the Second Person of the Trinity to a mere human vessel. Christian orthodoxy demands that we affirm Jesus as *theanthropos*—the God-Man—who is fully God and fully man, united in one Person from the moment of his conception, not from his baptism.",

          "rationale": "The LLM's response accurately identifies Adoptionism as heresy and correctly situates it within historic orthodoxy (eternal Son, two natures, Chalcedonian Christology). It rightly notes that orthodox teaching holds Jesus as the eternal Word who became incarnate, not as a man who becomes divine at baptism, and it explains the issues with restricting Jesus to “prophet and teacher” without his role as Savior. The scriptural grounding (John 1:1; reference to the incarnational doctrine and biblical portrayal of Jesus’ identity) and the doctrinal development (hypostatic union from Chalcedon) are correctly summarized. The response also clarifies that baptism is theointing/manifestation in the public ministry, not the moment of divine adoption. Minor historical caveats (e.g., naming specific councils and the precise chronology of adoptionist controversies) do not undermine the overall accuracy but could be refined for precision. Overall, the assessment is faithful to biblical teaching and historic orthodoxy, capturing key nuances about the Trinity, Christology, and the incarnation. "
