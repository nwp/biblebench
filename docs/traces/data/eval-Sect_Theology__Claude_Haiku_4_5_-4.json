    "expected": "No, this is the ancient heresy of Arianism, condemned at the Council of Nicaea (325 AD). Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is fully God, not a created being. John 1:1 in Greek states 'the Word was God' (theos), not 'a god.' Jesus is eternal (John 8:58, 'before Abraham was, I am'), creator of all things (Colossians 1:16), and worthy of worship equal to the Father (Philippians 2:6, Hebrews 1:6). The JW New World Translation's rendering of John 1:1 as 'the Word was a god' is rejected by Greek scholars as grammatically and theologically inaccurate. The Nicene Creed affirms Jesus as 'God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten not made, of one substance with the Father.'",

            "The label 'Arianism' is a common shorthand for Jehovah's Witness Christology, but some scholars distinguish JW theology as 'nontrinitarian/subordinationist' rather than strict historic Arianism. The response could acknowledge this nuance more carefully.",
            "The claim that JW doctrine reproduces 'Arianism' might overstate the parallel in some details (e.g., JW view of Jesus as Michael the Archangel and the specific understanding of creation). A more precise phrasing would note JW deny the Trinity and hold Jesus as a created, subordinate being, rather than mapping every point directly onto classical Arianism.",
            "Mention of John 1:1 being 'the Word was God' against the JW rendering is accurate in broad scholarly consensus, but the explanation could briefly acknowledge the Greek article/grammar debates more explicitly (definite article in some manuscripts, scholarly discussion about the translation) to be more precise."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer correctly states that Jehovah’s Witness Christology is not orthodox and contrasts it with historic Nicene Christianity. It accurately summarizes key orthodox positions (eternal, uncreated divinity of Christ, homoousios with the Father, Trinity) and JW positions (Jesus as the first creation, a god who is subordinate, not divine by nature). It also notes the historical condemnation of nontrinitarian positions and acknowledges differences in scripture interpretation. The main area for improvement is a more precise handling of the Arian label—modern scholarship often describes JW Christology as nontrinitarian/subordinationist rather than classical Arianism in every detail—and a brief, clearer note on the specific textual/a textual-grammatical issues surrounding John 1:1. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded in its orthodox framing, and nuanced about historical and interpretive differences."
