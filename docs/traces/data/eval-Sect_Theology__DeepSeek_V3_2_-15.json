    "input": "How should Christians respond to people in groups like the LDS church or Jehovah's Witnesses - with hostility or with respect?",
    "expected": "Christians should respond with both truth and love (Ephesians 4:15). This means: (1) Treating individuals with genuine respect, kindness, and dignity as fellow image-bearers of God; (2) Being honest about theological differences without compromise or deception; (3) Recognizing sincere faith and devotion while acknowledging doctrinal error; (4) Avoiding hostility, mockery, or personal attacks; (5) Being willing to build relationships and have respectful conversations; (6) Praying for those in theological error while maintaining clarity about orthodox teaching. Jesus was both gracious to individuals (John 4, woman at the well) and clear about truth (John 8:24, 'you will die in your sins'). We can firmly defend orthodox doctrine while loving our neighbors, including those in non-orthodox groups.",
    "output": "# A Theological and Pastoral Analysis of Christian Response to LDS and Jehovah's Witnesses\n\n## Orthodox Christian Perspective on Other Groups\nFrom an orthodox Christian standpoint (as defined by the historic creeds of Nicaea, Chalcedon, and the Protestant confessions), both The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) and Jehovah's Witnesses depart significantly from essential Christian doctrines:\n\n**Key theological differences:**\n- **Nature of God**: Both groups reject the Trinity as historically understood. LDS theology teaches a form of polytheism with an exalted human God, while Jehovah's Witnesses are strict monotheists who view Jesus as a created being.\n- **Authority of Scripture**: LDS adds additional scriptures (Book of Mormon, etc.); Jehovah's Witnesses use their own translation/interpretation.\n- **Soteriology**: Both have distinct views on salvation that differ from orthodox understandings of grace through faith in Christ's atoning work.\n- **Christology**: Both have non-orthodox views of Christ's nature and pre-existence.\n\n## Biblical and Theological Framework for Response\n\n**1. Theological clarity with charitable engagement**\nChristian scripture calls for both **truth-telling** (Ephesians 4:15, Jude 1:3) and **respectful engagement** (1 Peter 3:15, Colossians 4:6). These are not mutually exclusive.\n\n**2. Rejection of hostility**\nJesus modeled engagement with those with whom he disagreed theologically (Samaritans in John 4, religious leaders in Matthew 23). While he strongly confronted error, he did so with particular individuals in positions of authority, not with generalized hostility toward groups. The Apostle Paul engaged respectfully with Athenian philosophers (Acts 17) while clearly presenting Christian truth.\n\n**3. Distinction between rejecting error and rejecting persons**\nOrthodox Christianity has historically distinguished between heretical teachings and the humanity of those holding them. Augustine's principle, \"With love for humanity and hatred of sins,\" applies here.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\n**With LDS and Jehovah's Witnesses specifically:**\n- **Respect their human dignity and religious freedom** as made in God's image\n- **Understand their beliefs accurately** before engaging (many Christians misunderstand these groups)\n- **Engage with clarity about differences** without compromise of essential Christian doctrines\n- **Prioritize relationship over \"winning\" arguments**—people are not theological projects\n- **Recognize genuine points of contact** (moral values, family commitment, devotion to God as they understand Him)\n- **Distinguish between missionary encounters** (where they initiate contact) and **relational friendships**\n\n**Areas requiring particular pastoral sensitivity:**\n- Family relationships where members belong to different groups\n- The significant sociological and communal aspects of these movements\n- The genuine spiritual seeking often present in members\n\n## Historical Christian Models\nThe early church engaged respectfully with pagan philosophers while clearly articulating Christian distinctives. The Reformers debated theological differences vigorously while (ideally) maintaining civil discourse. Modern evangelical approaches vary from \"counter-cult\" ministries to relational dialogue.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe orthodox Christian response should be neither **hostility** (which violates the command to love neighbors and enemies) nor **uncritical acceptance** (which fails to uphold essential Christian truth). The balanced approach is **respectful engagement**—treating persons with dignity while being clear about theological differences. This reflects both the grace and truth embodied in Christ (John 1:14).\n\nSuch an approach maintains Christian integrity while recognizing the shared humanity and often sincere faith (though misdirected, from an orthodox perspective) of those in these religious movements.",

            "The characterization of Latter-day Saint (LDS) theology as 'polytheism with an exalted human God' is a contested and potentially oversimplified summary. LDS theology broadly rejects the historic Trinity and teaches a distinct Godhead and deification of humanity, but describing it as 'polytheism' can misrepresent the nuanced LDS view of the Godhead and exaltation. A more precise formulation would note: rejection of the Trinity, belief in three distinct beings in the Godhead, and the doctrine of eternal progression leading to divine potential for humans."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately emphasizes that Christians should engage with truth and love, using Scripture to ground the approach (Ephesians 4:15; 1 Peter 3:15; Colossians 4:6; Jude 1:3; John 1:14, John 4, John 8:24). It affirms respecting image-bearing individuals, avoiding hostility, and seeking relational engagement—all in line with orthodox Christian ethics. It correctly identifies major doctrinal differences of LDS and Jehovah’s Witnesses (Trinity, authority of Scripture, Christology, soteriology). The main doctrinal prudence concerns the LDS description; the rest of the analysis aligns well with historic Christian orthodoxy and standard pastoral approaches to non-orthodox groups."
