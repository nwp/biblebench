Tarsus in Cilicia was a prominent Hellenistic city, so he was a Jew raised in a Greek-speaking environment but also fully Jewish in identity.\n- Tribal and ethnic identity: He calls himself “a Hebrew of Hebrews” and identifies his tribal origin as Benjamin (Philippians 3:5; see also Romans 11:1 for Paul’s Jewish self-understanding).\n- Pharisee and legal training: He was a Pharisee and trained “at the feet of Gamaliel” in Jerusalem (Acts 22:3; Acts 5:34–39; see Philippians 3:5–6 for Paul’s own summary — “as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church”).\n- Zeal and persecution of Christians: Before his conversion Paul persecuted the followers of Jesus; he approved the stoning of Stephen and carried out arrests of believers (Acts 7:58–8:3; Galatians 1:13–14).\n- Roman citizenship and Greco-Roman background: He was a Roman citizen (Acts 22:28) — a status that afforded legal protections later used in his mission and trials — and was culturally comfortable in the Greco-Roman world (he used the name Paul in Gentile contexts).\n- Trade and language: Acts calls him a tentmaker (Acts 18:3), indicating a skilled artisan trade he later used to support himself. He almost certainly spoke Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek (and possibly some Latin).\n- Early education and later reflection: Paul’s own letters (especially Galatians and Philippians) and Acts provide the main portrait. Paul’s letters emphasize his strict observance of Jewish law and zealous opposition to the Jesus movement prior to his Damascus road experience (Acts 9; Acts 22; Acts 26).\n\nScholarly notes\n- The broad picture above (Tarsus origin, Pharisaic training under Gamaliel, zealous persecutor, Roman citizen) is the majority/traditional view and is attested in both Acts and Paul’s own letters. Some scholars debate details in Acts (e.g., exact chronology, the nature of his citizenship or the extent of Hellenistic influence), but the core elements are well attested in Paul’s autobiographical statements (Philippians 3:4–6; Galatians 1:13–14) and in Acts.\n\nWhy it matters\nPaul’s combination of rigorous Pharisaic training, Jewish identity, fluency in the Greco-Roman world, and Roman citizenship shaped his theology, mission strategy (bridging Jew and Gentile worlds), rhetorical style, and practical approach to ministry.",

It aligns with Acts (e.g., Acts 22:3; 9:11; 22:28; 23) and Paul’s own letters (e.g., Philippians 3:5–6; Galatians 1:13–14) about his background. It adds well-supported details (tribe Benjamin, tentmaker, languages) and notes scholarly debates about specifics in Acts, which shows appropriate nuance. The only minor caveat is speculative emphasis on Latin, which is not strongly evidenced; however, this is framed as possible rather than asserted as fact. Overall, it directly answers the question and covers essential facts without significant misstatements. "
