    "expected": "The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became human, lived a perfect life, died on the cross as a substitute for sinners, rose from the dead, and now offers salvation and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe in him. It proclaims that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, not earned by human effort, received through faith in Christ alone.",
    "output": "## What is the gospel?\n\n**“Gospel”** means **“good news.”** In the New Testament it is the announcement of what **God has done in Jesus Christ** to save sinners and restore his world. It is not first a self-improvement program or a set of moral rules, but **news**—a message about events, promises, and their meaning.\n\n### 1) The gospel is centered on Jesus Christ—his death and resurrection\nThe New Testament summarizes the gospel most succinctly here:\n\n- **“Christ died for our sins…he was buried…he was raised on the third day.”** (1 Corinthians 15:1–4)\n\nThis is the heart of the gospel: **Jesus’ atoning death and victorious resurrection**.\n\n### 2) The gospel answers a real problem: human sin and God’s judgment\nScripture presents humanity as created good but fallen, guilty, and spiritually dead:\n\n- **All have sinned** (Romans 3:23)  \n- The **wages of sin is death** (Romans 6:23)  \n- God is holy and will judge evil (Romans 2:5–8; Habakkuk 1:13)\n\nIf the gospel is “good news,” it is good because it addresses this bad news honestly: **we need rescue, reconciliation, and forgiveness.**\n\n### 3) The gospel announces God’s saving action: grace through Christ’s substitution\nGod’s love is shown in that Christ died **for us**—in our place—so that sinners can be forgiven and counted righteous:\n\n- **“God shows his love…while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”** (Romans 5:8)  \n- **“He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree.”** (1 Peter 2:24)  \n- **“For our sake he made him to be sin…so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.”** (2 Corinthians 5:21)\n\nAt the cross, God does not ignore sin; he **deals with it**—satisfying justice and extending mercy.\n\n### 4) The gospel is received by repentance and faith, not by works\nThe gospel calls for a response:\n\n- **Repent** (turn from sin and self-rule) and **believe** (trust Christ) (Mark 1:15)  \n- We are **justified by faith** apart from works (Romans 3:28)  \n- Salvation is **by grace…through faith…not a result of works** (Ephesians 2:8–9)\n\nGood works matter, but they are the **fruit** of salvation, not the **basis** of it (Ephesians 2:10).\n\n### 5) The gospel creates a new people and a new life under Jesus’ lordship\nThe gospel includes Christ’s reign and the formation of a redeemed community:\n\n- Jesus proclaimed **the kingdom of God** (Mark 1:14–15)  \n- The gospel brings **reconciliation** to God and to one another (Ephesians 2:13–19)  \n- Those who believe receive the **Holy Spirit**, are adopted, and begin a transformed life (Romans 8:1–17; Titus 3:4–7)\n\n### 6) The gospel has a future: resurrection, renewal, and final restoration\nThe good news culminates in God’s final victory:\n\n- Because Christ is raised, believers will be raised (1 Corinthians 15:20–23)  \n- God will make **all things new** (Revelation 21:1–5)\n\n---\n\n## A concise biblical definition\n**The gospel is the good news that the holy God has fulfilled his promises by sending his Son, Jesus Christ, who died for our sins and rose again, so that all who repent and believe are forgiven, justified, reconciled to God, receive the Spirit, and inherit eternal life in God’s kingdom.**\n\nIf you’d like, I can also summarize the gospel in one paragraph suitable for evangelism, or distinguish “the gospel” from related ideas like “kingdom,” “justification,” and “salvation.”",

It cites key passages (e.g., 1 Cor 15:1–4, Rom 3:23; 6:23, Rom 5:8; 2 Cor 5:21; Eph 2:8–9; Rom 8:1–17; Rev 21:1–5) and presents a coherent, covenantal, and eschatological view of the gospel, including its corporate dimension (reconciliation, the church) and its future consummation. Minor caveats: the answer could more explicitly state the incarnation and Christ’s sinless life as foundational gospel premises, and explicitly foreground salvation in Christ alone. Nevertheless, the core content is faithful, doctrinally sound, and nuanced (already/not yet, kingdom, justification, grace, and response of faith)."

          "explanation": "The response presents a standard evangelical/orthodox definition of the gospel. It centers on Christ’s atoning death and resurrection, human sin and God’s judgment, grace through faith (not works), reversal of life through the Spirit, and a future resurrection. It affirms substitutionary atonement and justification by faith, with salvation as a gift of grace. There is no explicit denial of orthodox doctrines (such as the Trinity and the deity of Christ) or adoption of non-biblical heresies. Minor clarifications (e.g., explicit Trinitarian language) could be added, but none of the content constitutes heresy."
