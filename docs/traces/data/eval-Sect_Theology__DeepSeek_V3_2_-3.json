    "expected": "LDS theology teaches that Jesus and Lucifer (Satan) are spirit brothers, both created by God the Father in a pre-mortal existence. This is incompatible with orthodox Christianity for several reasons: (1) Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17 says all things were created through him); (2) Jesus is worshiped as God (Hebrews 1:6) while Satan is a fallen angel; (3) This teaching diminishes Christ's unique divine nature and blurs the absolute distinction between the Creator and creation. Orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus as the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity, while Satan is a created angelic being who rebelled.",
    "output": "## Analysis of Latter-day Saint Teachings on Jesus and Lucifer\n\n### Latter-day Saint (LDS) Teaching\nIn Latter-day Saint theology, Jesus and Lucifer are understood as **spirit brothers**, both being pre-mortal spirit children of Heavenly Father (God) and a Heavenly Mother. Key aspects include:\n1. **Pre-mortal existence**: All humans existed as spirits before earthly life, with Jesus and Lucifer among them.\n2. **Council in Heaven**: God presented a plan for humanity's salvation. **Jesus** proposed a plan emphasizing human agency and offering himself as Savior. **Lucifer** proposed compelling obedience and sought God's glory for himself.\n3. **Different destinies**: Jesus was chosen as Savior, while Lucifer rebelled, leading one-third of the spirits to follow him, becoming the devil and his angels.\n4. **Ontological similarity**: Both are seen as divine offspring of God, though Jesus is the firstborn and \"only begotten\" in the flesh.\n\n### Orthodox Christian Perspective\nFrom historic Christian orthodoxy (as defined by Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant traditions), several fundamental conflicts exist:\n\n#### **1. Nature of God**\n- **Orthodoxy**: God is **eternally triune** – one Being in three co-equal, co-eternal Persons. There is no ontological \"Heavenly Mother\" or sexual procreation within the Godhead.\n- **Conflict**: LDS theology presents a **radically different metaphysic** where God is an exalted man from another world, and divinity is achieved rather than eternally self-existent.\n\n#### **2. Nature of Christ**\n- **Orthodoxy**: Jesus is **eternally begotten** of the Father, **uncreated**, **consubstantial** with the Father, and the **sole divine Son**. All other beings are creatures.\n- **Conflict**: Viewing Jesus as Lucifer's brother makes Christ a **created being** rather than the eternal Creator—classified as **Arianism** or **subordinationism**, condemned as heresy at the Council of Nicaea (325 AD).\n\n#### **3. Nature of Satan**\n- **Orthodoxy**: Lucifer/Satan is a **created angelic being** who fell through pride. Angels and humans are distinct creations; no angel is spiritually \"kin\" to God in a familial sense.\n- **Conflict**: Making Satan God's spirit-child elevates his ontological status while diminishing God's transcendence.\n\n#### **4. Plan of Salvation**\n- **Orthodoxy**: Salvation is by grace through faith in Christ's **finished atoning work**, not the implementation of a pre-mortal choice between plans.\n- **Conflict**: The LDS \"War in Heaven\" narrative frames earthly life as a continuation of a cosmic conflict where human obedience validates Jesus' plan over Lucifer's.\n\n### Areas of Superficial Agreement\nBoth traditions agree that:\n- Jesus is the divine Savior\n- Lucifer is a real, evil being\n- There was a pre-temporal rebellion\n- Jesus' obedience contrasts with Lucifer's rebellion\n\n### Fundamental Departures\nThe core conflict is **ontological**: Orthodox Christianity maintains a **Creator-creature distinction**, while LDS theology teaches a **continuum of being** where God, humans, Jesus, and Lucifer all belong to the same species at different stages of exaltation.\n\nThis LDS teaching is problematic from an orthodox perspective because:\n1. **Denies divine aseity**: God is not self-existent but part of an infinite regression of gods.\n2. **Demotes Christ**: Makes Jesus a created being rather than the eternal Word (John 1:1).\n3. **Re-defines sin and salvation**: The fall becomes a calculated step in cosmic progression rather than a tragic rebellion against the Creator.\n4. **Contradicts ecumenical creeds**: Explicitly rejects the Nicene Creed's \"begotten, not made\" and \"true God from true God.\"\n\n### Respectful Conclusion\nWhile Latter-day Saints and orthodox Christians share terminology like \"Jesus Christ,\" \"Savior,\" and \"atonement,\" they mean **radically different things** by these terms. The LDS view of Jesus and Lucifer as brothers flows from a fundamentally different understanding of God, creation, and reality itself—one that orthodox Christianity considers **incompatible with biblical revelation** as understood historically. This represents not merely different interpretations but **different religions** with different foundational premises.",

            "The statement that Jesus and Lucifer are \"created by God the Father in a pre-mortal existence\" is a misleading simplification of LDS anthropology. In LDS theology, Jesus is the eternal (begotten) Son and not simply a created being; pre-mortal existence involves spirit offspring, not a generic act of creation for Jesus and Lucifer as “two created beings.”",
            "Lucifer described as a \"fallen angel\". In LDS teaching, Lucifer is a pre-mortal spirit and rebel; the common biblical category of angels is not a perfect fit for Mormon anthropology, so labeling him purely as a \"fallen angel\" can mislead readers about the LDS metaphysical framework.",
            "Heavenly Mother phrasing. The text invokes a Heavenly Mother as part of LDS ontology. While many LDS sources acknowledge talk of a Heavenly Mother, it is not an official, universally codified doctrine in the way the text suggests, and treating it as a standard premise risks overgeneralization.",
            "The shorthand equating LDS views with classic heresies (e.g., \"Arianism\" or \"subordinationism\") can oversimplify the disagreement. LDS Christology is not simply a straightforward instance of those ancient heresies; it represents a distinct, nontrinitarian framework that critics often label differently. The phrasing may blur the specific doctrinal divergence between Trinitarian orthodoxy and Mormon theological claims.",
            "Some phrasing implies a broader, almost inevitable ecumenical consequence (\"not merely different interpretations but different religions\"). While many would argue LDS and historic Christian orthodoxy are incompatible, presenting them as two separate religions is a contested evaluative claim rather than a strictly doctrinal one."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is largely faithful to orthodox critiques and cites key scriptural anchors for the orthodox position (e.g., John 1:1-3; Colossians 1:16-17; Hebrews 1:6). However, it contains some doctrinally sensitive simplifications about Mormon theology (e.g., Jesus and Lucifer as mere \"created beings\" in a pre-mortal existence; the frequent use of \"fallen angel\" for Lucifer; the asserted universality of Heavenly Mother doctrine) that can misrepresent LDS teaching. It also risks overgeneralizing LDS-orthodox differences as two separate religions. Overall, the core critique is sound, but the presentation of several LDS specifics should be more nuanced to avoid mischaracterization."
