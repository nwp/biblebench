It captures the main contrast and aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy and biblical grounding. Nuances it could improve include noting that Kings also contains prophetic voices and that Chronicles emphasizes Levitical/Worship concerns in addition to Davidic lineage; the dating of Chronicles to the post-exilic Persian period is widely accepted but debated among scholars."
