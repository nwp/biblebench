    "expected": "Christians should respond with both truth and love (Ephesians 4:15). This means: (1) Treating individuals with genuine respect, kindness, and dignity as fellow image-bearers of God; (2) Being honest about theological differences without compromise or deception; (3) Recognizing sincere faith and devotion while acknowledging doctrinal error; (4) Avoiding hostility, mockery, or personal attacks; (5) Being willing to build relationships and have respectful conversations; (6) Praying for those in theological error while maintaining clarity about orthodox teaching. Jesus was both gracious to individuals (John 4, woman at the well) and clear about truth (John 8:24, 'you will die in your sins'). We can firmly defend orthodox doctrine while loving our neighbors, including those in non-orthodox groups.",

It correctly emphasizes the image of God in all people, commands to love, and the necessity of gentleness and respect in defending orthodox doctrine. It acknowledges significant doctrinal differences with groups like the LDS and Jehovah's Witnesses (e.g., Trinity, Christology, additional scriptures) without endorsing hostility toward individuals. It uses appropriate biblical exemplars (John 4, John 8:24; Colossians 4:6) and highlights that truth and love are complementary. The nuance is solid: it distinguishes doctrinal disagreement from personal hostility and advocates relationship-building and prayer. A minor enhancement could include an explicit brief directive to share the gospel and to avoid caricature or misrepresentation, but the core guidance is biblically sound and orthodox."
