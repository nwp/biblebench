    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",
    "output": "Below, I'll explain the theological differences between charismatic/Pentecostal Christians and cessationist Christians regarding spiritual gifts. As a fair-minded theologian, I'll represent these perspectives accurately based on their historical, biblical, and denominational foundations, drawing from key thinkers and traditions. I'll avoid bias by presenting both views as legitimate expressions within the broader Christian faith, while noting their shared commitment to core orthodox beliefs (e.g., the Trinity, the deity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, and the authority of Scripture). These differences reflect diverse interpretations of the Bible and church history, and respectful dialogue between these groups has enriched Christian theology.\n\n### Background on Spiritual Gifts in Christianity\nSpiritual gifts (often called *charismata* in Greek) are abilities or empowerments given by the Holy Spirit to believers for the building up of the church and the advancement of God's kingdom. They are described in several New Testament passages, including Romans 12:6-8, 1 Corinthians 12:4-11, and Ephesians 4:11-13. Common gifts include teaching, serving, prophecy, healing, miracles, speaking in tongues (glossolalia), interpretation of tongues, discernment of spirits, apostleship, evangelism, and administration.\n\nThe debate centers on whether all these gifts—especially the more \"miraculous\" or \"sign\" gifts like tongues, prophecy, healing, and miracles—continue to operate in the church today as they did in the apostolic era (the time of Jesus' apostles in the first century). This is not a debate about the Holy Spirit's ongoing work in general (both sides affirm His role in conviction, sanctification, and guidance), but about the specific manifestation and availability of certain gifts.\n\n### Charismatic/Pentecostal Perspective\nCharismatic and Pentecostal Christians (often overlapping but with slight distinctions—Pentecostals emphasize a post-conversion \"baptism in the Holy Spirit\" evidenced by speaking in tongues, while charismatics may be found in mainline denominations like Catholicism or Anglicanism) believe in the **continuation** of all spiritual gifts throughout the church age. This view, sometimes called \"continuationism,\" emerged prominently in the early 20th-century Pentecostal revival (e.g., the Azusa Street Revival in 1906) and has influenced movements like the Charismatic Renewal in the 1960s-70s.\n\n- **Key Beliefs:**\n  - All gifts listed in the New Testament are available today and should be actively sought and exercised by believers. This includes \"sign gifts\" like tongues (a prayer language or unknown language for edification), prophecy (Spirit-inspired messages for encouragement or guidance), healing (supernatural physical or emotional restoration), and miracles (acts defying natural laws).\n  - The Holy Spirit empowers believers for mission and worship in dynamic, experiential ways. Baptism in the Holy Spirit is often seen as a distinct experience from conversion, leading to greater boldness and gifting.\n  - Gifts are for the edification of the church (1 Corinthians 14:26) and evangelism (e.g., healings as signs pointing to the gospel, as in Acts 3:1-10).\n\n- **Biblical Basis:**\n  - They point to the ongoing nature of the church's mission in passages like Acts 2:17-18 (quoting Joel's prophecy of the Spirit being poured out \"in the last days,\" which they see as the entire period from Pentecost to Christ's return).\n  - Jesus' promise in Mark 16:17-18 that believers will perform signs, and Paul's encouragement in 1 Corinthians 14:1 to \"eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy.\"\n  - They interpret 1 Corinthians 13:8-10 (which says gifts like prophecy and tongues will cease \"when completeness comes\") as referring to Christ's second coming, not the completion of the Bible.\n\n- **Practical Implications:**\n  - Worship services often include spontaneous expressions of gifts, such as prophetic words, healing prayers, or speaking/interpreting tongues. Denominations like the Assemblies of God, Foursquare Church, or Vineyard Movement emphasize this, and charismatics in other traditions (e.g., Catholic Charismatic Renewal) integrate it into liturgy.\n  - There's a strong emphasis on personal experiences of the Holy Spirit, balanced by calls for discernment to avoid abuse (e.g., testing prophecies against Scripture, per 1 Thessalonians 5:19-21).\n\nProminent thinkers include early Pentecostal leaders like William Seymour and modern theologians like Wayne Grudem (a Reformed charismatic) or Jack Deere, who argue that limiting gifts contradicts the Bible's portrayal of an active, empowering Spirit.\n\n### Cessationist Perspective\nCessationist Christians believe that certain miraculous or revelatory gifts (e.g., apostleship, prophecy, tongues, healing, and miracles) **ceased** after the apostolic age, typically with the death of the last apostles or the completion of the New Testament canon around the 4th century. This view is common in Reformed, Baptist, and some evangelical traditions, rooted in the Protestant Reformation and influenced by figures like John Calvin and B.B. Warfield.\n\n- **Key Beliefs:**\n  - The \"sign gifts\" were temporary, given primarily to authenticate the apostles' message and establish the early church during a foundational period (Hebrews 2:3-4). Once the foundation was laid (Ephesians 2:20), these gifts were no longer necessary.\n  - Non-miraculous gifts (e.g., teaching, mercy, administration) continue today, as they are essential for the church's ongoing function. God can still perform miracles sovereignly (e.g., through prayer), but not through gifted individuals as in the New Testament.\n  - The focus is on the sufficiency of Scripture (sola scriptura) for guidance, rather than new revelations via prophecy or tongues, to avoid adding to or contradicting the Bible.\n\n- **Biblical Basis:**\n  - They interpret 1 Corinthians 13:8-10 as indicating that gifts like prophecy and tongues cease when \"completeness\" (or \"perfection\") arrives, which they see as the completion of the biblical canon—providing a mature, sufficient revelation.\n  - Ephesians 2:20 describes the church as built on the foundation of apostles and prophets, implying these roles were unique to the early church.\n  - Historical arguments note a decline in miraculous gifts after the apostolic era, as observed by early church fathers like Augustine (who later affirmed some miracles) and supported by the relative scarcity in post-apostolic writings.\n\n- **Practical Implications:**\n  - Worship and ministry emphasize preaching, teaching, and service based on Scripture, with less focus on experiential or supernatural manifestations. Denominations like many Presbyterian (e.g., PCA), Reformed Baptist, or dispensational groups (e.g., some in the Southern Baptist Convention) hold this view.\n  - Prayer for healing is encouraged, but it's seen as God's direct intervention rather than a gift exercised by believers. Cessationists caution against excesses in charismatic practices that could lead to emotionalism or false teachings.\n\nInfluential voices include John Calvin (who saw miracles as confirming the gospel in the early church), B.B. Warfield (whose book *Counterfeit Miracles* argued for cessation based on history), and modern theologians like John MacArthur or Tom Schreiner.\n\n### Key Differences and Common Ground\n- **Core Difference:** Charismatics/Pentecostals see spiritual gifts as fully operative today, encouraging their pursuit for empowerment and edification, while cessationists view the miraculous gifts as having fulfilled their purpose and ceased, emphasizing Scripture's sufficiency.\n- **Points of Tension:** Debates often arise over interpretations of Scripture (e.g., the meaning of \"completeness\" in 1 Corinthians 13) and experiences (e.g., whether modern tongues or prophecies align with biblical descriptions). Cessationists may critique charismatic practices as potentially subjective or divisive, while charismatics may see cessationism as quenching the Spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:19).\n- **Shared Commitments:** Both affirm the Holy Spirit as the third person of the Trinity, active in believers' lives. They agree on the gifts' purpose (building the church) and the need for order (1 Corinthians 14:40). Many in both camps engage in ecumenical dialogue, recognizing these as secondary issues not affecting salvation. For instance, figures like John Piper (a continuationist in a Reformed tradition) and R.C. Sproul (a cessationist) have modeled respectful disagreement.\n\nIn summary, these views represent a rich diversity in how Christians understand the Holy Spirit's work, shaped by Scripture, history, and experience. If you'd like to explore specific Bible passages, historical examples, or how these views play out in particular denominations, I'm happy to elaborate further while maintaining balance and respect.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response provides a balanced, largely accurate overview of both continuations (charismatic/Pentecostal) and cessationist positions. It correctly describes core commitments: continuationists affirm ongoing charismatic gifts (tongues, prophecy, healing, miracles) and emphasize experiential worship and Spirit empowerment; cessationists hold that sign gifts ceased after the apostolic era (often tying this to the completion of the NT canon) while affirming non-miraculous gifts (teaching, service, mercy) continue. Biblical references (Acts 2:17-18; Mark 16:17-18; 1 Corinthians 13:8-10; 1 Thessalonians 5:19-21; Ephesians 2:20) are invoked in a representative way, and the distinction between ongoing Spirit activity and the particular gifts’ manifestations is well maintained. The response also notes shared orthodox commitments (Trinity, the deity of Christ, salvation by grace) and the importance of discernment, order, and humility in dialogue, which aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy and ecumenical prudence. Nuances are present (e.g., the contested interpretation of “perfect/completeness” in 1 Corinthians 13; noting what counts as “sign gifts”; mentioning canonical completion around the 4th century). The main potential gap is the lack of explicit discussion of the range of cessationist views (hard vs soft/partial cessationism) and the spectrum within continuationism (e.g., varieties of prophetic ministry, cessationist openness to miracles outside a gift-based framework). Including those finer distinctions would enhance nuance, but the core theological and biblical portrayals are sound and balanced."
