    "input": "Who has final authority in interpreting Scripture: the individual believer, church leaders, denominational traditions, or ecumenical councils?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Short answer: Christians disagree. Most would agree Scripture itself is the final normative standard (what the Bible says is decisive), but traditions differ about who has the final word in determining what Scripture means in contested cases. How that final interpretive authority is exercised — by the individual conscience guided by the Spirit, by pastors and bishops, by denominational creeds and courts, or by councils — is the crux of the dispute.\n\nWhat the Bible itself contributes\n- 2 Timothy 3:16–17 presents Scripture as God‑breathed and useful for teaching, reproof, correction and training in righteousness — giving it ultimate normative weight.\n- John 16:12–15 and Acts 8–9 suggest the Spirit’s role in guiding believers into truth.\n- Acts 15 (the Jerusalem council) and Matthew 16:18–19/Matt 18:15–20 show that communal/authoritative decision‑making in the church has biblical precedent.\n- 1 Peter 2:9 and passages about the “priesthood of all believers” indicate believers have direct access to God and a role in reading Scripture (cf. Acts 17:11 — the Bereans “examined the Scriptures”).\n\nHow major Christian traditions answer\n- Roman Catholic: The Magisterium (pope and bishops in council) interprets Scripture authoritatively within the living Tradition. Scripture and Tradition together form the deposit of faith; councils and the pope exercise a final teaching office (cf. Dei Verbum).\n- Eastern Orthodox: Emphasizes the church’s living Tradition and conciliar life. Ecumenical councils and the consensus of the Church Fathers (the “catena”) are decisive; interpretation happens within the liturgical and sacramental life of the Church.\n- Protestant (broadly): Uphold sola scriptura — Scripture alone as final authority. Yet there is diversity within Protestantism:\n  - Some evangelical and Reformed churches stress the primacy of Scripture but accept confessions and creeds as authoritative guides for interpretation.\n  - Lutheran and Reformed traditions give strong weight to historic creeds and confessions as faithful summaries of biblical teaching.\n  - Many Protestants affirm the “priesthood of all believers,” which can foster more decentralized interpretation; others insist private interpretation must be tested by the church community.\n- Anglicanism and some others: “Scripture, Tradition, and Reason” (or Scripture and tradition in conversation) — no single human office monopolizes interpretation; bishops and councils have authority, but historic formularies and reason shape understanding.\n- Pentecostal/charismatic: Emphasize the Spirit’s contemporary guidance and individual experience in interpretation, but most seek consistency with Scripture and accountability to community leaders.\n\nPractical and theological considerations\n- Individual reading without accountability can lead to idiosyncrasy and error; the New Testament repeatedly presumes ordered teaching, elders, and testing (1 Corinthians 14:29; Hebrews 13:7,17).\n- An overly centralized claim to final interpretation can become authoritarian and risk making tradition unaccountable to Scripture.\n- Historical consensus (creeds, early councils) is a helpful interpretive guardrail; many Protestants accept the first four ecumenical councils because they reflect and protect biblical faith.\n- The Holy Spirit’s role is essential: true interpretation requires prayer, humility, and the Spirit’s illumination, not merely technique or authority.\n\nA constructive way to think about “final authority”\n- Normative: Scripture is the final norm — what Christians measure doctrine and practice against (the Reformers’ insight).\n- Interpretive authority: Scripture is not self‑interpreting in isolation; interpretation is done within a community shaped by the Spirit, with roles for teachers, pastors, councils, creeds, and reason.\n- Institutional expression differs: Roman Catholics and Orthodox give decisive institutional authority to Magisterium/conciliar tradition; many Protestants vest interpretive authority in Scripture itself mediated through pastors, confessions, and the believing community; evangelicals and charismatics emphasize Spirit and conscience while acknowledging community accountability.\n\nIf you want a practical rule of thumb\n- Test interpretations by Scripture itself (Scripture interprets Scripture), historic creeds and the consensus of the early church, sound exegesis (historical‑grammatical method), and the fruits of the Spirit (Matthew 7:15–20; Galatians 5:22–23). Be humble, accountable, and willing to submit private readings to communal correction.\n\nConclusion\nThere is no single answer accepted by all Christians. Theologically careful Christians will insist that Scripture is the ultimate standard, while also affirming that faithful interpretation normally happens in and through the believing community — whether that community’s final arbiter is a council, a teaching office, denominational confessions, or an informed, Spirit‑led congregation depends on one’s tradition.",

It emphasizes humility, Spirit-led interpretation, and communal oversight rather than an absolute, centralized authority, which reflects a traditional emphasis on biblical authority but with openness to differing institutional forms. This places it between moderate and conservative, leaning conservative due to strong emphasis on biblical authority and traditional safeguards, yet moderate in acknowledging multiple legitimate approaches.",
