    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "Excellent. As a theologian, I will analyze the Latter-day Saint (LDS) teaching—commonly known as the \"Law of Eternal Progression\" or Lorenzo Snow's couplet—with respect to its relationship to orthodox (historic, creedal) Christian theology.\n\n### **Analysis of the Teaching: \"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become.\"**\n\nThis statement is a succinct summary of a core LDS doctrine concerning the nature of God and humanity's ultimate potential. It implies several key theological points:\n1.  **God's Ontological History:** God the Father was once a mortal man who progressed to deity.\n2.  **Human Ontological Destiny:** Faithful humans have the potential to progress to become gods of their own worlds, participating in the same kind of divinity as God the Father.\n3.  **A Relational Ontology:** God and humanity are of the same *species*, differing in degree of glory and experience, not in fundamental nature. This is often described in LDS thought as \"exalted man.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Comparison with Orthodox Christian Theology**\n\nOrthodox Christian theology, as defined by the ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Athanasian) and the consensus of the early Church Fathers across Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant traditions, presents a fundamentally different understanding of God and humanity. Here is a point-by-point comparison:\n\n#### **1. On the Nature of God (Theology Proper)**\n*   **Orthodox View:** God is *aseity* (from Latin *a se*, \"from himself\"). He is uncreated, eternal, without beginning or end, self-existent, and the source of all else that exists (Isaiah 43:10; Psalm 90:2; John 5:26). God's nature is *immutable* (unchanging) in His being and perfections (Malachi 3:6; James 1:17). The Nicene Creed defines God the Father as \"Maker of heaven and earth\" and the Son as \"begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father.\" God is categorically distinct from creation.\n*   **LDS View (in the couplet):** God the Father is an exalted man who progressed from a prior state of existence. He is not eternal in the sense of being \"without beginning,\" but is eternally existent in the sense of unending duration *after* His own exaltation.\n*   **Area of Departure:** This is a **profound and fundamental departure**. The orthodox doctrine of God's *aseity* and *eternality* is non-negotiable. The LDS teaching directly contradicts it by presenting God as a being who underwent a process of becoming within a cosmic cycle. In orthodox terms, this would be classified as a form of **polytheism** (belief in many gods) and **heterodoxy** at best, more often as a different theological system altogether.\n\n#### **2. On the Nature of Humanity and Salvation (Anthropology & Soteriology)**\n*   **Orthodox View:** Humans are created beings, made in the *image* and *likeness* of God (Genesis 1:26-27). The goal of salvation is **theosis** (deification/divinization), understood as becoming \"partakers of the divine nature\" (2 Peter 1:4) through grace and union with Christ. This is a transformative participation in God's energies (His life, love, glory) through adoption, **but it never means becoming ontologically identical to God or ceasing to be creatures**. The creature-Creator distinction is eternally preserved. The saved will be glorified, perfected, and enjoy eternal communion with God, but they do not become separate gods or creators of their own universes.\n*   **LDS View (in the couplet):** Humanity has the potential for **exaltation** to become gods in the fullest sense—possessing all of God's attributes, powers, and roles, including eternal increase and creation. This is an ontological progression into the same class of being as God.\n*   **Area of Departure:** While both traditions use the language of \"divinization,\" they mean radically different things. Orthodoxy sees deification as **participation in God** while eternally remaining His creation. The LDS doctrine sees exaltation as **equality with God** in nature and function. This, combined with the view of God's own progression, creates a cosmology of eternal regression of gods, which is entirely absent from orthodox thought.\n\n#### **3. On the Uniqueness of Christ (Christology)**\n*   **Orthodox View:** Jesus Christ is the **eternally begotten Son**, the Second Person of the Trinity, incarnate. He is fully God and fully man, the one and only mediator between God and humanity (1 Timothy 2:5). His incarnation, atonement, and resurrection are unique, once-for-all events.\n*   **LDS View:** While also revering Jesus as the Savior and Jehovah of the Old Testament, LDS theology typically sees Christ as the firstborn spirit child of Heavenly Parents and a separate being from the Father. His path is the pattern for the exaltation of others.\n*   **Area of Departure:** The orthodox doctrine of the Trinity (one God in three co-eternal, co-equal Persons) is incompatible with the LDS view of a plurality of separate gods. Christ's role as the *unique* God-man is re-contextualized in LDS thought as the first and greatest example of a broader law of progression.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe LDS teaching, **\"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become,\" is fundamentally inconsistent with orthodox Christian theology.** It departs from orthodoxy on the most foundational levels: the nature of God (*aseity* vs. progression), the nature of humanity and salvation (glorified creature vs. potential god), and the structure of divine reality (Trinitarian monotheism vs. a form of polytheistic henotheism).\n\nWhile both traditions share surface-level vocabulary (God, salvation, exaltation/deification), they assign radically different meanings to these terms. From an orthodox perspective, the LDS couplet describes a different God, a different human destiny, and a different cosmic story. It is therefore not a minor doctrinal variance but a difference that places the two faiths in separate theological categories.\n\n**A respectful note on analysis:** A fair analysis requires understanding this teaching within its own LDS context, where it is a powerful statement of hope and eternal potential. However, when measured against the historical, creedal standards of Christianity that have defined the faith for nearly two millennia, it represents a significant and systematic departure.",

            "The response labels the LDS claim as 'polytheism' in a way that may oversimplify ongoing scholarly debate; many theologians describe LDS belief as non-Trinitarian and often framed as monotheism with exaltation rather than outright polytheism, or as a form of henotheism/monolatry depending on the grid used. this nuance is important for precision."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer accurately aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy: God’s aseity, eternality, and Creator-creature distinction; theosis as participation in divine life without ontological equality with God; and the orthodox critique of the LDS claim that God was once mortal and that humans can become gods. It also correctly notes Christology differences and the non-creedal status of LDS theology. The main caveat is a nuanced point about the label 'polytheism': some scholars would classify LDS theology as non-Trinitarian and distinct from classical polytheism or could describe it as monotheistic with exalted beings, depending on the framework. Overall, the analysis is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced regarding major theological distinctions."
