These are solidly grounded in Scripture (e.g., Christ’s victory in Revelation 19–22, judgments in Revelation 6–16, perseverance and reward in the letters to the churches, and the overarching sovereignty of God). It aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy that Revelation serves to encourage steadfast faith amid persecution and to anticipate Christ’s return and the consummation of God’s kingdom. A slightly more nuanced answer would explicitly mention the blessings and exhortations to endure found in the text (e.g., the blessing on readers in 1:3 and the call to perseverance in 2–3) and acknowledge the apocalyptic, symbolic genre, but these are not doctrinal errors."
