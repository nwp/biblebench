    "input": "Explain justification by faith. How does someone become righteous before God?",
    "expected": "Justification by faith is the doctrine that sinners are declared righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus Christ, not by their own works or merit. It is a legal declaration by God where the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, and their sins are forgiven. This justification is received through faith alone (sola fide), by grace alone (sola gratia), based on Christ's finished work alone (solus Christus).",
    "output": "Here is a clear, biblically grounded explanation of justification by faith and how a person becomes righteous before God.\n\n1) What justification by faith means\n- Forensic declaration: Justification is God’s legal declaration that a person is righteous in His sight. It is not primarily a change in a person’s inner feelings or a moral makeover at that moment, but a verdict: “You are righteous,” on the basis of Christ’s righteousness.\n- Ground and instrument: The ground of this declaration is the righteousness of Jesus Christ and His atoning work on the cross (His perfect obedience and His sacrificial death). The means by which God applies that righteousness to a person is faith—trusting in Christ and receiving Him as Lord and Savior.\n- Not by works: Justification is by grace alone and not by human merit or works. It is God’s gift, received through faith (not earned by anything we do). This does not deny the necessity of repentance or change, but it denies that moral achievements or adherence to the law can earn one a righteous standing before God.\n\n2) Biblical foundations\n- Romans 3:21-28 emphasizes that a righteousness from God has been manifested apart from the law, and that justification is received by faith in Jesus Christ.\n- Romans 4 uses Abraham as a model: faith was counted/credited as righteousness before circumcision and before law-keeping, showing that justification is by faith, not by works of the law.\n- Galatians 2-3oppose justification by the works of the law and insist that “the just shall live by faith” (3:11, 2:16).\n- Ephesians 2:8-9: salvation is by grace through faith, and not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\n- Philippians 3:9 and Romans 3:24-25 also speak of righteousness from God that comes through faith in Christ.\n- 2 Corinthians 5:21 and Romans 5:17 describe the relational outcome of justification: believers are declared righteous on the basis of Christ’s righteousness and receive spiritual blessing and access to God.\n\n3) How someone becomes righteous before God\n- The problem: All humans have sinned and fall short of God’s standard (Romans 3:23). The penalty for sin is separation from God (Romans 6:23).\n- God’s provision: God provided a righteousness “outside” of us—Christ’s own obedience and atoning death. Jesus bore the penalty for sin and earned the rightful, perfect righteousness required by God.\n- The human response: God calls people to repent (turn from sin) and to trust—have faith—in Jesus Christ: believing that He died for sins, rose again, and is Lord (Acts 16:31; Romans 10:9-10).\n- Faith as the instrument: Faith is the means by which individuals receive Christ’s righteousness. Faith itself is not a merit; it is trust and reliance on Christ. The believer is united to Christ by faith, so Christ’s righteousness is reckoned to the believer (imputed) and sins are forgiven (Rom 4:6-8; Rom 3:22-26).\n- The result: At the moment one believes, God declares the believing sinner righteous, acquits them, and grants new standing before Him—peace with God and access to His grace (Romans 5:1-2). This declaration is what we mean by justification.\n\n4) Key theological concepts often discussed with justification\n- Imputed righteousness: Christ’s righteousness is credited to the believer. The believer’s sins are counted as charged to Christ, and Christ’s righteousness is counted to the believer (double imputation). This underwrites the forensic nature of justification.\n- Union with Christ: The believer’s justification is inseparably bound to being “in Christ.” To be reconciled to God is to be united to Christ, so that what is true of Christ becomes true of the believer (2 Cor 5:17-21; Rom 6:3-5; Rom 8:1).\n- Ground of the claim vs. the fruit of the claim: The ground of justification is Christ’s righteousness and His death, not the believer’s own moral improvement. The new life that follows—sanctification—flows from that new standing and the Spirit's work in the believer (Eph 2:10; Rom 8:29-30).\n- Faith as instrument, not merit: Faith itself is the means by which one receives Christ’s righteousness. It is trust, obedience, and reliance on Jesus, not a personal merit that earns justification.\n\n5) Relationship to sanctification\n- They are related but distinct: Justification is a change in status before God; sanctification is the ongoing transformation of the person’s character and conduct. Both are the work of grace in the life of the believer.\n- They often occur together in the life of the church: justification provides the basis for assurance and relationship with God; sanctification provides evidence of true faith and grows the believer in righteousness.\n\n6) Practical implications\n- Assurance: Because justification rests on Christ’s work and God’s declaration, believers can have confident assurance of their status before God, not on the fluctuating states of their own feelings or performance.\n- Security and perseverance: In most Protestant theologies, God’s promise to justify and to keep believers secure is tied to His faithfulness and the ongoing Spirit’s work in them (Romans 8; John 10:28-29).\n- Evangelism and mission: If people are declared righteous by faith, the church’s message is to call sinners to trust in Christ, not to become morally perfect in order to earn acceptance.\n\n7) Variations and theologial nuance (brief note)\n- Protestant emphasis (reformational trajectory): Justification by faith alone (sola fide) is foregrounded, with works understood as the fruit and evidence of faith, not the ground of justification.\n- Catholic and Orthodox perspectives: These traditions often emphasize a broader process of justification that includes transformation and ongoing growth in righteousness, sometimes speaking of infused righteousness and synergistic cooperation with grace. They still affirm that justification is by grace and faith, but they describe the process differently than the typical Protestant forensic model.\n- Within Protestantism, there are nuances (monergism vs. synergism, or differing soteriological emphases), but the core claim that justification is by faith in Christ, grounded in His work, remains central across the tradition.\n\nIn summary\nJustification by faith is the biblical teaching that God, by grace, declares a sinner to be righteous in His sight, not on the basis of the sinner’s own merit but on the basis of Christ’s righteousness received through faith. The believer is united to Christ by faith, Christ’s righteousness is imputed to them, sins are forgiven, and they are reconciled to God. This declaration sets the stage for sanctification, the lifelong process of becoming more like Christ, and it grounds the believer’s hope and assurance before God. If you’d like, I can tailor this to a particular tradition (Reformed, Lutheran, Arminian, Catholic, etc.) and draw out how justification by faith is framed there.",

          "explanation": "The response presents a sound, orthodox Protestant treatment of justification by faith. It defines justification as a forensic declaration grounded in Christ’s righteousness and atoning work, received by faith, not earned by works. It correctly distinguishes justification from sanctification, emphasizes union with Christ, and notes the imputation of Christ’s righteousness alongside the forgiveness of sins (often framed as the “double imputation”). Scripture references align with mainstream Protestant teaching (Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, etc.). It also acknowledges broader Christian variations (e.g., Catholic/Orthodox emphasis on transformation and grace) without asserting them as the sole framework. Overall, there are no heretical claims detected. Minor nuance to consider for ecumenical accuracy: some traditions prefer broader language about transformation in justification (infused righteousness, synergism) or different emphasis on regeneration; the piece already maintains that justification is by grace through faith and distinct from ongoing sanctification. If desired, one could add explicit notes on regeneration and the Holy Spirit’s role in new life to broaden appeal across traditions."
