    "expected": "This resembles Marcionism, a second-century heresy that rejected the Old Testament and taught there were two different gods. This is false. Orthodox Christianity affirms the unity of God across both Testaments. The same God who created the world, gave the law, and showed justice in the Old Testament is the God who sent Jesus. Jesus himself affirmed the Old Testament (Matthew 5:17-18) and revealed God's character as both just and merciful throughout scripture.",
    "output": "This view is **not orthodox Christian teaching**; it is a classic form of **heresy**, historically associated with **Marcionism** (2nd century) and related **Gnostic dualisms**. The Church rejected it because it denies the **unity, goodness, and identity of the one true God** revealed in both Testaments.\n\n## What’s wrong with it?\n\n### 1) It denies the biblical teaching that there is **one God**, not two\nOrthodox Christianity confesses a single God who is Creator and Lord of all history. The “Old Testament God” (YHWH) is not a different deity from the Father of Jesus Christ.\n\n- **Deuteronomy 6:4**: “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.”\n- **Malachi 3:6**: “I the LORD do not change.”\n- The New Testament assumes continuity: the God Jesus calls “Father” is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (cf. **Mark 12:26–27**).\n\nTo split God into an “evil OT god” and a “good NT god” is **polytheism/dualism**, not Christianity.\n\n### 2) Jesus and the apostles affirm the Old Testament as God’s word and revelation\nJesus does not come to expose the OT God as false; he comes as the fulfillment of the OT promises and covenant.\n\n- **Matthew 5:17**: “I have not come to abolish [the Law and the Prophets] but to fulfill them.”\n- Jesus quotes the OT constantly, treats it as authoritative, and identifies its God as “Father.”\n- The apostles preach “the God of our fathers” as the God who raised Jesus (**Acts 3:13–15**).\n\nMarcion’s move historically was to reject/trim the Old Testament and parts of the New Testament; the Church said this guts the gospel itself.\n\n### 3) It caricatures the Old Testament and ignores **God’s mercy** there—and ignores **judgment** in the New Testament\nThe claim “OT = wrathful and evil, NT = good” only works by selective reading.\n\n- The Old Testament repeatedly calls God **good, compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love** (e.g., **Exodus 34:6–7; Psalm 103**).\n- The New Testament includes severe warnings of judgment and wrath (e.g., **Matthew 23; John 3:36; Romans 1:18; Revelation**).\n\nChristian teaching is that God is **both just and merciful** throughout Scripture. Wrath is not “evil”; it is God’s **holy opposition to sin and oppression**.\n\n### 4) It undermines core doctrines: creation, incarnation, and atonement\nIf the OT God (the Creator and covenant Lord) is evil, then major pillars of Christianity collapse:\n\n- **Creation is good** (Genesis 1). Calling the Creator “evil” attacks the doctrine of creation.\n- Jesus is the Messiah promised by the OT; separating him from Israel’s God severs him from his messianic identity.\n- The cross is understood as the fulfillment of God’s saving plan announced in the OT; dividing the gods breaks the coherence of redemption.\n\n### 5) It contradicts historic Christian confession (creeds and catholic consensus)\nThe early Church explicitly rejected Marcionism. The **Apostles’ Creed** begins: “I believe in God, the Father almighty, **creator of heaven and earth**”—identifying the Father of Jesus Christ with the Creator proclaimed in the Old Testament.\n\n## The orthodox alternative\nOrthodox Christianity teaches:\n\n- **One God** (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), consistent in character and purpose.\n- The Old and New Testaments are **one unfolding story**: promise and fulfillment.\n- God’s “wrath” is his righteous judgment against evil; his “mercy” is equally real in both Testaments.\n\nSo what’s wrong with the view is that it **splits God**, **rejects Jesus’ own view of Scripture**, and **replaces biblical faith with a dualistic, Marcionite narrative** that the Church has always condemned as heresy.",

          "rationale": "The response accurately identifies the central doctrinal error (dualism/Marcionism) and correctly asserts unity of God across Testaments, the OT/NT continuity, and the proper Christian reading of God’s justice and mercy. It cites key scriptures, defends orthodox creedal consensus, and provides a coherent corrective. The few caveats are minor historical nuance points (Marcionism vs. broader Gnostic dualism) and a slightly more nuanced handling of the OT’s wrath passages, but neither undermines the overall theological accuracy."
