    "output": "### Biblical Teaching on Homosexuality: A Theological Overview\n\nThe Bible addresses human sexuality within the broader framework of God's design for creation, relationships, and holiness. It consistently portrays sexual intimacy as a gift reserved for marriage between one man and one woman (e.g., Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6; Ephesians 5:31-32). Homosexuality is referenced in several key passages, primarily prohibiting same-sex sexual acts. Interpretations vary widely among Christians, with traditional views seeing these as blanket prohibitions on all homosexual activity, while progressive perspectives argue the texts target exploitative or idolatrous contexts rather than consensual, loving relationships. Below, I'll engage the primary texts, historical-cultural contexts, and major viewpoints for a balanced analysis.\n\n#### Old Testament Foundations\nThe most direct prohibitions appear in the Holiness Code of Leviticus:\n- **Leviticus 18:22**: \"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination\" (ESV).\n- **Leviticus 20:13**: \"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.\"\n\nThese verses are part of laws distinguishing Israel from surrounding Canaanite practices, which often involved temple prostitution, idolatry, and exploitative sex (Leviticus 18:3, 24-30). Critics of the traditional view note that Leviticus also bans mixed fabrics (19:19) and shellfish (11:10), suggesting these are culturally specific purity laws not binding today. Defenders argue the sexual prohibitions are rooted in creation order (Genesis 1-2) and reiterated in the New Testament, distinguishing them from ceremonial laws. The Hebrew phrase *mishkeve ishshah* (\"lying as with a woman\") implies anal intercourse mimicking male-female relations, without qualifiers limiting it to exploitation.\n\nThe story of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19; Ezekiel 16:49-50) is sometimes cited, but Jesus and Jude (Jude 7) link it to sexual immorality (*porneia*), including inhospitality and likely same-sex assault. It doesn't primarily address consensual relationships.\n\n#### New Testament Affirmations\nJesus doesn't explicitly mention homosexuality, but he upholds Genesis 1-2's male-female complementarity (Matthew 19:4-6) and intensifies the law against lustful thoughts (Matthew 5:27-28), which some extend to all non-marital sexual desires.\n\nPaul provides the clearest NT teaching:\n- **Romans 1:26-27**: \"For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men...\"\n  - Here, Paul describes same-sex acts as *para physin* (\"contrary to nature\"), tied to idolatry but presented as inherently disordered, echoing Genesis 1's created order. Progressive scholars argue it critiques pagan excess or pederasty (adult men with boys, common in Greco-Roman culture), not mutual relationships.\n- **1 Corinthians 6:9-10**: \"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral (*pornoi*), nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality (*malakoi* and *arsenokoitai*)... will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n- **1 Timothy 1:9-10**: Lists *arsenokoitai* among lawbreakers.\n\nThe terms *malakoi* (\"soft ones,\" possibly passive partners or effeminates) and *arsenokoitai* (a rare compound word, \"men-bedders,\" coined by Paul from Leviticus 18:22/20:13 LXX) are debated. Traditionalists (e.g., Robert Gagnon in *The Bible and Homosexual Practice*) see them as encompassing all active homosexual practice. Revisionists (e.g., Matthew Vines in *God and the Gay Christian*) claim *arsenokoitai* refers to exploitative acts like prostitution or pederasty, noting its use in vice lists alongside economic exploitation (1 Tim. 1:10).\n\n#### Are Prohibitions Limited to Exploitative Contexts?\n- **Traditional Perspective** (held by Catholics, Evangelicals, Orthodox): No. The texts uniformly condemn all same-sex intercourse as violating God's creational intent. Even consensual acts are \"contrary to nature\" because they can't fulfill procreation and complementarity (Genesis 1:28; Romans 1). Church fathers like John Chrysostom and modern bodies like the Catholic Catechism (2357) affirm this, emphasizing repentance and chastity for all (1 Cor. 6:11).\n- **Affirming Perspective** (some mainline Protestants, e.g., Episcopal, UCC): Yes, limited to ancient abuses. The Bible doesn't envision committed same-sex unions, so modern egalitarian relationships are permissible under love commands (e.g., Galatians 3:28; 1 Corinthians 13). They stress Jesus' silence, the arc from slavery's endorsement to abolition, and cultural shifts.\n- **Middle Ground** (e.g., some Wesleyans like Kevin DeYoung): Acknowledges cultural exploitation but insists the acts themselves are prohibited, akin to adultery.\n\nEmpirical note: Greco-Roman homosexuality was often hierarchical (e.g., Plutarch describes master-slave relations), but Paul uses broad language without qualifiers, unlike his nuance on divorce (1 Cor. 7).\n\n#### Broader Biblical and Theological Context\nScripture frames sexuality covenantally: sex unites spouses into \"one flesh\" mirroring Christ and church (Ephesians 5:22-33). Homosexual acts, by design, can't image this. Yet, the Bible emphasizes grace: all sin is serious (Romans 3:23), but transformation is possible (1 Cor. 6:11). Christians disagree on discipline—some churches bar practicing homosexuals from leadership (1 Tim. 3), others affirm them.\n\nIn practice:\n- **Conservative** (e.g., Southern Baptist): Homosexual relationships are sinful; call to celibacy or heterosexual marriage.\n- **Progressive** (e.g., PCUSA): Affirming, with blessings for same-sex marriages.\n- **Global South churches** (Anglican, Methodist in Africa/Asia) overwhelmingly traditional, per Lambeth Resolution 1.10.\n\nUltimately, the Bible teaches homosexual acts as sinful across contexts, rooted in creation theology, not merely exploitation. However, this doesn't negate love for persons—Christians must embody compassion (Romans 12:15; Galatians 6:2) amid cultural divides. Faithful discernment involves Scripture, tradition, reason, and experience (Wesleyan Quadrilateral). For deeper study, see Gagnon's *The Bible and Homosexual Practice* (traditional) or Vines' *God and the Gay Christian* (affirming). Prayerful engagement with the text is key.",

However, the concluding claim is firm and normative, indicating a dogmatic stance despite its effort to present alternatives. The piece thus takes a clear conservative position while fairly noting opposing viewpoints and nuances, but it ends with a definitive doctrinal position."
