    "expected": "Being made in the image of God means humans uniquely reflect God's nature and character among creation. This includes rational thinking, moral awareness, creativity, relational capacity, and spiritual nature. While sin has marred this image, it hasn't been completely destroyed. The imago Dei gives humans inherent dignity and worth, distinguishes them from animals, and establishes the basis for human morality and purpose.",
    "output": "**The Imago Dei – “Humanity Made in the Image of God”**  \n*A systematic, biblically‑grounded exposition*\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Biblical Basis\n\n| Passage | Key Phrase | Primary Idea |\n|---------|------------|--------------|\n| **Gen 1:26‑27** | “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” | God intentionally creates humans with a distinctive likeness to Himself. |\n| **Gen 5:1‑2** | “Let us make man” / “male and female He created them” | The image is present in both genders. |\n| **Ps 8:3‑5** | “What is man that you are mindful of him… You have made him a little lower than the angels… crowned him with glory and honor” | The image confers honor, dominion, and a share in God’s glory. |\n| **Col 1:15** | “He is the image of the invisible God” (Christ) | Christ is the perfect, incarnate image; humanity’s image is a “image‑type” pointing to Him. |\n| **Rom 8:29** | “conformed… to the image of his Son” | The ultimate destiny of the image is to be renewed in Christ. |\n| **1 Cor 11:7** | “Man is not from woman, but woman from man… the image and glory of God” | The image is relationally expressed in marriage and communal life. |\n| **Eph 4:24** | “Put on the new self, created after the likeness of God” | The image is a moral, spiritual reality that can be “put on” or “taken off.” |\n| **1 John 3:8** | “He who sins is of the devil… He who does not sin is of God” | The image is affected by sin but not destroyed. |\n\nThese texts together give the **full biblical portrait** of what *imago Dei* entails: a created likeness that is functional (stewardship), relational (community), moral (capacity for good), rational (mind), spiritual (capacity for communion with God), and ultimately fulfilled in Christ.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Classical Theological Dimensions\n\n| Dimension | Scripture | Classical Understanding | Contemporary Nuance |\n|-----------|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| **Ontological (essential)** | Gen 1:26‑27; Ps 8:5 | *Augustine* & *Aquinas*: Humans possess a *subsistent* similarity to God in being—rational soul, free will, capacity for love. | Many modern theologians stress that the image is *not* a divine nature but a *capacity* to reflect God’s character. |\n| **Functional (role)** | Gen 1:28; Ps 8:6‑8 | *Reformation*: The image is primarily a *dominion*—rule over creation as God’s representatives (the *cultural mandate*). | Contemporary ethics view dominion as *stewardship* and *service* rather than exploitation. |\n| **Relational (community)** | 1 Cor 11:7; Gen 2:18‑24 | *Patristic*: The image is expressed in *personhood* and *relationship* (Trinitarian analogy). | Modern anthropology emphasizes the image’s expression in *covenantal* and *social* relationships. |\n| **Moral/Ethical** | Rom 2:14‑15; Eph 5:1‑2 | *Augustine*: Image entails an *inclination toward the good* that can be corrupted by sin. | The image is seen as the basis for human dignity and universal moral responsibility. |\n| **Redemptive (Christological)** | Col 1:15; Rom 8:29 | *Christ as the “Perfect Image”*: Humanity is being conformed to Christ, who restores the image. | The *new creation* language underscores that the restored image is fully realized in and through Christ. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. What the Imago Dei **Means** for Humanity\n\n#### 3.1. **Inherent Dignity**\n- Because every person bears God’s image, **all human life is intrinsically valuable** (Gen 1:27; Matt 10:29‑31). This undergirds the Christian ethic of **sanctity of life** and the **equality** of every person, regardless of race, gender, status, or ability (Gal 3:28).\n\n#### 3.2. **Capacity for Relationship with God**\n- The image is a *capacity* for **communion** (Ps 8:4; John 1:12). Humans are uniquely able to know, love, worship, and be in fellowship with God. This relational faculty is *corrupted* but not annihilated by sin (Rom 3:23).\n\n#### 3.3. **Moral Agency and Responsibility**\n- The image gives **free will** and **conscience** (Rom 2:14‑15). Humans are called to **choose good** and are accountable for sin (Rom 6:23). The moral law reflects the image’s orientation toward the good.\n\n#### 3.4. **Rationality and Creativity**\n- In being made “after our image,” humans possess **intellect, imagination, and the ability to speak truthfully** (Gen 1:26; 1 Cor 2:16). This underwrites culture, art, science, and the **cultural mandate** to **cultivate and develop creation** (Gen 1:28).\n\n#### 3.5. **Dominion as Stewardship**\n- The *functional* aspect means humanity is **God’s representative**, tasked to **subdue** and **guard** creation (Genesis 2:15). This is not a license for exploitation but a call to **covenantal stewardship** (Psalm 24:1; Romans 8:19‑22).\n\n#### 3.6. **Communal Identity**\n- The image is **realized in community** (Genesis 2:18). Marriage, family, church, and all human relationships reflect the **triune nature of God** (love, unity, diversity). The New Testament’s emphasis on the Body of Christ (1 Cor 12) shows the image’s fullest expression in **mutual love and service**.\n\n#### 3.7. **Effect of the Fall**\n- Sin **marred** the image (Rom 5:12; Gen 3). It produces *distortion*: pride, selfishness, violence, etc. Yet the image **remains** (Eph 4:24; 2 Cor 5:17) and can be **renewed** through Christ’s work.\n\n#### 3.8. **Redemptive Restoration**\n- **Christ** is the *perfect image* (Col 1:15). Believers are **conformed** to His likeness (Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 3:18). The **new creation** (2 Cor 5:17) will fully restore the image in the eschaton (Rev 21:1‑4).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Theological Implications\n\n| Area | Imago Dei‑Based Teaching |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Christology** | Christ as the *second Adam* and *full revelation* of the image (cf. 1 Cor 15:45‑49). |\n| **Soteriology** | Salvation is the *re‑creation* of the image (2 Cor 5:17). Justification restores the status of being God’s children (John 1:12). |\n| **Ecclesiology** | The Church is the *body* that displays the image corporately (Eph 4:15‑16). |\n| **Eschatology** | The final consummation involves the *full manifestation* of the image in the renewed creation (Rev 21). |\n| **Ethics** | All moral norms flow from the dignity of the image (e.g., forbidding murder, slavery, oppression, environmental abuse). |\n| **Anthropology** | Human nature is *created* good, *fallen* but *redeemable*; the image is the \"goodness\" that awaits restoration. |\n| **Missiology** | The gospel calls all peoples to be *re‑made* in Christ’s image, thus the *great commission* is also a call to restore all humanity’s likeness to God (Matt 28:18‑20). |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Common Misunderstandings Clarified\n\n| Misunderstanding | Biblical/Traditional Correction |\n|------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **“The image means we are part‑god.”** | The image is **analogical**, not **univocal** (cf. Augustine, Aquinas): we share in *attributes* (reason, love) but not the *essence* of God. |\n| **“Since the image is corrupted, it is lost.”** | Scripture affirms the image **remains** (Eph 4:24) and will be **renewed**, not annihilated. |\n| **“The image is only about intellect.”** | While intellect is part, the image also includes *relational, moral, and functional* dimensions (see §§2‑4). |\n| **“Dominion permits exploitation.”** | Biblical dominion is **stewardship** (Gen 2:15) and **service**, reflecting God’s own self‑giving love (John 3:16). |\n| **“Only certain people bear the image.”** | The image is **universal**: “male and female He created them” (Gen 1:27); no *ethnic* or *cultural* restriction. |\n\n---\n\n### 6. A Concise Definition\n\n> **Imago Dei** is the biblical doctrine that every human being, created by God in the fullness of his creative act, reflects God’s own nature **ontologically** (as a rational, relational, moral being), **functionally** (as a steward and representative of God’s reign over creation), and **relationally** (in the capacity to love God and neighbor). Though the image is marred by sin, it is never destroyed; through Christ it is being progressively restored, culminating in the eschatological renewal of humanity and all creation.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Practical Take‑aways for the Christian Life\n\n1. **Affirm Human Dignity** – Treat every person with respect; oppose oppression, racism, sexism, and any form of dehumanization.  \n2. **Cultivate Stewardship** – Care for the environment; use resources wisely as God’s caretaker.  \n3. **Live in Community** – Seek healthy relationships that reflect the relational nature of the image.  \n4. **Pursue Moral Renewal** – Allow the Holy Spirit to “put on the new self” (Eph 4:24), growing in love, justice, and holiness.  \n5. **Proclaim Christ** – Share the gospel that restores the image through Christ, the perfect revelation of God’s likeness.\n\n---\n\n**In sum**, the doctrine of the *imago Dei* is a foundational biblical truth that shapes Christian anthropology, ethics, soteriology, and eschatology. It declares that humanity, created good and bearing God’s likeness, is called to reflect His character, steward His creation, live in loving community, and ultimately be restored to the full, unblemished image in Christ at the consummation of all things.",

          "explanation": "Overall, the response presents a robust, biblically grounded, orthodox account of the Imago Dei. It aligns with historic Christian teaching on creation in God’s image, the fall, and redemption in Christ, with appropriate notes on ontology, function, and relational/moral dimensions. A few non-heretical issues to clarify or adjust for precision (not indicators of heresy):\n- Language about the image being able to be “put on” or “taken off” is uncommon for describing the image itself. It is better to say believers “live out” or “put on” the new self in Christ (Eph 4:24) while recognizing the image is marred by sin but not destroyed. The potential impression that the image can be literally removed should be avoided or carefully qualified.\n- 1 John 3:8 is quoted in a simplified form. The conventional text distinguishes between the source of sin (the devil) and the reality that those born of God do not make a practice of sin (1 John 3:9). A precise quote helps prevent misreadings about sinlessness.\n- 1 Corinthians 11:7 is cited in a way that could be read as exclusive to the image-bearing of men or as a formula about the image. The broader biblical pattern affirms that the image of God is shared universally by both male and female (Gen 1:27) and should be presented with careful exegesis of the surrounding passage.\n- The ongoing debate about ontological (substantive) versus functional aspects of the image is acknowledged, but the piece could emphasize that both dimensions are present in traditional summaries of the imago Dei. Keeping explicit that the image refers to a real, though marred, reflection of God helps avoid inadvertent slides into non-orthodox claims about a diminished or dissolved image.\n\nSuggestions for tightening accuracy (non-harmful, non-heresy-attribution):\n- Use precise wording for 1 John 3:8–9 to reflect the text’s distinction between the source of sin and the ongoing nature of being born of God.\n- When citing 1 Corinthians 11:7, note the broader Gen 1:27 claim that both genders bear the image of God, and treat the Corinthian passage as addressing issues of order/headship in a specific cultural/contextual setting, not as a universal denial of image-bearing for women.\n- Consider reframing the “taken off” language to highlight the Pauline metaphor of the old self vs the new self, and stress that the image is marred by sin but not eradicated, with restoration in Christ (Rom 8:29; Eph 4:24; Col 3:10).\n\nIn sum, no explicit heresiological errors are detected; the content remains within orthodox bounds. The few points above are clarifications to prevent potential misinterpretation and to align wording with standard exegesis."

Classical Theological Dimensions\n\n| Dimension | Scripture | Classical Understanding | Contemporary Nuance |\n|-----------|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| **Ontological (essential)** | Gen 1:26‑27; Ps 8:5 | *Augustine* & *Aquinas*: Humans possess a *subsistent* similarity to God in being—rational soul, free will, capacity for love. | Many modern theologians stress that the image is *not* a divine nature but a *capacity* to reflect God’s character. |\n| **Functional (role)** | Gen 1:28; Ps 8:6‑8 | *Reformation*: The image is primarily a *dominion*—rule over creation as God’s representatives (the *cultural mandate*). | Contemporary ethics view dominion as *stewardship* and *service* rather than exploitation. |\n| **Relational (community)** | 1 Cor 11:7; Gen 2:18‑24 | *Patristic*: The image is expressed in *personhood* and *relationship* (Trinitarian analogy). | Modern anthropology emphasizes the image’s expression in *covenantal* and *social* relationships. |\n| **Moral/Ethical** | Rom 2:14‑15; Eph 5:1‑2 | *Augustine*: Image entails an *inclination toward the good* that can be corrupted by sin. | The image is seen as the basis for human dignity and universal moral responsibility. |\n| **Redemptive (Christological)** | Col 1:15; Rom 8:29 | *Christ as the “Perfect Image”*: Humanity is being conformed to Christ, who restores the image. | The *new creation* language underscores that the restored image is fully realized in and through Christ. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. What the Imago Dei **Means** for Humanity\n\n#### 3.1. **Inherent Dignity**\n- Because every person bears God’s image, **all human life is intrinsically valuable** (Gen 1:27; Matt 10:29‑31). This undergirds the Christian ethic of **sanctity of life** and the **equality** of every person, regardless of race, gender, status, or ability (Gal 3:28).\n\n#### 3.2. **Capacity for Relationship with God**\n- The image is a *capacity* for **communion** (Ps 8:4; John 1:12). Humans are uniquely able to know, love, worship, and be in fellowship with God. This relational faculty is *corrupted* but not annihilated by sin (Rom 3:23).\n\n#### 3.3. **Moral Agency and Responsibility**\n- The image gives **free will** and **conscience** (Rom 2:14‑15). Humans are called to **choose good** and are accountable for sin (Rom 6:23). The moral law reflects the image’s orientation toward the good.\n\n#### 3.4. **Rationality and Creativity**\n- In being made “after our image,” humans possess **intellect, imagination, and the ability to speak truthfully** (Gen 1:26; 1 Cor 2:16). This underwrites culture, art, science, and the **cultural mandate** to **cultivate and develop creation** (Gen 1:28).\n\n#### 3.5. **Dominion as Stewardship**\n- The *functional* aspect means humanity is **God’s representative**, tasked to **subdue** and **guard** creation (Genesis 2:15). This is not a license for exploitation but a call to **covenantal stewardship** (Psalm 24:1; Romans 8:19‑22).\n\n#### 3.6. **Communal Identity**\n- The image is **realized in community** (Genesis 2:18). Marriage, family, church, and all human relationships reflect the **triune nature of God** (love, unity, diversity). The New Testament’s emphasis on the Body of Christ (1 Cor 12) shows the image’s fullest expression in **mutual love and service**.\n\n#### 3.7. **Effect of the Fall**\n- Sin **marred** the image (Rom 5:12; Gen 3). It produces *distortion*: pride, selfishness, violence, etc. Yet the image **remains** (Eph 4:24; 2 Cor 5:17) and can be **renewed** through Christ’s work.\n\n#### 3.8. **Redemptive Restoration**\n- **Christ** is the *perfect image* (Col 1:15). Believers are **conformed** to His likeness (Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 3:18). The **new creation** (2 Cor 5:17) will fully restore the image in the eschaton (Rev 21:1‑4).\n\n---\n\n### 4.
