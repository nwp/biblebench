    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "## Step 1: Understand the Statement\nThe preacher's statement suggests that salvation is achieved through good works and moral living, implying that one's actions directly influence their attainment of heaven.\n\n## Step 2: Identify Relevant Biblical Teachings\nThe Bible teaches that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28). It emphasizes that good works are a result of salvation, not the cause (Ephesians 2:10).\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the Statement Against Biblical Teachings\nThe statement contradicts the biblical doctrine of salvation by faith alone. According to the Bible, good works are evidence of a person's faith and a natural consequence of being saved, but they do not earn salvation.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if the Statement Represents Orthodox Christian Teaching or Heresy\nOrthodox Christian teaching holds that salvation is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ, and not earned by human efforts (Titus 3:5). The preacher's statement that salvation is achieved through good works and moral living aligns more with legalism or works-righteousness, which is considered heretical because it undermines the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for salvation.\n\n## Step 5: Explain Why the Statement is Not Biblical Teaching\nThe statement is not biblical teaching because it misrepresents the mechanism of salvation. The Bible clearly states that salvation is by faith, not by works (Romans 3:28, Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as a demonstration of faith and obedience to God, they are not the means by which one is saved.\n\n## Step 6: Conclusion\nThe preacher's claim that \"Salvation is achieved through good works and moral living. If you live a good life, you will earn your way to heaven\" is not orthodox Christian teaching. It represents a form of legalism or works-righteousness, which is considered heretical because it denies the biblical doctrine of salvation by faith alone.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Heresy}$",

            "The response would benefit from explicit engagement with James 2:14–26, which teaches that faith without works is dead and that genuine faith is evidenced by works. While it correctly asserts that works are the fruit of salvation, a fuller treatment in dialogue with James would prevent implying that works can be wholly separated from a living faith.",
            "The phrasing could acknowledge that some traditions interpret Romans 3:28 and Ephesians 2:8–9 in a way that allows for a cooperative role of grace and works (e.g., sanctification and ongoing obedience) within a framework of salvation by grace, to avoid over-simplifying to a strict “faith alone” vs. “works” dichotomy."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s response aligns with orthodox Protestant teaching: salvation is by grace through faith, not by works of the law, with good works as evidence and fruit of true faith (Ephesians 2:8–10; Titus 3:5; Romans 3:28). It correctly identifies the preacher’s claim as legalistic/works-righteousness and labels it as incompatible with biblical teaching. It also uses Scripture to ground its claims (Ephesians, Romans, Titus). The main strengths are clear articulation of the mechanism of salvation and the role of works as fruit, not cause. The main gaps are a more explicit engagement with James 2 (faith plus works) to accurately reflect the biblical tension between faith and works, and a brief note acknowledging historical interpretations that emphasize grace plus cooperative sanctification in some traditions. Overall, the assessment is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded, with minor nuance gaps.)"
