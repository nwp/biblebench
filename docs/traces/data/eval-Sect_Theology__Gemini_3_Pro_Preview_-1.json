    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "As a theologian analyzing this position, it is important to first acknowledge the shared vocabulary. Both historic Christianity and the theology derived from the \"Standard Works\" of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) speak of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Both view Jesus Christ as the Savior and the central figure of human history.\n\nHowever, when one accepts the *Book of Mormon*, *Doctrine and Covenants* (D&C), and *Pearl of Great Price* alongside the Bible, the definitions of these three persons shift significantly from the definitions held by historic, orthodox Christianity (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant).\n\nThe orthodox view is defined largely by the Nicene Creed (325/381 AD), which sought to codify biblical teaching into a precise framework. The LDS view is defined by the additional revelations given to Joseph Smith. Here is an analysis of the primary theological agreements and departures.\n\n### 1. The Nature of Unity: Consubstantiality vs. Social Unity\n**Orthodox Christian Theology:**\nHistoric Christianity teaches that there is strictly one God (*monotheism*). The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct persons (*hypostases*) who share one single, undivided divine essence (*ousia*). They are \"consubstantial\" (of one being). Therefore, God is numerically one.\n\n**LDS Theology:**\nDrawing specifically from the *Doctrine and Covenants* and the *Pearl of Great Price*, LDS theology teaches that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct *beings*. In this view, they are \"one\" in purpose, will, and love, but they are not one in essence or being. This is often described as a \"social Trinity\"—three separate Gods acting in perfect unison.\n\n*   **The Departure:** Orthodoxy asserts the three are One Being; LDS theology asserts they are three separate Beings (a view orthodoxy would technically classify as tritheism, though LDS theology emphasizes a monotheistic pattern of worship directed toward the Father).\n\n### 2. The Nature of the Father: Spirit vs. Corporeality\n**Orthodox Christian Theology:**\nRelying on texts such as John 4:24 (\"God is spirit\"), historic Christianity teaches that God the Father is immaterial, invisible, and without body parts or passions. He is the infinite, uncreated source of all reality.\n\n**LDS Theology:**\n*Doctrine and Covenants* 130:22 states specifically: *\"The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit.\"*\n\n*   **The Departure:** The belief that God the Father possesses a physical, exalted human body is perhaps the most confusing distinction for traditional Christians. Historic theology maintains the Father has never been incarnate; LDS theology teaches that possessing a physical body is a necessary attribute of His perfection.\n\n### 3. The Eternality of God: Aseity vs. Eternal Progression\n**Orthodox Christian Theology:**\nChristians believe in the *aseity* of God—meaning God is self-existent, uncreated, and eternal. God has always been God, from everlasting to everlasting (Psalm 90:2). There was never a time when God was not God.\n\n**LDS Theology:**\nWhile the *Book of Mormon* speaks of God being unchangeable, later LDS revelation (and the interpretive lens provided by Joseph Smith’s \"King Follett Discourse\") clarifies a doctrine of \"Eternal Progression.\" This teaches that God the Father was once a man on a previous earth who lived mortally, died, was resurrected, and progressed to Godhood. This is encapsulated in the couplet by LDS President Lorenzo Snow: *\"As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be.\"*\n\n*   **The Departure:** Historic Christianity posits an infinite \"ontological gap\" between Creator and creature—they are two different types of existence. LDS theology posits a continuum; God and man are the same species, at different stages of development.\n\n### 4. The Origin of Jesus and the Logic of Sonship\n**Orthodox Christian Theology:**\nJesus is the \"only begotten\" Son, meaning he is eternally generated from the Father's essence. He is uncreated.\n\n**LDS Theology:**\nIn LDS teaching (derived from the *Pearl of Great Price*), all humans existed as spirits before birth. Jesus is the \"firstborn\" spirit child of our Heavenly Parents (implying a Heavenly Mother alongside the Father). Therefore, Jesus is the literal elder brother of all humanity (and Lucifer) in the pre-mortal existence.\n\n*   **The Departure:** Orthodoxy views Christ as uncreated Creator; LDS theology views Christ as the firstborn of the spirit children, who achieved Godhood under the direction of the Father.\n\n### Summary Analysis\nTo say one believes in the Godhead as taught in the LDS Standard Works is to affirm a theology that historically falls outside the bounds of the Nicene definition of Christianity.\n\n*   **Agreement:** Both traditions affirm the divinity of Christ, His atonement, correct worship of the Father, and the distinct personhood of the Spirit.\n*   **Departure:** The fundamental disagreement lies in the *nature* of God. Historic Christianity is strictly monotheistic (One Being), believing in an immaterial, self-existent God. The theology of the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price presents a form of pluralism (Three Beings) and a materialist metaphysics (God has a body; spirit is matter), wherein God is an exalted Man.\n\nFrom a standpoint of comparative religion, while the names are the same, the ontological reality (the definition of *what* those beings are) is profoundly different.",

            "The response labels LDS belief as 'tritheism' and 'three separate beings' in a way that could oversimplify or mischaracterize LDS self-understanding. Many Latter-day Saints describe the Godhead as three distinct beings united in purpose rather than three separate gods; orthodox critique often uses 'tritheism,' but this label is contested and can mislead about LDS self-understanding of monotheism.",
            "The handling of eternal progression and the King Follett discourse is a delicate area. The statement that eternal progression is a settled, canonical LDS doctrine, or that later revelation definitively clarifies it, is not straightforward. Eternal progression is discussed in Church teaching and history, but it is not a formal, universally accepted canon doctrine with the same weight as core LDS scriptures; the King Follett discourse is a speech not canonical Scripture, and LDS teachings on God’s nature are nuanced and vary in emphasis among leaders and scholars.",
            "The claim about the Book of Mormon’s view of God as unchangeable is potentially misleading. LDS scripture and teaching affirm God’s righteousness and immutability in certain respects, but the specific assertion that the Book of Mormon explicitly teaches a universal immutability of God in the same way as classical immutability language is not as clear-cut and may oversimplify nuanced scriptural weight on immutability across Mormon texts.",
            "Overall, the answer is solid in outlining major doctrinal contrasts (Godhead, canon, pre-mortal existence, and nature of God) but would benefit from acknowledging more LDS nuance and the range of LDS interpretations instead of framing certain points as dogmatic Church positions."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies major doctrinal divergences between historic (Trinitarian) Christianity and LDS theology: a non-substantive unity (three beings vs one essence), literal bodied Father (and Son) in LDS teaching, pre-mortal existence and Jesus as firstborn, and the role of additional scripture. It aligns with orthodox critique in key points and cites Scripture (John 4:24) and LDS sources (D&C 130:22) to ground claims. However, it risks over-simplifying LDS self-understanding by labeling the Godhead as “tritheism” and “three separate beings,” which many Mormons would dispute or reinterpret as “three distinct personages united in purpose.” It also treats Eternal Progression and the King Follett discourse as clear, canonical doctrine, whereas those areas are historically contested and nuanced within LDS scholarship and church teaching. A tighter treatment would acknowledge the spectrum of LDS positions and explicitly distinguish canonical scripture from non-canonical historical lectures, while avoiding definitive theological weight on points that are debated within Mormon thought. The Bible-grounding is present but would be stronger with specific verse citations beyond John 4:24 for Father’s nature and explicit New Testament affirmations of the Trinity for contrast. Overall, the answer is solid and nuanced but would benefit from refinements in how it presents LDS doctrinal certainty on certain topics."
