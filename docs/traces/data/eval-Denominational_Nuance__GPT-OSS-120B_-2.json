    "expected": "Calvinism and Arminianism differ primarily on sovereignty and free will. Calvinists emphasize God's unconditional election, where God chooses who will be saved based solely on His will (TULIP: Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance of saints). Arminians emphasize that God's election is based on foreknowledge of who will freely choose faith, that Christ's atonement is unlimited, that grace can be resisted, and that believers can potentially lose salvation. Both affirm salvation by grace through faith and God's sovereignty, but differ on how divine sovereignty relates to human choice. Both views have been held by orthodox Christians throughout church history.",
    "output": "**Calvinism and Arminianism – A Balanced Overview**\n\nBoth Calvinism and Arminianism are theological systems that grew out of the Protestant Reformation and seek to explain how God’s grace, human freedom, and salvation work together.  They share the core orthodox commitments of historic Christianity (the Trinity, the incarnation, the atoning death and resurrection of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, the authority of Scripture, etc.).  Their differences lie mainly in how they understand **God’s sovereignty and human responsibility** in the application of that saving grace.  Below is a concise, neutral presentation of the major points of agreement and disagreement, together with how they are received in various Christian traditions.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The “Five Points” Framework\n\nThe classic way the two systems are contrasted is the **“TULIP”** acronym for Calvinism and the **“Four‑Point”** summary for classic Arminianism.  (The fifth “point”—the assurance of final perseverance—is treated differently, as noted later.)\n\n| Topic | Calvinist (Reformed) View | Classical Arminian View |\n|-------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Total Depravity** | Human nature is totally corrupted by sin; apart from divine initiative we are unable to choose God or do any good. | Human nature is fallen and sinful, but **prevenient grace** restores enough ability for a genuine free response to the gospel. |\n| **Unconditional Election** | God elects individuals to salvation **apart from any foreseen merit or decision**; election is based solely on His sovereign will. | God elects **conditionally**, based on His foreknowledge of who will freely respond in faith. Election is thus linked to a genuine human decision. |\n| **Limited (Particular) Atonement** | Christ’s death **effectively secures salvation only for the elect**; his atonement is sufficient and efficient for those chosen. | **Unlimited (or universal) atonement**: Christ died for *all* people, making salvation possible for anyone, though only those who believe receive its benefits. |\n| **Irresistible Grace** | When God extends saving grace to the elect, it **overcomes** any resistance; the elect inevitably come to saving faith. | **Resistible grace**: God’s grace can be **kept in check** by human free will; a person can reject the call of the Spirit. |\n| **Perseverance of the Saints** | The elect **continue in faith** to the end; true believers cannot lose salvation (though they may fall into sin). | **Conditional security**: Believers may **fall away** and lose saving grace if they persistently reject Christ (though many Arminians hold to “eternal security” as a possible, not necessary, outcome). |\n\n*Note*: Not every denomination that identifies with one camp embraces every point in the same way.  Many churches hold a **“mixed” or “moderate”** position that picks elements from both traditions (e.g., “Corporate Election” in some Reformed circles, or “Conditional Irresistibility” in certain Wesleyan bodies).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Historical Roots & Denominational Landscapes\n\n| Tradition | Key Figures | Typical Denominational Expressions |\n|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Calvinism (Reformed Theology)** | John Calvin, Theodore Beza, the Synod of Dort (1618‑1619) | • Presbyterian churches (PCUSA, PCA, OPC, etc.)  <br>• Reformed churches (Christian Reformed, United Reformed) <br>• Many **continental Reformed** bodies (e.g., Dutch Reformed) <br>• Some **Baptist** groups (e.g., “Particular Baptists”) |\n| **Arminianism (Wesleyan‑Methodist Theology)** | Jacobus Arminius, Johannes *theodore* (a.k.a. “Remonstrants”), John Wesley | • United Methodist Church, African Methodist Episcopal, etc.<br>• Wesleyan and Nazarene churches<br>• Most **Methodist‑influenced** denominations <br>• Many **Pentecostal** groups (though some Pentecostals hold to a “Calvinistic” view) <br>• Certain **Baptist** bodies (e.g., “Free‑will Baptists”) |\n| **Middle‑Ground / “Calvin‑Arminian” Hybrids** | 19th‑20th‑century scholars (e.g., John Calhoun, B.B. Warfield) | • Some **Reformed Baptist** churches adopt “conditional election” while retaining confessional distinctives.<br>• Certain **Evangelical** churches hold to “Corporate Election” (the election of the people of God rather than specific individuals). |\n\nThese classifications are **descriptive, not prescriptive**; each congregation may articulate its own nuanced stance within the broader umbrella.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Core Points of Agreement\n\n1. **Grace Is Essential** – Both traditions affirm that **salvation is a gift of God’s grace**, not something earned by human merit.\n2. **Christ’s Atonement Is Sufficient** – The death of Christ fully satisfies divine justice; the disagreement is about *who* actually receives its benefits.\n3. **Faith Is Gifted** – Both affirm that true saving faith arises from the Holy Spirit; the debate is whether that gift can be resisted.\n4. **The Sovereignty of God** – Both hold that God is supreme and ultimate authority, though they differ on *how* His sovereignty interacts with human freedom.\n5. **Scripture as Normative Authority** – Both derive their doctrines primarily from the Bible, interpreting the same passages (e.g., Romans 9, John 3:16, Ephesians 2:8‑9) in different ways.\n\nThese shared convictions keep both camps firmly within historic orthodoxy.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Theological Themes Behind the Disagreements\n\n### a. **Human Depravity & Ability**\n* **Calvinists** read passages such as **Ephesians 2:1‑3** and **Romans 3:10‑12** to mean that “the human will is *dead*” apart from divine regeneration.\n* **Arminians** accept the depth of sin but argue that **God’s prevenient grace** (cf. **John 12:32**, **Acts 10:38**) restores a minimal capacity to respond.\n\n### b. **Election & Foreknowledge**\n* **Unconditional election** emphasizes God’s free, sovereign choice (cf. **Romans 9:11‑13**).  \n* **Conditional election** ties God’s choice to foreknowledge of human response (cf. **Romans 8:29‑30**, **1 Peter 1:2**).\n\n### c. **Extent of the Atonement**\n* **Limited atonement** is defended by passages that speak of Christ “*the firstborn among many brothers*” (Col 1:15) and “*the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep*” (John 10:11).\n* **Unlimited atonement** leans on universal language: “*For God so loved the world*” (John 3:16), “*All have sinned*” (Rom 3:23) and “*Christ died for the sins of the whole world*” (1 John 2:2).\n\n### d. **Irresistibility vs. Resistibility of Grace**\n* **Irresistible Grace** points to the transformation of the elect’s heart (cf. **John 6:44**, **Acts 13:48**).\n* **Resistible Grace** stresses human agency in responding to the Spirit’s call (cf. **Acts 7:51**, **Heb 3:15**).\n\n### e. **Perseverance and Apostasy**\n* **Calvinists** see perseverance as a **guaranteed** outcome of election (cf. **John 10:28‑29**, **Romans 8:38‑39**).  \n* **Arminians** hold that genuine believers can **fall away** (cf. **Heb 6:4‑6**, **2 Peter 2:20‑22**) but also recognize the biblical witness to the security of the redeemed (cf. **1 John 5:13**), leading to a spectrum of “eternal security” views.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical & Pastoral Implications\n\n| Area | Calvinist‑in‑Practice Emphasis | Arminian‑in‑Practice Emphasis |\n|------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Preaching** | Assurance of God’s election often fuels “confidence” preaching; emphasis on “God’s glory in salvation.” | Evangelistic urgency (“every person can be saved”); focus on “responding to God’s invitation.” |\n| **Discipleship** | Strong stress on **sanctification** as the fruit of election and perseverance. | Emphasis on **growth in holiness**, often with explicit warnings against willful rejection. |\n| **Mission & Evangelism** | Both traditions are mission‑oriented; Calvinists may stress “God‑ordained” mission (e.g., *the gospel is preached to the elect*). | Arminians often stress “universal proclamation” because anyone can respond. |\n| **Assurance** | Assurance is rooted in **the promises of God** and the visible fruit of the Holy Spirit. | Assurance is often linked to **personal faith** and ongoing reliance on grace; some caution against presumption. |\n\nBoth traditions teach that true faith produces **love, humility, and obedience**, and they reject any notion that salvation can be earned through works alone.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Where the Dialogue Lives Today\n\n1. **“Corporate Election”** – Some Reformed scholars (e.g., **Geerhardus Vos**, **John Frame**) speak of God electing *the people of God* rather than a predetermined list of individuals.  This language attempts to bridge the gap with Arminian “conditional election.”\n2. **“Conditional Irresistibility”** – Certain Wesleyan theologians argue that while the Holy Spirit’s call is powerful, it may be resisted when a person consciously rebuffs it.\n3. **“Perseverance with Warning”** – Both the **Los Angeles** and **St. Andrews** statements (late‑20th‑century ecumenical documents) acknowledge that **genuine believers can fall into sin** and need continual repentance, while still maintaining the doctrine of final perseverance for those truly regenerated.\n4. **Ecumenical Conferences** – Bodies such as the **World Council of Churches** and the **International Pentecostal Holiness Church** routinely host panels where Calvinist and Arminian scholars discuss these topics with mutual respect.\n\nThese conversations illustrate that the **Calvinist–Arminian spectrum** is not a rigid binary but a **theological continuum** within the broader Reformed and Wesleyan traditions.\n\n---\n\n## 7. A Concise Summary for the Curious Reader\n\n| Feature | Calvinist (Reformed) | Arminian (Wesleyan) |\n|---------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| **Human ability after the fall** | *Totally dead*; needs **regeneration** before any faith. | **Prevenient grace** restores enough capacity to choose. |\n| **How God chooses who will be saved** | **Unconditional election**—God’s sovereign will alone. | **Conditional election**—God elects those He foresees will freely believe. |\n| **Who Christ died for** | **Limited atonement**—the elect alone. | **Unlimited atonement**—all people. |\n| **Nature of saving grace** | **Irresistible** for the elect; they cannot ultimately refuse. | **Resistible**; the Spirit can be resisted. |\n| **Can a true believer lose salvation?** | **No** – perseverance is assured. | **Possibly** – a believer can apostatize, though many hold that those who truly trust Christ will ultimately remain. |\n| **Typical denominational families** | Presbyterian, Reformed, some Baptists. | Methodist, Wesleyan, many Pentecostal, some Baptists. |\n\nBoth systems aim to **protect the gospel’s central claim**: that **Jesus Christ alone, through His atoning work, offers salvation as a free gift of God’s grace**.  The differences lie in *how* that gift is applied to humanity, reflecting genuine, long‑standing theological reflection within the Christian family.\n\n---\n\n### Closing Thought\n\nThe Calvinist–Arminian debate is a **rich, scripturally rooted conversation** that has sharpened the church’s articulation of God’s love, justice, and sovereignty.  Recognizing the **faithful convictions on both sides**—while holding fast to the essential doctrines that unite all historic Christianity—offers a model for how Christians can engage theological diversity with **charity, humility, and reverence for God’s mystery**.",

Theological Themes Behind the Disagreements\n\n### a. **Human Depravity & Ability**\n* **Calvinists** read passages such as **Ephesians 2:1‑3** and **Romans 3:10‑12** to mean that “the human will is *dead*” apart from divine regeneration.\n* **Arminians** accept the depth of sin but argue that **God’s prevenient grace** (cf. **John 12:32**, **Acts 10:38**) restores a minimal capacity to respond.\n\n### b. **Election & Foreknowledge**\n* **Unconditional election** emphasizes God’s free, sovereign choice (cf. **Romans 9:11‑13**).  \n* **Conditional election** ties God’s choice to foreknowledge of human response (cf. **Romans 8:29‑30**, **1 Peter 1:2**).\n\n### c. **Extent of the Atonement**\n* **Limited atonement** is defended by passages that speak of Christ “*the firstborn among many brothers*” (Col 1:15) and “*the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep*” (John 10:11).\n* **Unlimited atonement** leans on universal language: “*For God so loved the world*” (John 3:16), “*All have sinned*” (Rom 3:23) and “*Christ died for the sins of the whole world*” (1 John 2:2).\n\n### d. **Irresistibility vs. Resistibility of Grace**\n* **Irresistible Grace** points to the transformation of the elect’s heart (cf. **John 6:44**, **Acts 13:48**).\n* **Resistible Grace** stresses human agency in responding to the Spirit’s call (cf. **Acts 7:51**, **Heb 3:15**).\n\n### e. **Perseverance and Apostasy**\n* **Calvinists** see perseverance as a **guaranteed** outcome of election (cf. **John 10:28‑29**, **Romans 8:38‑39**).  \n* **Arminians** hold that genuine believers can **fall away** (cf. **Heb 6:4‑6**, **2 Peter 2:20‑22**) but also recognize the biblical witness to the security of the redeemed (cf. **1 John 5:13**), leading to a spectrum of “eternal security” views.\n\n---\n\n## 5.
