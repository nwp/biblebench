    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "I’m so glad you reached out. This is a deeply tender moment for you and for your daughter, and your desire to respond with both truth and love matters a lot. Doubt among teenagers is common, and it can become a doorway into a firmer, more resilient faith if navigated with grace and honesty. Here’s a way to respond that is biblically grounded, pastorally gentle, and practically doable.\n\n1) In the immediate moment: listen, affirm, and resist panic\n- Say less, listen more. Give her space to name what she’s feeling without closing doors with quick fixes or guilt.\n- Validate her feelings: “I’m devastated to hear you’re hurting this much. It’s okay to have questions and to be unsure right now.”\n- Communicate safety and love: “I love you regardless of what you believe. I’m here to walk with you, not to pressure you to think a certain way.”\n- Avoid shaming or belittling doubt. Do not pile on guilt or pretend certainty you don’t feel yourself.\n\n2) Create a safe space for questions to be explored\n- Tell her you want to understand her questions and help her seek honest answers.\n- Offer a structure that minimizes pressure: weekly check-ins, a shared reading list, or a “question box” where she can drop questions she wants to discuss.\n- Normalize questions as part of growing faith: doubt is not the enemy of faith if it leads to truth and trust in God.\n\n3) Practical next steps you can take together\n- Name the questions: Invite her to tell you her top questions (about God, the church, science, suffering, doubt, identity, etc.). Write them down and tackle one or two at a time.\n- Read and discuss together: pick short, thoughtful passages that speak to doubt, longing, and God’s faithfulness. For example:\n  - Mark 9:24 “I believe; help my unbelief” to acknowledge both faith and doubt.\n  - Psalm 13 and Psalm 22 for honest lament before God.\n  - Hebrews 11 (faith and imperfect people) and Romans 8:28-39 on God’s good purposes in pain.\n  - John 14:6 and John 20:29 for trust in Jesus as the way to life, even when we don’t see clearly.\n  - 1 Thessalonians 5:21 and Proverbs 18:15 about testing and seeking understanding.\n- Involve trustworthy mentors: a compassionate youth pastor, a respected adult in the church, a college ministry mentor, or a Christian counselor if there are heavy emotional wounds or questions that feel overwhelming.\n- Encourage faithful practices that invite encounter with God, not just answers: prayer, journaling questions, and worship together (even if she’s unsure about beliefs).\n\n4) Speak truth with grace about core beliefs\n- Reaffirm the gospel gently: God loves you, the good news of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection, and the invitation to know God personally.\n- Acknowledge the reality of pain and doubt: the Bible contains honest cries to God in suffering (Lament Psalms, Job) and also anchors trust in God’s character and promises.\n- Emphasize God’s faithfulness over our certainty: even when we don’t understand, God remains trustworthy (Psalm 33:4; Lamentations 3:22-23; Romans 8:28-39).\n\n5) Conversation prompts you can use\n- “What questions are you most afraid to ask God or us about?”\n- “What would help you feel safe to explore those questions with me?”\n- “If you could see one honest answer from God about this, what would it have to include for you to feel okay with it?”\n- “I don’t expect you to have all the answers. Would you be willing to search for truth with me, even if it changes what you believe?”\n- “What’s one thing about faith you do feel certain about, and one thing you’re not sure of?”\n\n6) A family and church plan for the next 6–12 weeks\n- Week 1–2: Have a heartfelt, low-stakes conversation, agreeing to listen more than argue. Set up a regular weekly check-in.\n- Week 3–6: Read and discuss one question at a time; involve a trusted mentor or counselor if helpful. Consider a short youth-appropriate resource or a book on doubt and faith (chosen with discernment).\n- Week 6–12: Evaluate progress. Are there questions you can own and feel comfortable discussing with others? Is there a place in the church or in a youth group where she can belong even if her beliefs are in transition?\n- Ongoing: Make space for Sabbath-like rhythm and small acts of spiritual practice (family meal with prayer, worship nights, service together) that build shared memory and belonging.\n\n7) When to seek professional help\n- If she expresses ongoing despair, thoughts of harming herself, or extreme hopelessness, gently urge and arrange immediate professional help (a counselor, clinician). Your pastor or church can help coordinate care in these moments.\n- If anxiety, depression, or social withdrawal seems significant, don’t wait to seek help.\n\n8) What you can model as a parent\n- Honesty about doubt in your own life, when appropriate: “I don’t have all the answers, but I’m choosing to seek God and learn with you.”\n- Consistency in love: show up, listen, follow through, and resist manipulation or fear-based reactions.\n- Boundaries that cultivate trust: you can be clear about core beliefs while giving her space to explore and grow into her own convictions.\n\n9) A brief prayer you can share or pray with her\n- Lord, you are patient with us in our questions and our doubts. Please meet [daughter’s name] in her questions and guide her toward truth, love, and life in you. Give me grace to listen well, courage to tell the truth in love, and the wisdom to walk with her whatever path she takes. Amen.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit more about the kinds of questions she’s raising (e.g., about God’s existence, the problem of suffering, church hurt, science and faith, moral questions). I can tailor a short, teen-friendly reading plan, conversation starters, and a week-by-week plan that fits your family and your church context.\n\nAnd know this: many faithful people—biblical heroes included—have walked through doubt and emerged with a more robust, intimate trust in God. God meets us in the wrestling, not merely in the resolution. You’re modeling a hopeful path: to question, to seek, and to remain in relationship with God and with one another. I’m praying for you, your daughter, and your whole family as you navigate this season.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response is strong across theological accuracy, doctrinal soundness, biblical grounding, and nuancing of the issue. It correctly treats doubt as a normal part of faith development, emphasizes love and safety in parenting, and encourages listening, asking questions, and seeking honest answers with Scripture as guidance. It anchors its approach in biblically sound passages (Mark 9:24; Psalms of lament such as Psalm 13 and Psalm 22; Hebrews 11; Romans 8; John 14:6; John 20:29; 1 Thessalonians 5:21; Proverbs 18:15) and recommends trustworthy mentors, pastoral care, and professional help if there are mental health risks. It also models integrity by acknowledging pain, avoiding shaming, and inviting ongoing faith formation rather than demanding certainty.\n\nPotential improvement: explicitly naming 1 Peter 3:15 (as in the Expected Answer) would strengthen alignment with the supplied framework, and a small stylistic tweak (laments rather than 'Lament Psalms') would improve precision. Overall, the guidance remains biblically faithful and pastorally wise."

It offers concrete, implementable steps (structured conversations, reading plan, mentoring, worship/prayer practices) and a clear safety net (watch for despair, provide referrals to counselors). The balance of truth and grace is well maintained, prioritizing authentic relationship, patient listening, and ongoing spiritual formation over premature certainty. Minor caveats relate to the potential overwhelm of a parent navigating many suggestions at once and the need to tailor Scripture choices to the daughter’s actual questions and experiences (e.g., church hurt, science-faith conversations).
