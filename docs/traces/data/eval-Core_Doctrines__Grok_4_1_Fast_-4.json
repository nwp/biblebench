    "expected": "Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both biblical truths held in tension. God is completely sovereign over all things, yet humans are genuine moral agents responsible for their choices. Scripture teaches both that God ordains all things and that humans make real choices for which they are accountable. Different theological traditions emphasize these aspects differently (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), but orthodox Christianity affirms both truths without fully resolving the mystery of how they relate.",
    "output": "### The Relationship Between Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility\n\nIn Christian theology, divine sovereignty and human responsibility are two complementary truths taught throughout Scripture. They form a biblical antinomy—a pair of doctrines that appear in tension to finite human minds but coexist harmoniously in the infinite wisdom of God. The Bible unequivocally affirms **both** without apology or resolution into a single philosophical system, calling believers to hold them in faithful tension. Below, I'll define each concept biblically, demonstrate their scriptural basis, explain their relationship, and note practical implications.\n\n#### 1. **Biblical Definition of Divine Sovereignty**\nDivine sovereignty refers to God's absolute rule, supreme authority, and omnipotent control over all creation, history, and individual lives. Nothing occurs apart from His eternal decree, purpose, or permission.\n\n- **Key Scriptures**:\n  - Isaiah 46:9–10: \"I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, ‘My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose.’\"\n  - Ephesians 1:11: God \"works all things according to the counsel of his will.\"\n  - Daniel 4:35: \"He does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, 'What have you done?'\"\n  - Proverbs 16:4: \"The Lord has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for the day of trouble.\"\n  - Acts 4:27–28: Herod, Pontius Pilate, and the Gentiles did \"whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place\" in Christ's crucifixion.\n\nGod is not a passive observer but the ultimate cause (primary cause) who sovereignly ordains whatsoever comes to pass, including evil actions, which He permits and overrules for His glory (e.g., Joseph's brothers' sin in Genesis 50:20: \"You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good\").\n\n#### 2. **Biblical Definition of Human Responsibility**\nHuman responsibility means that people are morally accountable to God for their thoughts, choices, and actions. Humans possess wills that make real decisions, rendering them culpable for sin and praiseworthy for obedience. Salvation requires personal faith and repentance, and judgment is based on individual response to God's revelation.\n\n- **Key Scriptures**:\n  - Genesis 3:6–13: Adam and Eve freely chose to sin and were held accountable (\"Because you have... you are cursed\").\n  - Deuteronomy 30:19: \"I have set before you life and death... therefore choose life.\"\n  - Joshua 24:15: \"Choose this day whom you will serve.\"\n  - Ezekiel 18:30–32: \"Repent and turn from all your transgressions... For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone... repent and live.\"\n  - John 3:16–18: \"Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed.\"\n  - Romans 3:23; 14:12: \"All have sinned and fall short... So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.\"\n  - Acts 17:30: God \"commands all people everywhere to repent.\"\n\nScripture never excuses sin by appealing to divine sovereignty (e.g., Romans 9 addresses Israel's unbelief but still calls for humility and faith).\n\n#### 3. **The Biblical Relationship: Compatibilism and Divine Mystery**\nThe Bible teaches that God's sovereignty and human responsibility are **compatible**—they operate concurrently without negating each other. This is often called **compatibilism** (distinct from determinism that denies genuine choice). God sovereignly ordains not only outcomes but the desires and choices that lead to them.\n\n- **Explicit Biblical Examples**:\n  | Event | Sovereignty Affirmed | Responsibility Affirmed |\n  |-------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n  | **Joseph's Betrayal** (Gen. 50:20) | God sovereignly planned it for good. | Brothers acted with wicked intent. |\n  | **Christ's Crucifixion** (Acts 2:23; 4:27–28) | God predestined it by His plan. | Men \"lawlessly\" crucified Him. |\n  | **Pharaoh's Hardening** (Exod. 9:12; Rom. 9:17–18) | God hardened Pharaoh's heart. | Pharaoh hardened his own heart first (Exod. 8:15, 32). |\n  | **Judas's Betrayal** (John 13:18; Acts 1:16) | Fulfilled Scripture (Ps. 41:9). | Judas chose treachery freely. |\n\n- **Theological Framework**:\n  - **Primary vs. Secondary Causation**: God (primary cause) ordains all things, but humans act as secondary causes according to their natures (freely willing what they most desire). Sinners choose sin willingly (John 8:34; Rom. 6:20), but their wills are enslaved to sin apart from regeneration (Rom. 8:7–8). In salvation, God sovereignly regenerates (Ezek. 36:26; Eph. 2:1–5), enabling faith as a human response (Phil. 2:12–13: \"Work out your own salvation... for it is God who works in you\").\n  - **No Contradiction in God**: Human logic sees paradox (if God ordains, how are we free?), but Scripture insists both are true. As R.C. Sproul notes, it's not a contradiction but a mystery beyond full comprehension (Deut. 29:29: \"The secret things belong to the Lord... but the things that are revealed belong to us\").\n  - **Major Views** (all affirming both truths):\n    | View | Sovereignty | Responsibility |\n    |------|-------------|----------------|\n    | **Reformed/Calvinist** | God ordains all (including who believes); compatibilist freedom. | Humans act voluntarily; accountable per their choices. |\n    | **Arminian** | God sovereignly elects based on foreseen faith; libertarian freedom. | Genuine free will; resistible grace. |\n    | **Molinist** | God sovereignly chooses a world via middle knowledge of free choices. | Libertarian freedom preserved. |\n\nScripture prioritizes doxology over dissection: \"Oh, the depth of the riches... of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments\" (Rom. 11:33).\n\n#### 4. **Practical Implications**\n- **Evangelism and Assurance**: Preach repentance and faith (human responsibility) while trusting God's electing grace (sovereignty; Matt. 28:19; 2 Tim. 2:10).\n- **Suffering and Sin**: Evil is never God's \"fault\"—He ordains its purpose without authoring sin (James 1:13). Comfort in trials: \"All things work together for good\" (Rom. 8:28).\n- **Holy Living**: We're responsible to obey (1 Cor. 10:13), yet empowered by God's sovereignty (Phil. 1:6).\n- **Warning Against Extremes**: Hyper-Calvinism neglects responsibility (evangelism); Open Theism denies sovereignty (future unpredictability).\n\nIn summary, divine sovereignty guarantees God's purposes prevail, while human responsibility ensures just accountability. Both magnify God's glory: He saves sovereignly, yet receives repentant sinners who respond in faith. As the Westminster Confession states, these truths \"do so far manifest and confirm\" each other. Believers rest in this tension, proclaiming Christ crucified—the ultimate intersection of God's decree and human guilt met by divine mercy (Acts 2:23).

It acknowledges mystery (Romans 11:33) and provides practical implications for evangelism, holy living, and suffering. The main caveat is a potential overstatement about ordaining human desires, which could obscure the distinction between God’s sovereign governance and genuine human deliberation for some readers. Overall, it is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced, with only a minor terminological caveat."

          "explanation": "Overall, the response affirms orthodox biblical teaching on divine sovereignty and human responsibility (compatibilism) and avoids classic heresies. It cites appropriate Scriptures, presents a biblically balanced view, and rejects the notion that sin is to be excused by divine sovereignty. Some minor issues to clarify (not heretical):\n\n- Terminology about compatibilism: the phrase \"distinct from determinism that denies genuine choice\" is imprecise. Compatibilism is a form of determinism that defines freedom as acting according to one’s desires; it does not eliminate determinism, though it reframes freedom. This could confuse readers unfamiliar with the distinction.\n- The statement that God \"ordains not only outcomes but the desires and choices that lead to them\" can read as a strong form of predetermination of inner states. Many traditions prefer to describe God’s concurrence and regeneration that enable faith, preserving genuine human response without implying coercive manipulation of will.\n- While the piece correctly notes varied theological perspectives (Reformed, Arminian, Molinist) as compatible in principle, it could more explicitly acknowledge the ongoing scholarly and pastoral debate about how foreknowledge, election, and middle knowledge interact with human freedom.\n- The use of certain shorthand distinctions (e.g., \"Open Theism\" as simply an extreme) is not heretical per se, but in a fuller treatment it would warrant careful clarification given diverse views on deity's immutability and providence.\n\nNo explicit heresies (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, etc.) are taught here. The content aligns with historic orthodoxy, while a few formulations would benefit from tighter precision in philosophical terminology."
