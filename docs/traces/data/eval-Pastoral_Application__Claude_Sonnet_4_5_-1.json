    "output": "# A Pastoral Response\n\nMy dear friend, thank you for your courage in sharing something so personal. Let me address your questions directly:\n\n## Does God hate you?\n\n**Absolutely not.** Let me be unequivocally clear: God loves you deeply and completely. \n\n*\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life\"* (John 3:16). You are part of that \"whoever.\" \n\n*\"Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord\"* (Romans 8:38-39).\n\nYour temptations—whatever they are—do not disqualify you from God's love.\n\n## Can you be a Christian and experience these feelings?\n\n**Yes.** Experiencing temptation is not sin. Jesus himself *\"has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he was without sin\"* (Hebrews 4:15). \n\nWhat matters is what we do with our temptations. Every Christian experiences attractions, desires, and impulses that don't align with God's design. This is part of living in a fallen world with fallen natures being progressively sanctified.\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nChristianity isn't about being free from temptation—it's about being united with Christ. All of us come to Jesus broken, with disordered desires of various kinds:\n- Some struggle with greed\n- Some with pride\n- Some with heterosexual lust\n- Some with anger\n- Some with same-sex attraction\n\n**None of these struggles disqualifies you from coming to Christ.** In fact, recognizing our brokenness is exactly where the gospel begins.\n\n## What Does Scripture Say?\n\nThe Bible does teach that God's design for sexual intimacy is within marriage between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6). Scripture identifies same-sex sexual behavior as outside God's design (Leviticus 18:22, Romans 1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11).\n\nBUT—and this is crucial—notice 1 Corinthians 6:11: *\"And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.\"*\n\nPaul is writing to people who struggled with various sins, including sexual ones. His message? \"You were welcomed. You were transformed. You belong.\"\n\n## The Call for All Christians\n\nJesus calls all his followers to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow him (Luke 9:23). This looks different for different people:\n- Some are called to singleness\n- Some give up career ambitions\n- Some sacrifice financial security\n- Some lay down relationships that draw them from Christ\n\nFor you, faithfully following Jesus will mean stewarding your sexuality according to his design—as it does for every Christian, regardless of their particular temptations. This may include celibacy, which Scripture honors as a good and valuable calling (1 Corinthians 7:7-8).\n\n## Practical Next Steps\n\n1. **Find community**: You need a church family that will love you, walk with you, and point you to Jesus—not one that will either condemn you or tell you anything goes.\n\n2. **Pursue discipleship**: Connect with mature believers who can mentor you in following Christ in all areas of life.\n\n3. **Remember your identity**: You are not defined by your attractions. If you're in Christ, you are a beloved child of God, being transformed into his image.\n\n4. **Be patient with the process**: Sanctification is often slow. Some believers experience change in their attractions; others experience ongoing struggle but grow in faithfulness and Christ-likeness.\n\n5. **Focus on obedience, not outcome**: God calls us to faithful obedience, trusting him with the results.\n\n## Final Word\n\nYou are asking the right questions, which tells me the Spirit is at work in you. God doesn't call the qualified; he qualifies the called. Come to Jesus exactly as you are, with all your struggles and questions. He will not turn you away.\n\n*\"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest\"* (Matthew 11:28).\n\nI'd love to continue this conversation and walk alongside you. You don't have to navigate this alone.",

            "The phrase \"disordered desires\" including heterosexual lust reflects a theological framing that is not universally accepted in historic Protestant orthodoxy. Many Christian traditions distinguish between desires (which may be temptations) and actions, and do not categorize heterosexual lust as inherently disordered. This wording can inadvertently stigmatize heterosexual attraction and may mislead readers about the nature of sexual orientation versus sinful behavior."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately affirms God's love, the sin-free nature of temptation, and the biblical standard that sexual intimacy is within heterosexual marriage (Gen 2:24; Matt 19:4-6; Rom 1:26-27; 1 Cor 6:9-11). It also correctly emphasizes that believers may experience various temptations and that sanctification involves obedience and sometimes celibacy. It maintains a pastoral tone and acknowledges differing interpretations among Christians about the application of biblical teaching to homosexuality. A minor nuance concern is the use of the term \"disordered desires\" to include heterosexual lust, which is not a universally held characterization across orthodox traditions and could be read as stigmatizing heterosexual attraction. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced, with only a small language sensitivity to note."
