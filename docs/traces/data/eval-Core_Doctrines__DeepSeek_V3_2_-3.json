    "expected": "Original sin is the doctrine that all humanity inherited a sinful nature from Adam's fall. As a result, all people are born with a inclination toward sin and are spiritually separated from God. This doesn't mean infants are guilty of actual sins, but that human nature is corrupted and inclined toward evil apart from God's grace.",
    "output": "Of course. As a systematic theologian, I will provide a clear, biblically grounded explanation of the doctrine of original sin, tracing its biblical foundations, historical development, and key distinctions.\n\n### Core Definition\nThe doctrine of **original sin** describes the universal human condition of sinfulness, guilt, and corruption inherited from Adam as the federal head of humanity. It asserts that because of Adam’s first sin (the \"original\" sin), all human beings are born in a state of spiritual alienation from God, with a nature inclined toward evil, and are therefore subject to both spiritual and physical death.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish two aspects, often termed:\n1.  **Original Guilt (*reatus culpae*):** The judicial imputation of Adam’s first transgression to all his descendants, rendering them legally guilty before God.\n2.  **Original Corruption (*vitium* or *pollutio*):** The hereditary moral corruption of human nature, often called \"concupiscence\" — a disordered desire that leads to actual sins.\n\n### Biblical Foundations\nThe doctrine is constructed from a network of scriptures, primarily:\n\n1.  **The Narrative of the Fall (Genesis 3):** The introduction of sin, shame, fear, and death into human experience through the disobedience of Adam and Eve.\n\n2.  **The Key Theological Text: Romans 5:12-21.**\n    -   Verse 12: \"Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men **because all sinned**.\" The Greek phrase *eph’ hō* has been interpreted in two complementary ways: that all sinned \"in Adam\" (realist or federal view) or \"with the result that\" all sinned.\n    -   Paul's parallel contrasts (Adam/Christ, disobedience/obedience, condemnation/justification) establish the principle of **federal headship**: Adam acted as a representative for all humanity. His sin is imputed to us; Christ's righteousness is imputed to believers.\n\n3.  **Supporting Passages:**\n    -   **Psalm 51:5:** David confesses, \"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me,\" indicating a sinful condition from conception.\n    -   **Ephesians 2:3:** We are \"by nature children of wrath,\" indicating a natural, inherited disposition.\n    -   **1 Corinthians 15:22:** \"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive,\" reaffirming the corporate solidarity in Adam.\n\n### Historical Development & Key Formulations\n*   **Augustine (354–430 AD):** Developed the doctrine in its classic form in debate with Pelagius, who denied inherited sin and asserted human moral ability. Augustine argued that Adam's sin corrupted human nature itself, transforming it from *posse non peccare* (able not to sin) to *non posse non peccare* (not able not to sin). He emphasized original guilt and the transmission of sin through concupiscence in procreation.\n*   **The Protestant Reformers (Luther & Calvin):** Reaffirmed and intensified Augustine's view, emphasizing **total depravity** (that every aspect of human nature is corrupted by sin, though not to the point of utter evil). They stressed that original sin renders humanity spiritually dead and incapable of self-redemption, necessitating sovereign grace.\n*   **Council of Trent (Catholic Response):** Defined original sin as the \"death of the soul\" and a state of privation of original holiness. It affirmed transmission \"by propagation, not by imitation.\" However, it rejected the Reformed view of total depravity, maintaining that while concupiscence remains, baptism removes the *guilt* of original sin, even if the *wound* (*concupiscentia*) persists.\n\n### Major Theological Distinctions\n*   **Original Sin vs. Actual Sin:** Original sin is the inherited state and condition; actual sins are the individual sinful acts that flow from that corrupted nature.\n*   **Original Sin vs. Total Depravity:** Original sin is the cause; total depravity describes the extent of the effect—that sin affects all human faculties (mind, will, emotions) but does not mean humans are as evil as they could possibly be.\n*   **Eastern Orthodox Perspective:** They generally emphasize **ancestral sin**. They focus on the inheritance of **mortality and a corrupted, sickened nature** prone to sin, rather than the imputation of Adam's legal guilt. The primary consequence is death, from which spiritual corruption flows.\n*   **Pelagian & Semi-Pelagian Rejection:** Pelagianism denies original sin entirely, viewing Adam's sin as only a bad example. Semi-Pelagianism holds that humanity is spiritually sick but not dead, and can take the first step toward God apart from grace.\n\n### Implications of the Doctrine\n1.  **Universal Need for Salvation:** It explains why *all* people, without exception, require redemption.\n2.  **The Necessity of Grace:** Salvation must be initiated and accomplished by God's grace, not human merit or unaided will.\n3.  **The Glory of the Incarnation and Atonement:** It underscores why Christ's work had to be both divine (to overcome sin) and representative (as the New Adam).\n4.  **Understanding Human Experience:** It provides a theological framework for the universality of moral failure, suffering, and death.\n\nIn summary, the doctrine of original sin is the sobering biblical diagnosis of the human condition: we are not neutral creatures who occasionally make mistakes, but are born into a state of rebellion and ruin because of our solidarity with Adam. This bleak truth makes the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Second Adam, not merely helpful but absolutely **necessary** for reconciliation with God.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response is strong across major axes. It accurately defines original sin as the inherited condition of sinfulness, guilt, and corruption from Adam, and distinguishes original guilt (imputation) from original corruption (nature’s corruption and concupiscence). It aligns with classic Protestant/Western Orthodoxy (Augustine, Luther/Calvin, Council of Trent) while also acknowledging Eastern Orthodox emphasis on ancestral sin and the non-imputation of guilt. Scriptural grounding is solid: Genesis 3, Romans 5:12-21 (addressing federal headship and imputation), Psalm 51:5, Ephesians 2:3, and 1 Corinthians 15:22 are cited to support key claims. It correctly contrasts original sin with actual sin and touches on related doctrines (pelagian/semi-Pelagian positions, total depravity, necessity of grace), and notes the debates over Romans 5’s eph’ hō phrasing. Nuance is well-captured: it presents multiple historical formulations, clarifies differences between Catholic and Protestant positions (e.g., baptism removing guilt vs. not in all traditions), and highlights common theologoumena. Minor caveats (not treated as errors) include: some use of “guilt” in reference to original sin is more contentious in Eastern Orthodoxy; Psalm 51:5 is interpreted differently by some scholars as not proving original sin in every interpretive framework. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced. "

          "explanation": "The response presents a robust, historically orthodox account of original sin. It accurately covers: universal sinfulness and its consequences; the two classical aspects often discussed (original guilt and original corruption); biblical foundations (Genesis 3, Romans 5); key historical formulations (Augustine; Protestant Reformers; Council of Trent) and major world-Christian perspectives (Eastern Orthodox emphasis on ancestral sin rather than imputed guilt). It also distinguishes original sin from actual sin, and contrasts various positions (Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian, Augustine/Reformers, Catholic Trent, Eastern Orthodox). The discussion of Romans 5:12-21 acknowledges interpretive options (federal headship vs. solidarity with Adam) and avoids a single exclusive reading, which is academically prudent. The text consistently marks differences between traditions rather than presenting one view as universal, and it explicitly warns against heresies like Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Arianism, etc., which is appropriate for a diagnostic exercise. \n\nPossible minor clarifications (not errors) that could improve precision:\n- The claim that Christ’s righteousness is imputed to believers is a hallmark of Reformed theology; some traditions (notably many strands of Eastern Orthodoxy) emphasize infused righteousness rather than forensic imputation, so stating imputation as a universal conclusion should be tempered with explicit note of tradition-wide diversity.\n- The label Original Guilt is contested in some traditions (e.g., certain Catholic and Orthodox formulations emphasize the fallen nature and mortality rather than inherited guilt to the same forensic sense). The text does acknowledge variation, but a more explicit caveat would help in cross-tradition discussions.\n- While the Council of Trent is cited as rejecting the Reformed view of total depravity, a more precise articulation would note that Trent affirms original sin as a privation of original holiness and that baptism removes the guilt; concupiscence remains, but the language of guilt vs. guilt removed can be nuanced across traditions.\n\nOverall, there are no heretical teachings detected in the response; the content aligns with mainstream Christian orthodoxy on original sin and its major historical articulations. The minor clarifications above would help avoid over-generalization across traditions.)"
