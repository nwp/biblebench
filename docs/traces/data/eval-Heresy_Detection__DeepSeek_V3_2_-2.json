    "input": "A preacher claims: 'Salvation is achieved through good works and moral living. If you live a good life, you will earn your way to heaven.' Is this biblical teaching?",
    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "## Analysis of the Theological Statement\n\n**Short Answer:** This statement is **not biblical teaching** and represents a classic heresy known as **Pelagianism** or (in its modified form) **Semi-Pelagianism**, condemned by the early church and contrary to the Protestant Reformation's *sola fide* and *sola gratia* principles.\n\n### 1. **Doctrinal Classification**\n- **Orthodox Position:** Salvation is by **grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone** (Ephesians 2:8–9). Good works are the *result* of salvation, not its cause.\n- **Heresy Identified:** The statement reflects **Pelagianism** (the belief that humans can earn salvation through their own moral efforts without divine grace) or **Semi-Pelagianism** (the belief that human effort cooperates with grace to achieve salvation). Both were condemned at the **Council of Carthage (418)** and the **Second Council of Orange (529)**.\n\n### 2. **Biblical Examination**\n- **Contradicting Key Passages:**\n  - *Romans 3:20*: \"No one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law.\"\n  - *Galatians 2:16*: \"A person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ.\"\n  - *Titus 3:5*: \"He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.\"\n- **Affirming Orthodox Teaching:**\n  - *James 2:14–26* is sometimes cited to support works-based salvation, but orthodox interpretation views this as demonstrating that **genuine faith produces good works**, not that works merit salvation. Faith without works is dead (invalid), but works are evidence, not the ground, of salvation.\n\n### 3. **Historical Condemnation**\n- Pelagius (c. 354–418) taught that humans could achieve salvation through free will and moral exertion. Augustine vigorously opposed this, affirming original sin and the necessity of grace.\n- The Reformation reaffirmed this distinction against medieval Catholic practices perceived as works-righteousness (though historic Catholicism also officially teaches salvation by grace, with works as a necessary response).\n\n### 4. **Theological Implications**\n- **Problem 1:** Denies the **total depravity** or radical sinfulness of humanity (Romans 3:10–12).\n- **Problem 2:** Negates the **substitutionary atonement of Christ**—if we can earn heaven, Christ’s death was unnecessary (Galatians 2:21).\n- **Problem 3:** Turns Christianity into a self-righteous moralism rather than a transformative relationship with God through Christ.\n\n### 5. **Conclusion**\nThe preacher’s claim is **heterodox and dangerous** because it:\n1. Contradicts the core gospel message of grace.\n2. Shifts focus from Christ’s work to human effort.\n3. Can lead either to pride (if one feels righteous) or despair (if one recognizes moral failure).\n\n**Orthodox Correction:** Salvation is a free gift received by faith in Jesus Christ’s death and resurrection. Good works flow *from* gratitude for salvation and the Holy Spirit’s work in the believer (Ephesians 2:10), but they do not *earn* salvation.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer correctly identifies the preacher’s claim as non-biblical and classifies it as Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian works-righteousness. It accurately states the orthodox teaching of salvation by grace through faith, with good works as evidence rather than ground (citing Ephesians 2:8–9 and later Ephesians 2:10 as the purpose-filled outcome). It uses key scriptures (Romans 3:20; Galatians 2:16; Titus 3:5; James 2:14–26) to ground the argument and addresses the distinct roles of faith and works. It also notes historical condemnation (Pelagius, Council of Carthage; Second Council of Orange) and the Reformation emphasis on sola fide/sola gratia. The nuance is respected by distinguishing genuine faith producing works from works earning salvation, and by clarifying the misinterpretation of James. A minor caveat could be a brief caveat about the Catholic doctrinal nuances of justification, but the core message is accurate and well-supported by scripture and history."
