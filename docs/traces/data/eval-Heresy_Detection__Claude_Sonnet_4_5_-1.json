          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies modalism (Sabellianism) as a heresy and explains why it contradicts orthodox Trinitarian doctrine. It articulates the key point that Father, Son, and Spirit are eternally distinct persons who exist simultaneously (not merely sequential modes), and supports this with biblical references (e.g., Jesus’ baptism where the Son, Spirit, and Father are manifested together) and with the Nicene Creed’s framework of three co-eternal, co-equal persons in one essence. It also notes problems such as Jesus praying to the Father and the incarnation, which modalism struggles to account for, and it references the dangers of Docetism. The answer aligns with historic Christianity and is grounded in Scripture and essential doctrinal summaries. A minor potential nuance (e.g., explicit discussion of the immanent vs. economic Trinity) is not essential to answering the question, but could be included for fuller nuance. Overall, the response is accurate, sound, and well-reasoned. "
