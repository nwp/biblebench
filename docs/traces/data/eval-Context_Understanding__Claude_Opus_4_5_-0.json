          "rationale": "The response accurately presents the traditional attribution of the Gospel of John to John the son of Zebedee (the Apostle) and identifies his relationship to Jesus as one of the twelve disciples, including being the Beloved Disciple. It correctly cites key textual anchors (John 13:23 for the Beloved Disciple, John 19:26-27 for Mary entrusted to the disciple) and notes Irenaeus’ testimony and the chain of transmission via Polycarp. It also covers major scholarly perspectives (Johannine community theory, distinction with John the Elder, and debates about authorship and style) and acknowledges the Gospel’s own witness claim (John 21:24). The answer remains relevant, balanced, and nuanced without asserting certainty beyond the evidence. A minor enhancement could include explicit dating (late 1st century) and a brief note on the relative likelihood of single-author vs. multi-source composition, but these are already touched on through the scholarly discussion."
