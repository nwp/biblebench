    "input": "Someone says they believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as taught in the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price alongside the Bible. How does this differ from historic Christian teaching?",
    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "In historic (orthodox) Christian theology, saying “I believe in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit” is normally shorthand for the **Nicene/Trinitarian confession**: **one God** who eternally exists as **three distinct Persons**—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who share **one divine being/essence** (Greek *homoousios*, “of one substance”). Latter-day Saint (LDS) usage of “Father, Son, and Holy Ghost/Spirit” overlaps in language but differs in key meanings, especially as taught in the **Doctrine and Covenants** and **Pearl of Great Price** alongside the Bible.\n\nBelow are the main areas of agreement and departure, stated as fairly as possible.\n\n## Where LDS belief overlaps with historic Christian language\nMany Latter-day Saints sincerely affirm points that sound very familiar to orthodox Christians, such as:\n- The reality and worship of **God the Father** and devotion to Him.\n- The genuine centrality of **Jesus Christ** (His unique saving role is emphasized strongly in LDS devotion).\n- The reality and activity of the **Holy Ghost**, who speaks, sanctifies, comforts, and guides.\n- A desire to be faithful to Scripture (though LDS also accepts additional scripture).\n\nSo the **names** and some **roles** are similar.\n\n## The major difference: “Trinity” vs “Godhead”\n### 1) One being vs three beings\n**Historic Christianity (Nicene):**\n- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are **one God**—not three Gods.\n- They are distinct **Persons**, but **one divine essence**.\n\n**LDS teaching (standard LDS doctrine):**\n- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are **three distinct personages** who are “one” primarily in **unity of purpose, will, and love**, not one in a single shared divine essence.\n- This is often described as a “**Godhead**” rather than a metaphysical Trinity.\n\nFrom the standpoint of historic Christian theology, this is a fundamental departure: orthodox Christianity considers LDS theology **non-Nicene** (i.e., not Trinitarian in the classical sense).\n\n### 2) God’s nature: incorporeal Spirit vs embodied Father and Son\n**Historic Christianity:**\n- God is **spirit** (John 4:24), not composed of parts, not embodied.\n- The Son becomes incarnate in Jesus Christ, taking on a true human nature—yet the divine nature itself is not bodily.\n\n**LDS teaching (explicit in Doctrine and Covenants):**\n- The Father and the Son are said to have **glorified bodies of “flesh and bones.”** (A key LDS text is **D&C 130:22**.)\n- The Holy Ghost is a “personage of spirit.”\n\nThis creates a sharp difference: orthodox theology holds God to be **incorporeal** by nature; LDS theology teaches an **embodied Father** (and an embodied risen Christ in a more literal, ontological sense).\n\n### 3) Eternal God vs “exaltation” and a different divine/human boundary\n**Historic Christianity:**\n- God is eternally God; creatures are eternally creatures.\n- Believers can be “deified” only in the sense of **participation in God’s life by grace** (often called *theosis* in Eastern Christianity), but they do not become gods by nature and do not cross the Creator/creature divide.\n\n**LDS teaching (commonly taught; some elements are framed more strongly in LDS tradition than in the standard works alone):**\n- Humans are God’s literal spirit children and may be **exalted** to become “like God” in a robust sense (often summarized as becoming “gods,” depending on how one defines that term in LDS teaching).\n\nOrthodox Christians generally see LDS exaltation theology as moving beyond historic Christian theosis and into a different model of God and humanity.\n\n### 4) Monotheism as defined by the creeds vs plurality language\n**Historic Christianity:**\n- Strict **monotheism**: one God in being.\n- Any language that suggests multiple gods is rejected as incompatible with biblical-creedal faith.\n\n**LDS scripture and teaching:**\n- Some LDS texts (especially in the Pearl of Great Price and later LDS discourse) use language that can be read as allowing a **plurality** in the divine realm (how that is interpreted varies among Latter-day Saints).\n- Even where LDS insist they worship one God (the Father in the name of the Son, by the Holy Ghost), the overall framework differs from creedal monotheism.\n\nFrom a Nicene standpoint, LDS theology does not match the classical definition of monotheism rooted in “one being” language.\n\n### 5) The Son’s eternal relation to the Father\n**Historic Christianity:**\n- The Son is **eternally begotten**, not made, not a created being (John 1:1–3; Nicene Creed).\n- Father, Son, and Spirit are **co-eternal** and **co-equal** in divinity.\n\n**LDS teaching:**\n- Jesus is divine and pre-existent, but His identity is commonly framed within a broader story of premortal existence and divine sonship that differs from “eternal generation” as used in Nicene theology.\n\n## Another important issue: additional scripture and authority\nYou asked specifically about Father/Son/Spirit, but it matters that LDS belief is grounded in the **Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price** as authoritative alongside the Bible. Historic Christianity—Catholic, Orthodox, and most Protestants—does not accept these as Scripture, and it also rejects the LDS “restoration” claim that historic Christianity fell into a total apostasy requiring new scripture and new prophetic authority. That difference in authority helps explain why the doctrines of God diverge.\n\n## Summary\nWhen a Latter-day Saint says they believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, they often mean:\n- **Three distinct divine personages** united in purpose (the “Godhead”),\n- With the **Father and Son embodied**, and\n- With a broader framework that includes **exaltation** and (in some forms) **plurality** language.\n\nHistoric Christian teaching (orthodox/Nicene) means:\n- **One God in three Persons**, sharing **one divine essence**, eternally and unchangeably,\n- God **incorporeal** by nature, and\n- A firm Creator/creature distinction even in salvation and glorification.\n\nSo the difference is not merely “extra books,” but a **different doctrine of God**—using similar terms while operating with a different underlying theological framework.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response is largely accurate and nuanced. It correctly presents the orthodox Nicene understanding of the Trinity (one God in three co-eternal, co-equal persons sharing one essence) and then clearly delineates how LDS teaching diverges (three distinct personages in the Godhead, embodied Father and Son, Spirit as a personage of spirit). It accurately notes LDS claims about additional scripture (Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price) and the resulting authority difference with sola scriptura, which is a central distinction from historic Christianity. It also highlights important doctrinal tensions regarding God’s nature (incorporeal Spirit vs embodied beings), the eternal relation of the Son to the Father (eternally begotten vs premortal existence and distinct LDS sonship concepts), and theosis/exaltation framework (becoming gods) as a departure from classical Christian anthropology and soteriology.\n\nStrengths:\n- Faithfully contrasts Nicene Trinitarian ontology with the LDS Godhead anthropology.\n- Addresses scriptural authority and canon, not merely the terms Father/Son/Holy Spirit.\n- Notes major points of overlap (worship of the Father, centrality of Christ, Holy Ghost’s role) while flagging the essential doctrinal differences.\n- Provides a structured, nuanced summary of points of agreement and departure.\n\nPossible refinements (not errors):\n- Could explicitly cite key biblical texts for each claim (e.g., Matt 28:19, John 1:1-14, John 4:24 for immaterial God, Heb 1:1-3 on the Son’s identity) to strengthen biblical grounding.\n- Some LDS nuances (e.g., LDS views on unity in the Godhead and the precise nature of ‘gods’ in exaltation) can vary by LDS tradition; the answer treats them fairly but could acknowledge some intra-LDS variation.\n- The statement about “three distinct personages united in purpose” is a common LDS formulation; noting the nuanced LDS language about “one Godhead” that is not identical to classical Trinity could help prevent oversimplification.\n"
