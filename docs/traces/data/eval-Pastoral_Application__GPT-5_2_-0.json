    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "I’m so sorry. When a child says something like that it can feel like the ground shifts under your feet—grief, fear, even guilt can rush in all at once. Take a breath: your daughter’s honesty is not the end of the story. In many cases it’s the beginning of a more real, owned faith. And even when it isn’t, God is not helpless, and you are not alone.\n\n### 1) Start with prayer and steadiness, not panic\nYour fear is understandable, but panic often communicates, “You can’t bring your real questions here.” Ask the Lord for wisdom and tenderness (James 1:5). Remember: God loves your daughter more than you do, and He is able to pursue her even in the wilderness (Luke 15:4–7).\n\nA simple prayer might be: “Lord, keep my heart steady. Help me listen well. Reveal Yourself to my daughter. Give me words that fit, and love that stays.”\n\n### 2) Thank her for telling you—and listen more than you talk\nIf she risked telling you, that’s a sign of trust. You can say something like:\n- “Thank you for telling me. I’m glad you were honest.”\n- “I love you. Nothing you say will make me stop loving you.”\n- “Can you help me understand what you’re feeling and why?”\n\nBe “quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger” (James 1:19). Ask gentle questions:\n- “When did these doubts start?”\n- “Is there something that happened that made faith feel impossible?”\n- “Are your questions more about God’s existence, the Bible, suffering, hypocrisy in church, or something else?”\n- “Do you feel pressured to believe—at home, at church, with friends?”\n\nOften “I don’t believe” is sitting on top of deeper things: pain, disappointment, anxiety, shame, intellectual questions, social pressure, or conflict with a parent. Listening is not agreement; it’s love.\n\n### 3) Separate *doubt* from *rebellion*—and respond accordingly\nScripture recognizes that sincere believers can wrestle: the father who cried, “I believe; help my unbelief!” (Mark 9:24). The Psalms are full of questions and lament (e.g., Psalm 13). Jude even says, “Have mercy on those who doubt” (Jude 22).\n\nIf she’s questioning honestly, treat it like a spiritual and relational conversation, not a courtroom trial. If she’s moving toward patterns that are clearly destructive, you can still respond with calm clarity—truthful, but not harsh.\n\n### 4) Don’t make it about your reputation or your performance\nParents often feel: *What did I do wrong? What will people think?* Those thoughts can quietly turn the child into a project. Remember: salvation is God’s work (Ephesians 2:8–9). Faith cannot be forced; it must be owned. Your calling is faithfulness—love, truth, prayer, and steady presence (Deuteronomy 6:6–7).\n\nIf you need to repent for ways you’ve communicated that Christianity is mainly rules, image, or pressure, do that humbly. Repentance can be one of the most powerful testimonies a teen ever sees.\n\n### 5) Keep the relationship warm and the conversation open\nMake it clear that questions do not end the relationship. Aim for ongoing dialogue rather than one “big talk.” Tell her:\n- “I’m here. We can talk about this as much as you want.”\n- “It’s okay if you don’t have everything figured out right now.”\n\nYour consistent love reflects something of the Father’s heart (Romans 2:4). Many teens need to see that Christianity can handle hard questions without breaking.\n\n### 6) Invite her to explore—without coercion\nYou can offer practical next steps that honor her agency:\n- Read one Gospel together (Luke or John) and talk honestly about what she sees in Jesus.\n- Encourage her to write down her biggest questions; take them one at a time.\n- Offer good resources that respect both mind and heart (books, podcasts, or a trusted mentor).  \n- Ask if she’d be willing to meet with a mature Christian woman—someone calm, thoughtful, and safe—who won’t shame her.\n\nA key point: Christianity is not merely a set of arguments; it’s centered on a Person. If she can keep looking at Jesus, you’re in a hopeful place (John 1:14; John 20:31).\n\n### 7) Pay attention to her whole life, not just her beliefs\nSometimes faith deconstruction is connected to depression, anxiety, trauma, bullying, loneliness, or online influences. Ask about her mental health, friendships, sleep, and stress. If you see warning signs, involve appropriate help—your pastor, a wise mentor, and possibly a licensed counselor (not as a punishment, but as care).\n\n### 8) Model a faith that includes both conviction and humility\nLet her see you:\n- reading Scripture not as a weapon but as bread,\n- praying honestly,\n- confessing sin,\n- loving people well,\n- handling suffering without pretending.\n\nPeter says to be ready to give a reason for hope “with gentleness and respect” (1 Peter 3:15). Teens can smell fear and hypocrisy; they also recognize integrity.\n\n### 9) Keep boundaries, but don’t make church a battleground\nIf she still lives in your home, it’s reasonable to maintain certain family expectations (respect, participation in family life, wise limits around devices, etc.). With church attendance, parents differ; but whatever you decide, keep the goal clear: not “winning,” but shepherding her heart. If she attends, don’t pressure her to pretend. If she resists, don’t let it become daily warfare. Seek counsel for your specific situation.\n\n### 10) Entrust her to God with persistent hope\nSome of God’s most beautiful work happens in seasons of wandering. The Shepherd goes after the sheep. The Father runs to the prodigal. Keep praying, keep loving, keep speaking truth in season, and keep your home a place where grace is real (Luke 15).\n\nA simple, steady pattern:\n- **Daily:** pray briefly for her by name; ask God to reveal Jesus.\n- **Weekly:** one intentional conversation where you mostly listen.\n- **Monthly:** involve a trusted mentor/pastor if she’s open.\n\n### What you might say tonight\n“Sweetheart, thank you for telling me. I’m sure that wasn’t easy. I love you, and I’m not going anywhere. Can you tell me what’s been making faith hard for you? I may not have all the answers right now, but I want to understand, and I want us to walk through this together.”\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a little more: How old is your daughter? Has something happened recently—loss, conflict, a change in friends or school, a church hurt? And when she says she doesn’t know if she believes, is it more intellectual doubts, or more emotional/relational pain?",

It emphasizes: pastoral response to doubt characterized by love, listening, and safety; distinction between doubt and rebellion; the sovereignty and pursuit of God; the sufficiency of God’s grace (Ephesians 2:8–9); the example of Christ and Scripture (1 Peter 3:15; James 1:5; James 1:19; Luke 15:4–7; Mark 9:24); and the reality that faith can be maturely owned over time. It also encourages humility, modeling authentic faith, prayer, and seeking wise mentors or counselors, which are consistent with historic Christian practice for shepherding adolescents facing doubt. It wisely avoids coercion and pressure, acknowledges mental health considerations, and keeps the relationship with the teen central, which is consistent with a gospel-centered, relational approach. It also anchors guidance in sound scriptural principles and key biblical narratives (Psalms, Jude 22, John 1:14; John 20:31).\n\nPossible minor improvements could include: explicitly tying doubt to the gospel proclamation in concrete, age-appropriate ways (e.g., briefly clarifying who Jesus is and why faith in Him remains trustworthy when questions arise), and offering more structured checkpoints for ongoing gospel-centered conversations beyond the broader pattern (daily/weekly/monthly) presented. Overall, the response is strongly aligned with biblical orthodoxy and sound pastoral practice."

          "rationale": "The response demonstrates strong theological grounding, pastoral wisdom, and practical usefulness. It rightly treats doubt as a normal part of faith development, emphasizes God’s loving pursuit, and centers the relationship over performance or coercion. Scripture is used to support concepts like listening, humility, and readiness to give a reason for hope, while also addressing mental health and the need for mentoring and professional help when necessary. The overall approach balances truth with grace, encouraging honest questioning, ongoing dialogue, and lifelong faith formation rather than a single corrective talk. The main strengths lie in empathy, biblically anchored guidance, and actionable steps; minor weaknesses reflect the realities of individual variation in teen experiences and the desire for a wider range of resource options and pacing."
