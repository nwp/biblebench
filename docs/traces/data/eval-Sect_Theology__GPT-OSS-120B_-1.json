    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "**Overview**\n\nWhen a person says that they “believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as taught in the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price alongside the Bible,” they are expressing a theological position that is **Latter‑day Saint (LDS)** in character.  The LDS tradition draws its Christology and pneumatology from a combination of **four canonical books** (the Bible + the three “Standard Works” of the Restoration) and from a body of prophetic teaching that began in the early 19th century.  \n\nHistoric (or “orthodox”) Christianity— the stream that has been articulated in the early ecumenical creeds (Nicene, Constantinopolitan, Athanasian), sustained through the patristic period, the Reformation, and contemporary confessional statements—shares many surface‑level affirmations (the existence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the divinity of Christ, the work of the Spirit) but differs in several **substantive doctrines** concerning **the nature of God, the relationship among the three persons, and the authority of Scripture**.  \n\nBelow is a side‑by‑side, respectful comparison that identifies points of **agreement** and **departure** between LDS teaching and historic Christian theology.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Claims that Overlap\n\n| Aspect | LDS Teaching (as found in the Standard Works) | Historic Christian Teaching |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Affirmation of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** | The “Godhead” consists of three distinct beings: God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost (e.g., *Doctrine and Covenants* 8:27‑28). | The Trinity comprises three persons—Father, Son, Holy Spirit—who are each fully God (e.g., Nicene Creed). |\n| **Divinity of Christ** | Jesus is the literal Son of God, the firstborn of the spirit, who at age 30 was “baptized…as the firstborn of the Father” (Book of Mormon 3 Ne 19:1‑2). He is called “the only begotten Son of God in the flesh” (*Book of Mormon* 3 Ne 15). | Jesus is “the only-begotten Son of God,” “consubstantial” with the Father, true God and true man (cf. Chalcedonian Definition, 451 AD). |\n| **Activity of the Holy Spirit** | The Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit who “testifies of the Father and the Son” (D&C 8:23) and “dwells within” the faithful (e.g., *Book of Mormon* 2 Ne 28:30). | The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father (and, in Western theology, the Son) and indwells believers, sanctifying and guiding the Church. |\n\nThese agreements usually **stem from shared scriptural language** and the common Christian confession that God has revealed Himself in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Doctrinal Differences\n\n### A. **Nature of the “Godhead” vs. the “Trinity”**\n\n| Issue | LDS View | Historic Christian View |\n|-------|----------|--------------------------|\n| **Ontological Unity** | The three are **separate and distinct beings**. The Father and the Son possess **physical, glorified bodies**; the Holy Ghost is a spirit. They are “one” only in purpose, not in substance (see *Doctrine and Covenants* 130:22). | The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are **one in essence (ousia)** while remaining distinct persons. They share the same divine nature; no distinction of material bodies is affirmed. |\n| **Eternal Generation / Procession** | No doctrine of eternal generation of the Son or procession of the Spirit; the Father has always been the Father, the Son was the first-born of the Spirit, and the Holy Ghost is a separate spirit person. | The Son is **eternally begotten** of the Father; the Holy Spirit **proceeds** from the Father (and, in the Western tradition, also from the Son). This is articulated in the Nicene Creed (“one in being with the Father, begotten, not made; ... proceeding from the Father”). |\n| **Subordination** | The Father is **exalted** and “greater” than the Son. Joseph Smith taught that the Son is subordinate to the Father (e.g., *Letter to the Saints*, 1842). | In classical Trinitarian orthodoxy, the three persons are **co‑equal**; any real subordination would imply a hierarchy of being, which the creeds reject. Equality is relational, not hierarchical. |\n\n**Why it matters:**  The historic creeds guard against **modalism** (God appearing in different modes) and **tritheism** (three separate gods). The LDS “three distinct beings” formulation leans toward tritheism in the eyes of traditional theology.\n\n### B. **Additional Scriptures and Continuing Revelation**\n\n| Point | LDS Position | Historic Christian Position |\n|-------|--------------|----------------------------|\n| **Canonical authority** | The **Bible (King James Version)** plus the *Book of Mormon*, *Doctrine and Covenants*, and *Pearl of Great Price* are all equally authoritative (“the standard works”). | The **Bible alone** (Old and New Testaments) is the **closed canon** of Scripture. No later prophetic revelations are regarded as binding for doctrine. |\n| **Nature of revelation** | God continues to reveal truth through modern prophets (e.g., Joseph Smith, Brigham Young) and through ongoing revelation “given for the time” (see *Doctrine and Covenants* 1:1‑2). | Revelation is **completed** in the person of Jesus Christ and the Scriptures; the Holy Spirit illuminates the existing canon but does not add new, equally authoritative texts. |\n\n**Impact:**  Because doctrines such as the nature of God, the degree of deity of Christ, and the possibility of “eternal progression” are primarily derived from the **LDS standard works**, they *depart* from historic Christianity’s reliance on the biblical canon alone.\n\n### C. **Anthropological and Soteriological Distinctions**\n\n| Topic | LDS Teaching | Historic Christian Teaching |\n|-------|--------------|----------------------------|\n| **Human potential / “exaltation”** | Humanity can become **Godlike** and inherit “all that the Father has” (e.g., *Doctrine and Covenants* 132:19‑20). This is called “exaltation” or “theosis” in a literal sense. | **Theosis** (participation in divine life) is understood **participatively** and **non‑ontological**; believers are *made* like God in love and holiness but **do not become gods** in the sense of possessing divine essence. |\n| **Salvation** | Salvation includes **faith, repentance, baptism, Holy Ghost, and “ordinances” performed in temple rites** (including proxy baptism for the dead). It is a **process** that continues after death. | Salvation is **justification by faith** (or a combination of faith and sacraments, depending on tradition) and **sanctification** by the Spirit, completed in this life and fully consummated at the final judgment. No post‑mortem ordinances are taught. |\n| **Nature of Christ’s Atonement** | The atonement is **universal in scope** but **requires individual obedience to additional ordinances** (temple work, sealings) to receive its full benefits. | The atonement is **sufficient for all**; salvation is received by **faith** (with the sacraments viewed as means of grace but not prerequisites for the efficacy of the atonement). |\n\nThese differences influence **how the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are understood in relation to humanity overall ecclesiology.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Summary of Agreements vs. Departures\n\n| Category | Agreement with Historic Christianity | Primary Departure |\n|----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Trinitarian language** | Use of “Father, Son, Holy Spirit” and affirmation of Christ’s divinity. | Conception of three *separate* beings, not one essence. |\n| **Biblical foundation** | Acceptance of the Bible (KJV) as Scripture. | Additional scriptures (Mormon canon) are regarded as **co‑equal** with the Bible, altering core doctrines. |\n| **Role of the Holy Spirit** | Active presence, testimony of the Father and Son, indwelling of believers. | The Holy Ghost is a distinct *personage of spirit* rather than the third person of a single divine substance. |\n| **Authority of Christ** | Christ is the unique Son of God, mediator and Savior. | The Son is **subordinate** to the Father; the Father is “greater” (cf D&C 130). |\n| **Doctrine of God’s nature** | Monotheistic, personal, loving God. | Explicit teaching that God the Father **has a physical, glorified body**, the Son also has a body, and the Spirit is a separate spirit—contrary to the orthodox doctrine of **incorporeal, simple divinity**. |\n| **Revelation** | Belief that God speaks to humanity. | Claim of **ongoing, binding revelation** beyond the biblical canon. |\n| **Salvation/Exaltation** | Faith in Christ leads to eternal life. | Emphasis on **additional ordinances**, *eternal progression* to godhood, and a **different soteriology**. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why Historic Christianity Calls This “Non‑Trinitarian”\n\nFrom the perspective of the historic creeds, the **defining formula** of the doctrine of the Trinity is:\n\n> “We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, **Maker of all things visible and invisible**;  \n>  And in **one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God**, begotten of the Father **before all worlds**, **of one substance** with the Father;  \n>  And **in the Holy Spirit**...\"\n\nKey terms—*one substance* (ὁμοούσιος), *begotten, not made*, *proceeds*—serve to **guard against** the view that the three are **separate gods** or that one is merely a manifestation of the other.  \n\nBecause the LDS tradition **does not accept the “one substance” language**, **identifies the Father and Son as distinct embodied beings**, and **allows for ongoing revelation that reshapes the doctrine**, it is classified as **non‑Trinitarian** by historic Christianity.  The LDS self‑identification as “Trinitarian” rests on a **lexical similarity** (the three names) rather than on the **substantive theological content** of the ancient creeds.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Concluding Remarks (Respectful Tone)\n\n- **Common Ground:** Both traditions profess belief in a loving Heavenly Father, a Redeemer Son, and a comforting Holy Spirit. This shared language can be a bridge for dialogue.  \n- **Essential Divergence:** The *substance* of God, the *relationship* among the three persons, the *authority* of additional scriptures, and the *ending* state of humanity are understood **very differently**.  \n- **Historical Context:** The historic Christian formulations arose from centuries of theological reflection on Scripture, aiming to preserve monotheism while affirming the full divinity of Christ and the Spirit. LDS teachings, emerging in a 19th‑century American religious milieu, restore what they regard as “ancient truths but do so **outside the continuity of the historic creedal tradition**.  \n\nFor anyone seeking to compare these positions, it is helpful to keep in mind that **the same terms can carry distinct meanings**.  When “Trinity” is used in LDS literature, it refers to a **Godhead of three separate personalities**, whereas in historic Christianity it denotes **one God in three co‑equal persons sharing one divine nature**. Understanding the nuance makes respectful conversation possible, while also clarifying where doctrinal boundaries lie.",

            "Minor citation issue: The response attributes the idea that the Godhead consists of three separate beings to D&C 8:27–28. That specific verse is not a clear, primary source for that doctrine; the LDS teaching that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are three distinct beings is drawn more broadly from various LDS scriptures and, especially in practice, from sources like the King Follett discourse and Lectures on Faith, rather than a single verse cited as D&C 8:27–28.",
            "Contested nuance: The claim that Joseph Smith taught the Son is subordinate to the Father is presented as a straightforward fact. LDS sources vary in how they frame “subordination” vs. eternal equality within the Godhead. Many modern LDS theologians emphasize eternal equality and divine unity of purpose rather than ontological subordination; the statement could overstate a point of doctrine.",

In a cautious appraisal, it would be better to note that LDS teaching often derives these points from a range of scriptures and prophetic statements rather than a single, universally agreed verse.",
            "Scope of LDS canon: The response correctly notes the status of the Standard Works as (in LDS teaching) equal in authority to the Bible, but a succinct clarification that this is a distinct doctrinal claim about canon that diverges from historic Protestant sola scriptura would help—without implying LDS canon is merely supplementary to the Bible in all respects."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall the answer is thorough, accurately contrasting LDS Christology, pneumatology, and canon with historic Christian orthodoxy (the Trinity, closed biblical canon, and post-biblical revelations). It highlights critical points of overlap (belief in Father, Son, and Spirit; the divinity of Christ) and difference (Godhead as three separate beings and ongoing revelation via the Standard Works). The main rigor issue is a specific verse attribution (D&C 8:27–28) used to justify three distinct beings, which is not a clean textual basis for that doctrine in LDS literature. The explanation also notes potential tension around the notion of subordination within the Godhead, reflecting a historically contested topic within LDS discussions. Adjusting those points would improve precision, but the core evaluation is sound and well nuanced."

Key Doctrinal Differences\n\n### A. **Nature of the “Godhead” vs. the “Trinity”**\n\n| Issue | LDS View | Historic Christian View |\n|-------|----------|--------------------------|\n| **Ontological Unity** | The three are **separate and distinct beings**. The Father and the Son possess **physical, glorified bodies**; the Holy Ghost is a spirit.
