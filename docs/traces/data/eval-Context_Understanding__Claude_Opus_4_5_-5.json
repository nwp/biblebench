    "output": "# The Purpose of the Book of Revelation\n\n## Primary Purposes\n\n**1. To Encourage Persecuted Christians**\nThe most immediate purpose was to strengthen believers facing persecution, likely during the reign of Domitian (c. 95 AD) or possibly Nero (mid-60s AD). The seven churches of Asia Minor were experiencing various pressures—Roman imperial cult worship, social ostracism, and in some cases martyrdom. Revelation assured them that their suffering was temporary and that God would ultimately triumph.\n\n**2. To Reveal God's Sovereignty Over History**\nThe book demonstrates that despite appearances, God remains in control of human events. The throne room vision (chapters 4-5) establishes this theme—Christ, the slain Lamb, holds the scroll of history and is worthy to open it.\n\n**3. To Call for Faithful Endurance**\nA recurring exhortation throughout is to \"overcome\" or \"conquer\" (Greek: *nikaō*). Believers are urged to remain faithful even unto death, resisting compromise with Roman paganism and emperor worship.\n\n**4. To Unveil the Ultimate Victory of Christ**\nRevelation provides an apocalyptic vision of Christ's return, the defeat of evil (Satan, the beast, the false prophet), final judgment, and the establishment of the New Heaven and New Earth.\n\n## Literary Context\n\nAs apocalyptic literature, it used symbolic imagery familiar to first-century readers to communicate hope while also containing prophetic elements about future fulfillment—a balance scholars continue to interpret in various ways.",

          "rationale": "The answer captures the main aims commonly attributed to Revelation in scholarly discussions: (1) encouragement of persecuted believers, (2) presentation of God's sovereignty over history, (3) exhortation to faithful endurance (nikaō), and (4) unveiling of Christ's ultimate victory and return. It situates the work within its first-century apocalyptic genre and references the likely historical setting (Domitian era) with acknowledgment of alternative possibilities (e.g., Nero) and ongoing debates about date and authorship. The response could be slightly expanded to note broader social critique of Rome beyond persecution, but it already touches on imperial cult pressure. Overall, it directly answers the question with appropriate nuance and relevant context."
