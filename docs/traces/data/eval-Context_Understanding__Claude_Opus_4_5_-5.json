To Encourage Persecuted Christians**\nThe most immediate purpose was to strengthen and comfort believers facing persecution, likely during the reign of Emperor Domitian (c. 81–96 AD). The seven churches of Asia Minor were experiencing various trials, and the book assured them that God remains sovereign and that faithfulness—even unto death—would be vindicated.\n\n**2. To Reveal the Ultimate Victory of God and Christ**\nThe book demonstrates that despite the apparent triumph of evil powers, God's kingdom will ultimately prevail. The repeated scenes of heavenly worship and the final defeat of Satan, death, and evil powers reinforced this message.\n\n**3. To Call for Faithful Endurance and Repentance**\nThe letters to the seven churches (chapters 2–3) contain specific calls to repent from compromise, resist false teaching, and remain steadfast. The book repeatedly emphasizes patient endurance (*hypomonē*) as essential.\n\n**4. To Unveil Spiritual Realities Behind Historical Events**\n\"Apocalypse\" (Greek: *apokalypsis*) means \"unveiling\" or \"revelation.\" The book pulls back the curtain to show the cosmic spiritual battle underlying earthly struggles, particularly the conflict between the Kingdom of God and oppressive imperial powers (often symbolized as \"Babylon\").\n\n## Literary and Theological Function\n\nThe vivid imagery was meant to shape the imagination of hearers, helping them see their circumstances from heaven's perspective and resist the seductive pull of Roman culture and emperor worship.",

          "rationale": "The answer aligns well with mainstream historical/contextual understanding of Revelation. It accurately identifies primary aims often attributed to the book: (1) comforting and encouraging Christians under persecution (commonly dated to the late 1st century, during or around Domitian’s reign), (2) asserting that God and Christ will prevail over evil, (3) exhorting faithful endurance and repentance to the churches (the letters to the seven churches), and (4) unveiling spiritual realities behind political/historical power (often interpreted as a critique of imperial Rome and use of Babylon as a symbolic antagonist). The response also notes the apocalyptic genre’s purpose and the function of imagery to shape readers’ perception from a heavenly perspective and resist imperial cult ideology. Nuance is appropriate (dates and authorship of Revelation are debated in scholarship, and the Domitian-context dating is a common but not universal view). The answer could be improved by explicitly acknowledging authorship and dating debates and by clarifying that Revelation’s larger literary/ritual function includes shaping worship, but these omissions do not significantly undermine factual accuracy or relevance to the question.
