          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns with the core biblical themes of Revelation: Jesus Christ’s ultimate victory, encouragement for persecuted believers to remain faithful, admonitions to churches against compromise, and the disclosure of God’s plan to defeat evil, execute judgment, and establish His eternal kingdom. These aspects are rooted in Scripture (Revelation 1:1; messages to the churches in Revelation 2–3; Christ’s return in Revelation 19; final judgment and new creation in Revelation 20–21). Minor nuances could be added, such as explicit mention of apocalyptic imagery and genre, the blessing associated with reading/keeping the words (Revelation 1:3), and the already/not yet tension often discussed in Revelation interpretation, but the answer correctly reflects orthodox teaching and core biblical grounding."
