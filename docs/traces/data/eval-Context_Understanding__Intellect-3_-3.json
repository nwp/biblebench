          "rationale": "The response accurately reflects the core biblical content: Israelites' slavery in Egypt, deliverance by God, the wilderness journey, and the giving of the Law at Sinai. It aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy that God delivered Israel and established the Sinai covenant. The inclusion of a specific BCE date (13th century) is arguable and contested among scholars, which is the main caveat. The answer is otherwise well-grounded in Scripture and captures the main historical-theological arc of Exodus, though it could acknowledge debates about dating and composition, and mention broader covenantal and liturgical themes (e.g., Passover, tabernacle) for fuller nuance."
