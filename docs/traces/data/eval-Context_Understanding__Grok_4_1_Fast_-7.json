    "expected": "Jesus used parables to reveal truth to those with receptive hearts while concealing it from those who rejected him, and to make spiritual truths memorable through everyday stories",
    "output": "### Primary Biblical Reason\nJesus explicitly explained his use of parables in **Mark 4:10-12** (paralleled in **Matthew 13:10-17** and **Luke 8:9-10**). When his disciples asked why he taught in parables, he replied:\n\n> \"To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, so that 'they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand, lest they should turn and be forgiven.'\" (Mark 4:11-12, ESV; quoting **Isaiah 6:9-10**)\n\nThis indicates a **dual purpose**:\n- **Revelation to insiders**: Parables unveiled profound truths about the Kingdom of God to sincere seekers (disciples and the receptive).\n- **Concealment from outsiders**: They obscured meaning from the hardened or indifferent, fulfilling prophecy and preventing superficial repentance without genuine change.\n\nMatthew emphasizes this as prophetic fulfillment, while Luke stresses understanding for believers.\n\n### Additional Practical and Rhetorical Reasons\nBeyond this theological rationale, parables served key pedagogical functions, drawn from 1st-century Jewish oral culture:\n- **Accessibility and relatability**: Stories from everyday life (e.g., sowing seeds in **Mark 4**, lost sheep in **Luke 15**, prodigal son in **Luke 15**) made abstract spiritual truths vivid and memorable for illiterate audiences.\n- **Engagement and provocation**: They invited listeners to reflect, interpret, and self-examine, often ending with a twist (e.g., Good Samaritan in **Luke 10** challenging ethnic prejudices).\n- **Safety and subtlety**: Indirect teaching avoided direct confrontation with hostile religious leaders (Pharisees, scribes), reducing accusations of blasphemy.\n- **Memorability in oral tradition**: Short, rhythmic narratives (over 30 in the Gospels, ~40% of Jesus' recorded words) aided transmission before writing.\n\n### Historical and Cultural Context\nParables (from Greek *parabolē*, \"comparison\" or \"throwing beside\") were not unique to Jesus. Jewish rabbis (e.g., Hillel), prophets (e.g., Nathan's ewe lamb in **2 Samuel 12**), and wisdom literature (**Proverbs**, **Ezekiel**) used them. Jesus elevated the form to ~46 examples, mostly in Synoptics (John has none as extended narratives).\n\n### Scholarly Perspectives\n- **Traditional/majority view** (e.g., early church fathers like Augustine, modern evangelicals): Parables both reveal and conceal, sorting the receptive from the resistant, as per the Gospels.\n- **Alternative views**: Some scholars (e.g., C.H. Dodd in *The Parables of the Kingdom*, 1935) argue the \"concealment\" motif reflects Mark's theological framing, not Jesus' intent—parables primarily *illustrate* Kingdom ethics. Others (e.g., Joachim Jeremias) see them as \"earthly stories with heavenly meaning\" for urgent eschatological appeal. Form critics note Gospel redaction shaped collections (e.g., Matthew's seven parables in ch. 13).\n\nIn summary, Jesus used parables to reveal Kingdom mysteries selectively, teach memorably, and engage profoundly, aligning with his mission in a divided audience.",

The main factual flaw is the unsupported figure claiming that parables constitute about 40% of Jesus' recorded words, which is not a standard or well-attested statistic. Aside from that, the answer is relevant, covers key points, and appropriately conveys scholarly nuance."
