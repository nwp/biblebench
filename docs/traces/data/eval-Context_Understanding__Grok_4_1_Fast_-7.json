            "Overly binary portrayal: 'reveal to believers while conceal from unbelievers' simplifies the biblical point. Jesus speaks of revealing to those with ears to hear, but the outside world isn't categorically condemned in every instance; understanding can grow (careful with hardening language).",
            "Missed pedagogical nuance: parables also function as memorable, everyday imagery that aids teaching and recall, which the response does not mention.",
            "Nuance about prophecy/hardening: while cited with Isaiah 6:9-10, the relationship between prophetic fulfillment, hardening of hearts, and judgment is more nuanced than a single 'concealment' claim.",
            "Explicit scriptural grounding: would be strengthened by referencing specific passages (e.g., Matthew 13:10-17; Mark 4:11-12; Luke 8:10) to anchor the claim in context."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer correctly identifies a core biblical claim: Jesus used parables to reveal truth to insiders (disciples) and mask it from outsiders, aligning with Matthew 13:10-17 and Isaiah 6:9-10. This aligns with historic orthodoxy and scriptural grounding. However, it is overly concise and lacks key nuances: the pedagogical value of everyday imagery, the gradual unveiling of mysteries to those open to God, and the fuller complexity of the Isaiah quotation. Adding explicit citations and acknowledging the gradual, receptive-heard dimension would improve precision and nuance."
