It correctly argues that the sermon targets committed followers (the disciples) while also functioning as teaching that the crowds overhear and that its ethical instructions have broader applicability for all followers of Jesus. This aligns with common scholarly readings that acknowledge both a primary audience (the disciples) and a broader audience-in-progress (the crowds). The answer could be slightly more explicit about ongoing scholarly debate on how tightly the “you” is scoped (disciples vs. inclusively addressed hearers); however, the core facts and interpretation are solid and relevant to the question.
