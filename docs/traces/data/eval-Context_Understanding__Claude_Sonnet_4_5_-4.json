          "rationale": "The answer accurately identifies the Sermon on the Mount’s immediate audience as Jesus’ disciples, with a larger crowd listening. It uses Matthew 5:1-2 to support the claim that the disciples were the primary addressees while the crowds were present, and Mt 7:28-29 to illustrate that the crowd overheard the teaching. It correctly presents a two-tier audience model (primary/disciples and secondary/crowds) and notes that the sermon assumes a committed following (ethical demands, prayer, etc.). It also aligns with a scholarly consensus that the sermon was directed primarily to Jesus’ followers while being overheard by the crowds. The response is directly relevant to the question and includes textual evidence and scholarly context. A potential nuance for fuller balance would be to acknowledge a wider range of scholarly views on the degree of audience specificity, but the answer already signals this with the two-tier framing and the stated consensus."
