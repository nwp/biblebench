          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the Sermon on the Mount as addressed to Jesus' disciples with the surrounding crowds (as Matthew 5:1-2 indicates, where disciples come to him and he teaches them, while the crowds are also present). This aligns with biblical accounts and historic Christian understanding that the scene involves both a core group (disciples) and a larger audience. The response is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded. Nuance is captured in noting two groups present. However, it adds ethnic shorthand ('Jewish') and overly locational specificity ('in Galilee') that could be refined, since the crowds included people from various regions (and the Gospel notes multiple geographic origins)."
