It acknowledges legitimate disagreement, emphasizes a both/and stance (engagement vs. caution, individuals vs. institutions), and urges distinguishing core Christian values from political strategies. It grounds its stance in biblical precedent but treats political engagement as contextual and principled rather than doctrinally prescriptive, avoiding partisan alignment and explicit doctrinal overreach. This balanced framing aligns with a moderate orientation that respects diversity of views and seeks pastoral prudence in how faith interacts with culture and politics.",
