    "expected": "While 'Jesus is Lord' is foundational (Romans 10:9), orthodox Christianity requires additional essential beliefs about WHO Jesus is. The early creeds developed to combat heresies: Jesus must be confessed as fully God and fully human (against Arianism and Docetism), the Trinity must be affirmed (against modalism), salvation by grace through faith (against works-righteousness), and the authority of Scripture. These essential doctrines form the core of historic Christian orthodoxy.",
    "output": "“Jesus is Lord” is an **orthodox** and profoundly **central** Christian confession—but **by itself, as a bare sentence detached from its apostolic meaning, it is not sufficient to define orthodox Christian belief**.\n\n## 1) Why “Jesus is Lord” is orthodox (and why it mattered)\nIn the New Testament, confessing Jesus as Lord is foundational:\n\n- **Romans 10:9** connects confessing “Jesus is Lord” with saving faith.\n- **1 Corinthians 12:3** treats “Jesus is Lord” as a confession enabled by the Holy Spirit.\n\nIn the early church this functioned as a **baptismal confession**: it marked allegiance to Jesus over against pagan claims like “Caesar is lord,” and it implied worship, obedience, and loyalty.\n\n## 2) Why the phrase alone is not enough to guarantee orthodoxy\nOrthodoxy is not merely a sound slogan; it is the **right confession about the right Jesus**. The same words can be used with radically different meanings. For example:\n\n- An **Arian** could say “Jesus is Lord” while denying Jesus is *fully God* (co-eternal with the Father).\n- A **Modalist/Sabellian** could say it while denying the real distinction of Father, Son, and Spirit.\n- A modern group could say it while redefining “Lord” in a way that denies the **incarnation**, **atonement**, or **bodily resurrection**.\n\nSo the problem is not the phrase, but the fact that **orthodoxy requires the content that gives the phrase its meaning**.\n\n## 3) What else is “essential” for orthodox Christian belief?\nHistorically, the church clarified “what ‘Jesus is Lord’ means” through the **rule of faith** and the **ecumenical creeds** (especially the Nicene Creed and Chalcedon). Core essentials include:\n\n- **The Triune God**: one God in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (against both tritheism and modalism).\n- **The full deity and full humanity of Christ**: Jesus is truly God and truly man (Nicene and Chalcedonian Christology).\n- **The incarnation**: the eternal Son truly became human.\n- **The saving work of Christ**: his death for our sins and his **bodily resurrection** (1 Corinthians 15 treats denial of resurrection as faith-destroying).\n- **The gospel response**: repentance and faith are not optional add-ons but integral to Christian conversion (though traditions differ on how to articulate justification and sacramental incorporation).\n\n## 4) A balanced conclusion\n- If “Jesus is Lord” is used as a **summary confession** that presupposes the apostolic teaching about who Jesus is and what he has done, it is **orthodox** and can be a genuine expression of Christian faith.\n- If it is offered as a **minimal formula** with no further doctrinal content—so that any interpretation counts—it becomes **insufficient to define orthodoxy**, because it can be affirmed by people who deny essential Christian teachings.\n\nSo: **the statement is orthodox, but not sufficient as a stand-alone test of orthodox Christian belief unless its meaning is filled out by the church’s received apostolic doctrine.**",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately treats “Jesus is Lord” as a foundational, orthodox confession that gains its meaning from apostolic teaching. It correctly notes that simply stating the phrase does not guarantee orthodoxy and that historical orthodoxy was clarified by the creeds to affirm the Triune God, the full deity and full humanity of Christ (including incarnation and hypostatic union), the saving work of Christ (including the resurrection), and a proper gospel response (repentance and faith). It also acknowledges the role of Scripture and the rule of faith in underwriting these beliefs. The answer is balanced in distinguishing summary/confessional value from minimal formula, and it avoids endorsing heterodox readings of the phrase. Areas for potential strengthening (not errors) include a more explicit emphasis on Scripture's authoritative role as a criterion for orthodoxy, and a more explicit articulation of exact Chalcedonian Christology language (hypostatic union) and soteriological nuances (e.g., justification by faith, sacramental incorporation) as part of what gives the confession its content. Overall, it aligns well with historic Christian orthodoxy and biblical grounding while remaining appropriately nuanced."
