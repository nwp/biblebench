    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "This statement represents a **heretical** departure from orthodox Christian teaching, specifically falling into the error known as **Pelagianism** or **semi-Pelagianism**, depending on the nuances of the preacher's full theology. Below is a detailed analysis of why this claim contradicts biblical and historic Christian doctrine.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Biblical Doctrine of Salvation: Grace Alone (Sola Gratia)**\nThe foundational Christian teaching on salvation is that it is **entirely a gift of God's grace**, not something earned by human effort. Key biblical passages include:\n\n- **Ephesians 2:8-9 (ESV)**\n  *\"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\"*\n\n- **Romans 3:20, 28 (ESV)**\n  *\"For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight... For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.\"*\n\n- **Titus 3:5 (ESV)**\n  *\"He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy...\"*\n\n- **Galatians 2:16 (ESV)**\n  *\"Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ...\"*\n\nThese passages (and many others) make it clear that **salvation is not earned by good works** but is received by faith in Christ's atoning work.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Role of Good Works in the Christian Life**\nWhile good works do not **earn** salvation, they are the **inevitable fruit** of a genuine saving faith. This is a critical distinction:\n\n- **James 2:17 (ESV)**\n  *\"So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.\"*\n\n- **Ephesians 2:10 (ESV)**\n  *\"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\"*\n\n- **Matthew 7:16-20 (ESV)**\n  *\"You will recognize them by their fruits.\"*\n\nGood works are **evidence** of salvation, not the **cause** of it. A person who is truly saved will produce good works as a result of the Holy Spirit's work in their life (Galatians 5:22-23).\n\n---\n\n### **3. The Heretical Nature of the Preacher's Claim**\nThe preacher's statement aligns with **Pelagianism**, a 5th-century heresy condemned by the early church (e.g., at the **Council of Carthage in 418 AD** and the **Council of Ephesus in 431 AD**). Pelagianism teaches that:\n- Humans are **not inherently sinful** and can achieve salvation through their own moral effort.\n- **Grace is not necessary** for salvation; it merely assists those who choose to do good.\n- **Christ's atoning work is not essential** for justification.\n\nThis directly contradicts Scripture, which teaches:\n- **Total Depravity** (Romans 3:10-12, 23) – All humans are sinful and incapable of saving themselves.\n- **Grace Alone** (Ephesians 2:8-9) – Salvation is a gift, not a wage.\n- **Christ Alone** (John 14:6, Acts 4:12) – No one comes to the Father except through Christ.\n\nA modified form of this error, **semi-Pelagianism**, teaches that while humans are sinful, they can **initiate** their salvation through a free will choice, and then God's grace assists them. This was also condemned by the church (e.g., at the **Second Council of Orange in 529 AD**).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Historical Christian Consensus**\nThe preacher's view has been **universally rejected** by orthodox Christianity across denominations:\n- **Protestantism (Reformation Theology)** – Salvation is by **grace alone through faith alone** (Sola Gratia, Sola Fide).\n- **Roman Catholicism** – While Catholicism teaches that grace is necessary for salvation, it also holds that **meritorious works** (enabled by grace) contribute to justification. However, even Catholicism rejects Pelagianism, affirming that **initial justification is by grace alone** (Council of Trent, Session VI).\n- **Eastern Orthodoxy** – Teaches **synergism** (cooperation between God and man), but still affirms that salvation is **primarily God's work** and that human effort alone cannot save.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Why This Matters Theologically**\nThe preacher's claim undermines the **gospel itself** by:\n1. **Denying the necessity of Christ's atoning death** – If salvation is earned by works, Christ's sacrifice was unnecessary (Galatians 2:21).\n2. **Promoting self-righteousness** – It leads to pride (Ephesians 2:9) and a false sense of security in one's own morality.\n3. **Distorting the nature of grace** – Grace is not a reward for good behavior but an **undeserved gift** (Romans 11:6).\n4. **Ignoring human sinfulness** – Scripture teaches that **no one is righteous** (Romans 3:10) and that **all have sinned** (Romans 3:23).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Correct Biblical Teaching on Salvation**\nThe orthodox Christian position is:\n- **Salvation is by grace alone** (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n- **Faith is the instrument** by which we receive salvation (Romans 3:28).\n- **Good works are the fruit** of salvation, not the root (James 2:17).\n- **Christ's righteousness is imputed** to believers (2 Corinthians 5:21).\n- **God gets all the glory** (1 Corinthians 1:30-31).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: This Is Heresy**\nThe preacher's statement is **not biblical** and represents a **serious theological error**. It denies the **sufficiency of Christ's work**, the **necessity of grace**, and the **doctrine of justification by faith alone**. Historically, this view has been condemned as **Pelagianism**, and it remains outside the bounds of orthodox Christianity.\n\n**Corrective Response:**\nA faithful preacher should instead proclaim:\n*\"Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received by faith in Jesus Christ alone. Good works are the evidence of a transformed life, not the means of earning salvation. No one can boast before God, for it is by His mercy that we are saved.\"* (Ephesians 2:8-10; Titus 3:5)",

This contrasts with the commonly used Protestant formula sola gratia/sola fide. The section also could acknowledge greater diversity within Orthodoxy and Catholic thought on synergism and the role of merits rather than presenting a single uniform statement across traditions."

The rest of the analysis aligns with historic orthodoxy and scripture (Eph 2:8-9; Rom 3:28; James 2:17; etc.)."
