          "rationale": "The LLM’s evaluation aligns closely with biblical teaching and orthodox interpretation. It correctly cites key passages (Matthew 13:11–13; Mark 4:11–12; Luke 8:10) and the Isaiah 6:9–10 fulfillment, explaining that parables reveal truth to those open to it and conceal it from those unreceptive. It emphasizes the use of familiar imagery, the memorable nature of parables, and the private explanation to disciples (Mark 4:34), which are all well-supported scripturally. It also notes that parables provoke reflection and require seeking, which captures an important interpretive dynamic. The response could be strengthened by mentioning that parables also function as a judgment against hardened hearts and that their communicative purpose includes inviting repentance, but these are nuanced extensions rather than corrections of the core points. Overall, the answer is accurate, doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced. "
