    "expected": "Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both biblical truths held in tension. God is completely sovereign over all things, yet humans are genuine moral agents responsible for their choices. Scripture teaches both that God ordains all things and that humans make real choices for which they are accountable. Different theological traditions emphasize these aspects differently (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), but orthodox Christianity affirms both truths without fully resolving the mystery of how they relate.",
    "output": "Brief answer\nDivine sovereignty and human responsibility are both affirmed throughout Scripture and Christian theology: God is absolutely sovereign—He rules, ordains, and accomplishes His purposes—and humans are morally responsible for their choices and will be judged for them. The Bible affirms both truths without resolving fully how they fit together. The proper theological response is to hold them together in biblical tension: deny neither extreme (fatalistic determinism that makes God the author of sin, nor Pelagian/autonomous freedom that removes the need of divine grace).\n\nKey biblical affirmations\n- God’s sovereignty: passages that stress God’s control and decree include Psalm 115:3; Isaiah 46:9–11; Ephesians 1:11; Romans 8:28–30; Proverbs 16:9; Daniel 4:35.\n- Human responsibility: Scripture repeatedly calls people to choose, repent, believe, obey, and will be judged—e.g., Deuteronomy 30:19; Joshua 24:15; Ezekiel 18; Matthew 23:37; Acts 2:23 (Peter holding the crowd accountable for crucifying Jesus, though it was within God’s plan); Romans 1–3 (people culpable for sin).\n- Both together: texts that tightly pair God’s purposes and human culpability include Genesis 50:20 (Joseph: “you meant evil… God meant it for good”), Acts 2:23, and Philippians 2:12–13 (work out your salvation while God works in you).\n\nThe theological problem\nHow can God sovereignly ordain or foreknow all things and yet humans genuinely make moral choices for which they are responsible? Two tensions commonly raised:\n- If God determines every event, is human freedom an illusion and is God the author of sin?\n- If humans have libertarian self-determining freedom outside God’s control, is God’s sovereignty diminished?\n\nMajor theological approaches (short survey)\n1. Classical/Calvinistic compatibilism\n- Thesis: Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are compatible because human choices are voluntary (the agent acts according to desires and nature) even if God decrees or providentially brings about the circumstances and the will. God’s decree is ultimate; human decisions are real and morally significant.\n- Biblical support cited: Romans 9 (God’s sovereign choice), Ephesians 1, Philippians 2:12–13, Acts 2:23.\n- Strengths: Strong emphasis on God’s glory and ultimate control; explains providence and the efficacy of prayer and mission as means ordained by God.\n- Common critique: Critics say it can make God the author of sin or undermine libertarian freedom.\n\n2. Arminian libertarian freedom (classical Arminianism)\n- Thesis: God is sovereign and foreknows all, but He does not deterministically cause every human decision. Humans possess libertarian freedom—genuinely free choices not fully determined by prior causes. God’s foreknowledge does not cause human decisions. Election is conditioned on foreseen faith (in classical Arminianism).\n- Biblical support cited: calls to repent/choose (Deut 30:19; Josh 24:15), texts about God desiring all to be saved (1 Tim 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9), and passages that suggest genuine human initiative in responding to God.\n- Strengths: Preserves human moral responsibility in a robust libertarian sense.\n- Common critique: Raises questions about how God’s exhaustive foreknowledge and sovereign decrees relate to truly undetermined choices.\n\n3. Molinism (middle knowledge)\n- Thesis: God knows not only what will happen (natural knowledge) and what He will do (free knowledge), but also what any free creature would freely do in any conceivable circumstance (middle knowledge). On that basis God sovereignly ordains a world that actualizes certain free decisions without coercing them.\n- Strengths: Seeks to reconcile divine providence with libertarian freedom and God’s meticulous governance.\n- Critique: Controversial among some Reformed theologians; raises deep metaphysical questions about counterfactuals of freedom.\n\n4. Open Theism\n- Thesis: God knows all that can be known, but the future free choices of creatures are not definite facts and so not exhaustively known. God’s relational engagement and dynamic knowledge are emphasized.\n- Strengths: Emphasizes relationality and Scripture’s portrayals of God reacting to human decisions.\n- Critique: Many see it as undermining classical divine immutability and exhaustive foreknowledge; controversial in evangelical circles.\n\nSafeguards and clarifications\n- God is not the author of sin in the moral sense. Scripture denies God tempts people to sin (James 1:13) and frames sin as human rebellion (Romans 1–3). Yet Scripture also teaches God can and does permit, ordain, and harness even sinful acts to accomplish his purposes (Acts 2:23; Genesis 50:20). The distinction between God’s decretive will (what He ordains to come to pass) and His preceptive or moral will (what He commands) is helpful.\n- Freedom in Scripture often means the capacity to act voluntarily according to one’s desires (compatibilist sense), but many theologians also affirm libertarian freedom for moral responsibility—this is where theological systems diverge.\n- Both God’s sovereignty and human responsibility are taught repeatedly; reducing one to the other does violence to Scripture.\n\nPractical and pastoral implications\n- Assurance: God’s sovereignty gives comfort—nothing ultimately frustrates His purposes (Romans 8:28). Believers can rest in God’s wise governance.\n- Urgency of mission and obedience: Human responsibility grounds evangelism, prayer, repentance, and obedience. We are commanded to act and will bear responsibility (Matthew 28:18–20; Acts 1:8).\n- Humility and trust: The tension should cultivate humility—trust God’s wisdom and work while diligently exercising our responsibility.\n- Prayer and means: Scripture teaches God uses means (preaching, sacraments, prayer) to accomplish His ends; Christians should both pray in dependence and work in responsibility (Philippians 2:12–13).\n\nHow to hold the tension\n- Begin with Scripture: affirm all biblical teachings even if we cannot fully reconcile them philosophically.\n- Reject irresponsible extremes: avoid fatalism (which makes God the author of sin) and avoid views that make human freedom autonomous from God’s sustaining grace.\n- Live accordingly: pray, witness, obey, and trust God’s control.\n\nSummary\nBiblically and theologically, divine sovereignty and human responsibility are complementary truths. God is the sovereign Lord who ordains and accomplishes His will in history; humans are morally responsible agents who must choose, repent, believe, and obey. Various theological models (compatibilism, Arminianism, Molinism, Open Theism) try to explain how these truths fit together; none fully removes the mystery. The faithful posture is to affirm both truths, avoid caricatures, and act in obedience, trust, and humble dependence on God’s wisdom and grace.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns well with orthodox Christian teaching on divine sovereignty and human responsibility. It accurately states that Scripture presents both God’s sovereign ordination/providence and genuine human responsibility, and it avoids collapsing one into the other or denying either. It surveys major classical positions ( Calvinist compatibilism, Arminian libertarian freedom, Molinism, Open Theism) with concise summaries and typical strengths/criticisms, which reflects standard scholarly and pastoral understandings. It provides appropriate safeguards (e.g., God is not the author of sin; distinction between decretive and preceptive will) and practical implications, highlighting mystery and the need for humility. Scripture references cited are representative of the points made (e.g., Romans 8:28–30; Ephesians 1:11; Acts 2:23; Genesis 50:20; Philippians 2:12–13; James 1:13). Minor caveats exist primarily in the level of technical nuance (e.g., precise formulations within Arminian or Molinist schools can vary), and Open Theism remains controversial in many evangelical circles. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced in handling the tension between sovereignty and responsibility."
