          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the group’s teaching as Gnosticism and explains why it contradicts core Christian doctrines. It accurately contrasts salvation by faith in Christ (not secret knowledge) with the Gnostic emphasis on gnosis for salvation, affirms the goodness of creation (Genesis 1) and the incarnation, and defends the bodily resurrection as essential to Christian hope. Scriptural grounding is solid, citing key anti-Gnostic themes in 1 John 4:2-3, Colossians 2:8, and 1 Timothy 6:20, and it references John 3:16 and Ephesians 2:8-9 to support orthodox salvation faith. The response also notes the historical confrontation with Gnosticism by early Church Fathers. Nuance is largely adequate, though it could acknowledge greater diversity within Gnostic systems (some variants emphasized different aspects of salvation and matter), which would provide a slightly more robust acknowledgment of theological variety within the heresy. Overall, the analysis is doctrinally orthodox, biblically anchored, and captures the main theological distinctions with appropriate nuance."
