    "expected": "This teaching conflicts with the orthodox Christian doctrine of salvation by grace through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28). While orthodox Christianity acknowledges that genuine faith produces good works and obedience (James 2:17), it teaches that salvation is received as a free gift through faith in Christ's finished work, not earned through human effort or religious rituals. The LDS concept of exaltation through temple ordinances (endowment, celestial marriage, etc.) adds requirements beyond what Scripture teaches and represents a works-based salvation system that contradicts the biblical gospel of grace.",

            "The 'Orthodox Christian Teaching' section presents justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) as if it universally characterizes Orthodox (Eastern Orthodox) doctrine. In reality, Eastern Orthodoxy emphasizes synergy with grace and theosis (divinization) through faith, baptism, and ongoing participation in the sacraments. The simplification risks misrepresenting non-Protestant orthodoxy.",
            "Hebrews 7:25 is used to claim sufficiency of Christ's atonement; while biblical, the verse speaks primarily to Christ's ongoing priestly intercession and ability to save, rather than detailing the full mechanics of salvation (atonement, grace, faith, and cooperation with grace). This is a simplification, not a deal-breaker, but worth noting.",
            "The response treats 'salvation' and 'exaltation' as largely synonymous in LDS teaching. In LDS theology, 'salvation' and 'exaltation' are distinct concepts (salvation often refers to being saved from sin and death; exaltation refers to eternal life with God and the fullness of joy), and temple ordinances are specifically tied to exaltation. The analysis would be clearer if it distinguished these LDS distinctions more explicitly to avoid conflating stages of salvation."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM response correctly identifies major points of divergence between a LDS soteriology (faith plus ordinances and ongoing obedience) and a grace-based, faith-justified gospel. It provides biblical anchors and notes where orthodox Christian emphasis lies (grace, faith, and works as fruit, not prerequisite). The main strengths are clarity about the core disagreement and the inclusion of scriptural references. The main area needing improvement is a more precise representation of non-Protestant orthodoxy (Eastern Orthodoxy and Catholicism do not subscribe to 'justification by faith alone'), and greater clarity on the LDS distinction between salvation and exaltation, as well as a nuanced treatment of Hebrews 7:25 within its broader biblical context."
