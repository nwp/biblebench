    "expected": "The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became human, lived a perfect life, died on the cross as a substitute for sinners, rose from the dead, and now offers salvation and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe in him. It proclaims that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, not earned by human effort, received through faith in Christ alone.",
    "output": "Speaking as a systematic theologian, I define the **Gospel** (from the Greek *euangelion*, meaning \"good news\") not merely as religious advice or a moral system, but as the historical announcement of what God has accomplished through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ to redeem a fallen world and reconcile sinners to Himself.\n\nIn systematic theology, we often structure the Gospel through four distinct movements: **God, Man, Christ, and Response.**\n\n### 1. God: The Holy Creator and Righteous Judge\nThe Gospel begins not with human need, but with God’s glory. There is one God, the Creator of all things, who is perfectly holy, just, and loving (Genesis 1:1; Isaiah 6:3). Because He created us, He owns us, and He has the rightful authority to tell us how to live. He created humanity to know Him, enjoy Him, and reflect His glory (Psalm 19:1).\n\n### 2. Man: The Fallen Rebel\nThe \"bad news\" is necessary to understand the \"good news.\" Humanity, represented by Adam, rebelled against God’s authority, choosing autonomy over obedience (Genesis 3). In theology, we call this **The Fall**.\n\nAs a result:\n*   **We are sinful by nature and choice:** We do not merely make mistakes; we are spiritually dead and inclined toward rebellion (Ephesians 2:1–3; Romans 3:10–12).\n*   **We are separated:** Our sin creates a barrier between us and a Holy God (Isaiah 59:2).\n*   **We are condemned:** Because God is just, He cannot overlook evil. The wage of sin is death—both physical and eternal separation from God under His just wrath (Romans 6:23; John 3:36).\n\nWe are utterly incapable of fixing this problem through our own morality, religion, or good works.\n\n### 3. Christ: The Substitute and Victor\nThis is the core of the Gospel. Because we could not go up to God, God came down to us.\n*   **The Incarnation:** God the Son took on human flesh in the person of Jesus Christ. He is fully God and fully man (John 1:14; Colossians 2:9).\n*   **His Perfect Life (Active Obedience):** Jesus lived the act of perfect obedience that we failed to live, fulfilling the Law of God completely without sin (Hebrews 4:15).\n*   **His Sacrificial Death (Passive Obedience):** On the cross, Jesus acted as a substitute. Theologians refer to this as **Penal Substitutionary Atonement**. He took the penalty we deserved and absorbed the wrath of God in our place (2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Peter 3:18). At the cross, God’s justice (punishing sin) and love (saving the sinner) perfectly met.\n*   **His Resurrection:** Three days later, Jesus rose bodily from the grave. This vindicated His claims, proved the penalty was paid in full, and defeated death (1 Corinthians 15:3–4; Romans 4:25).\n\n### 4. The Response: Repentance and Faith\nThe Gospel is a proclamation that demands a response. The benefits of Christ’s work—forgiveness of sin and the credit of His righteousness—are not automatic. They are applied to the individual solely by **grace** through **faith**.\n*   **Repentance:** A turning away from sin and the idol of self-rule (Acts 3:19).\n*   **Faith:** A turning toward Jesus, trusting in Him alone for salvation rather than one's own efforts (Ephesians 2:8–9).\n\nWhen a person trusts in Christ, the theological event of **Justification** occurs: God legally declares the sinner \"righteous\"—not because they are perfect, but because Christ's righteousness is imputed (credited) to their account (Romans 3:24–26).\n\n### Summary\nThe Gospel is the news that **Jesus Christ died for our sins and was raised for our justification**, so that there is now no condemnation for those who are in Him. It is the announcement that the Kingdom of God has broken into history, offering rebels full pardon, adoption into God’s family, and the sure hope of the resurrection and the New Creation.\n\n> *\"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures.\"* — **1 Corinthians 15:3–4**",

          "errors": [],
          "rationale": "The LLM response presents a robust, orthodox articulation of the gospel. It correctly describes the gospel as: God’s creation, humanity’s fall, Christ’s incarnation, life, substitutionary death, and bodily resurrection, followed by a response of repentance and faith received by grace, resulting in justification and reconciliation with God. Scriptural backing is evident throughout (e.g., Gen 1:1; Isa 6:3; Rom 3:10–12; Rom 6:23; John 3:36; Matt 1:23; Heb 4:15; 2 Cor 5:21; 1 Pet 3:18; 1 Cor 15:3–4; Eph 2:8–9; Rom 3:24–26). It also explicitly treats justification by faith and imputed righteousness, and includes important elements such as active obedience (fulfillment of the law) and penal substitutionary atonement, followed by the resurrection and the eschatological hope (adoption, new creation). These align with historic Protestant orthodoxy and are biblically grounded when understood within that framework. Nuances are well-handled: distinctions between God’s justice and love at the cross, the roles of repentance and faith, and the functional role of grace are clearly stated. \n\nPotential caveats (minor):\n- The response foregrounds penal substitutionary atonement and imputed righteousness as the primary framework. While widely held in historic Protestant orthodoxy, some Christian traditions (e.g., certain Catholic, Orthodox, or other atonement models like Christus Victor or moral influence) emphasize different emphases. This is not a doctrinal error, but a scope note. \n- A few formulations (e.g., “the wage of sin is death—physical and eternal separation”) reflect biblical language, yet the biblical data on death and wrath can be nuanced (spiritual death, divine wrath, etc.). Overall, these nuances are within acceptable evangelical interpretation."

          "explanation": "Assessment: The response presents orthodox, historic Christian gospel consistent with Nicene/Chalcedonian Christology and Reformation-era soteriology. It affirms: one holy Creator God; human fall and need for salvation; the person and work of Christ (incarnation, perfect obedience, penal substitutionary atonement, resurrection); justification by grace through faith; repentance and faith as proper response; and preservation from condemnation for those in Christ. It explicitly rejects common heresies (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism) and summarizes the core gospel message well. Minor caveats (not doctrinal errors, but notes of emphasis): - The piece does not explicitly spell out the Trinity or the Holy Spirit, which could be seen as an omission rather than an error. - It foregrounds Penal Substitutionary Atonement; while this is a traditional view, other Christian traditions emphasize alternative atonement motifs (e.g., Christus Victor, Moral Influence); again, this is a matter of emphasis rather than a heresy. - The use of imputed righteousness aligns with Reformed soteriology; some traditions teach infused righteousness rather than imputation; this represents doctrinal variance, not heresy. Overall assessment: severity of potential error is none."
