          "rationale": "The answer correctly identifies that the Sermon on the Mount was delivered to Jesus' disciples and the crowds that followed him, and it places the event in Galilee, aligning with Matthew 5:1. This corresponds to the commonly taught view that both the disciples and the broader crowd were present. The inclusion of 'Galilee' is accurate. The response is slightly hampered by a stray typographical element ('that.') and a wording choice that could be read as overly exclusive to Jews; more precise phrasing would acknowledge that the audience consisted of the disciples and the crowds, which included a broader mix beyond strictly Jewish listeners in the biblical account. Overall, the content is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced enough for the question. "
