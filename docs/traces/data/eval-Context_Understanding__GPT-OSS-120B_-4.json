    "output": "**Short answer**  \nThe Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5‑7) was spoken by Jesus to the mixed crowd that had gathered around him in the vicinity of the “mount” in Galilee—most immediately to his own disciples and to the larger group of Jewish listeners who were following his ministry. Because Matthew’s gospel was written later for a predominantly **Jewish‑Christian** community, the sermon is also addressed, in a literary‑theological sense, to that community as a whole, presenting a “new‑type” interpretation of the Law for the emerging kingdom of God.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Immediate historical setting\n\n| Element | Evidence from the text | What it tells us about the hearers |\n|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Location** | “When Jesus saw the crowds … he went up on a **mount**” (Matt 5:1) | The mount is identified with the Galilean landscape where Jesus’ public ministry was concentrated (cf. Mark 1:35; Luke 6:1). His audience would have been the local Galilean Jews who regularly came to hear him. |\n| **“Seeing the crowds”** (Matt 5:1) | The Greek *ὄχλον* (ochlon) denotes a sizable, heterogeneous group, not just a private circle of disciples. | The sermon was delivered to both his inner followers and the larger public that gathered to hear his teaching. |\n| **“His disciples”** (Matt 5:2) | Immediately after the opening, Jesus “began to teach them.” The Greek *μαθηταί* (mathētai) refers to those who had already committed to following him. | The disciples constitute a core audience, but the surrounding crowd was also present and would have heard the teaching. |\n| **References to the Law and Prophets** | “You have heard that it was said … but I say to you…” (Matt 5:21‑48). | Jesus is addressing a Jewish audience familiar with the Torah; the formula “You have heard… but I say to you” signals a reinterpretation of the Mosaic Law for people who respect that tradition. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. The “authorial” audience in Matthew’s Gospel\n\n### 2.1 Who Matthew was writing for\n\n* **Jewish‑Christian orientation** – The opening of Matthew (Matt 1:1) begins with a genealogy that stresses Jesus’ Davidic and Abrahamic credentials, a concern typical of a community that wanted to prove its continuity with Israel.\n* **Use of “Law” terminology** – Matthew repeatedly presents Jesus as the fulfillment of the Law (Matt 5:17), a theme that would be most meaningful to readers who still valued the Torah.\n* **Frequent reference to “the kingdom of heaven”** – The term is a purposely Jewish circumlocution for “kingdom of God,” suggesting the author expected his readers to understand the Jewish theological backdrop.\n\nConsequently, while the **immediate hearers** were the Galilean crowd and the disciples, the **intended long‑term audience** of the sermon, as presented in the Gospel, is the **Jewish‑Christian community** that Matthew addresses with his written work.\n\n### 2.2 How the sermon functions for that community\n\n1. **Re‑defining discipleship** – The Beatitudes (Matt 5:3‑12) set the ethic for those who belong to the “kingdom of heaven.”\n2. **Ethical revision of the Torah** – By recasting commandments (e.g., “You shall not murder” → “anger is liable to judgment”), the sermon offers an interiorized, heart‑oriented righteousness that the community could claim as its distinctive identity.\n3. **Soteriological encouragement** – The “golden rule” (Matt 7:12) and the final exhortation (Matt 7:24‑27) underscore that the audience should **build their lives on Jesus’ teachings**, a clear call to the community as a whole.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Scholarly perspectives on the primary audience\n\n| Viewpoint | Core claim | Supporting points | Notes |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|\n| **Traditional/majority view** (e.g., Keener, France) | Immediate audience = **disciples + surrounding Jewish crowd**; literary audience = **Jewish‑Christian believers**. | • The narrative context (Matt 5:1‑2) <br>• Use of Torah language<br>• Matthew’s overall Jewish‑Christian orientation | The two‑layered audience model is widely accepted. |\n| **Eschatological/primordial community view** (e.g., N. T. Wright, R. T. France in some works) | Primary address = **the “kingdom” community that will be formed**; the sermon is a vision for a future, eschatological people, not just a historical crowd. | • “Kingdom of heaven” theme<br>• “Blessed are the poor in spirit” as a reference to the imminent reign of God | This view emphasizes the sermon’s forward‑looking purpose but does not deny the historical listeners. |\n| **Redaction‑critical view** (e.g., Dale C. Allison Jr., John P. Meier) | The sermon is a **composite of sayings** drawn from various occasions; its “primary audience” is the **Matthean community** that needed a coherent teaching on discipleship. | • Differences in style within Matt 5‑7<br>• Possible borrowing from Q and from oral tradition | Highlights the editorial shaping of material for a later audience. |\n| **Rhetorical‑sociological view** (e.g., Ben Witherington III) | Audience = **both the immediate Galilean listeners and the broader “Jewish audience of the world”** who would later read the gospel; the mount setting is a symbolic “mountain of the law” referencing Sinai. | • The mountain analogy (Moses on Sinai vs. Jesus on a mount)<br>• Appeal to “all who hear” (Matt 7:28) | Presents the sermon as a public proclamation to a universal (Jewish) audience. |\n\n**Consensus:** Scholars agree that the **immediate hearers** were the Galilean crowd (including the disciples) and that the **author’s intended readership**—as the Gospel was composed—was a **Jewish‑Christian community**. The sermon therefore functions on two levels: a real‑time ethical teaching and a lasting theological charter for the nascent church.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Key take‑aways\n\n1. **Immediate listeners** – Jesus addressed his disciples and the larger Jewish crowd that had gathered around him while he was teaching on a mountain in Galilee (Matt 5:1‑2). Their cultural background was thoroughly Jewish; they knew the Torah and expected a teacher who would speak within that tradition.\n2. **Literary audience** – Matthew writes for a **Jewish‑Christian community** seeking to define itself in relation to the Law and to the promises of Israel. The Sermon on the Mount is presented as the definitive ethical teaching for that community.\n3. **Dual‑layered purpose** – The sermon simultaneously offers:\n   * **Practical instruction** for the people standing before Jesus, and\n   * **Theological formation** for the later readers who would view the text as the “new law” of the kingdom.\n4. **Alternative emphases** – Some scholars highlight the eschatological or redactional dimensions, but these do not overturn the basic historical fact that the original speech was delivered to a **Jewish audience** in Galilee.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount was the **Jewish crowd—including Jesus’ disciples—who were gathered around him on the Galilean mount**. In the Gospel of Matthew this teaching is also directed, in a literary sense, to the **Jewish‑Christian community for whom the gospel was written**, presenting the sermon as the ethical foundation of the “kingdom of heaven.”",
