    "output": "**Short answer**\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5‑7) was spoken primarily to **Jesus’ own disciples** who were gathered with a larger crowd of Jewish listeners.  In the context of Matthew’s Gospel the teaching is presented as the foundational instruction for the new “kingdom‑of‑heaven” community—the early Jewish‑Christian church—to which the Gospel itself is addressed.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the text itself says\n\n| verse | Greek/English note | Implication for audience |\n|------|--------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Matt 5:1‑2** | “When He saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain; and when He was seated, His disciples came to Him; and He opened His mouth, and taught them, saying …” | The **immediate listeners** are the **disciples** (“αὐτοῦ τοὺς μαθητὰς”). The crowd is mentioned first, but the teaching is directed to the disciples. |\n| **Matt 5:3‑12** (Beatitudes) | The “blessed” are described in terms that would resonate with **Jewish‑suffering‑theology** (the poor, mourners, the meek, etc.). | The **primary audience** is therefore a Jewish group familiar with the Psalms and Torah’s prophetic language. |\n| **Matt 7:28‑29** | “When Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were amazed …” | The **secondary audience** is the assembled crowd, whose reaction shows that the teaching had a public impact. |\n\nThus the **inner circle** (the disciples) receives the systematic instruction, while the **outer circle** (the crowd) witnesses it and is invited into the same ethic.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Who the Gospel of Matthew was written for\n\n* **Historical setting:** Most scholars date Matthew to the **late 1st‑early 2nd century** (c. 80‑95 CE), written for a **Jewish‑Christian audience** in the diaspora (perhaps Antioch or the broader Roman‑Greek world).  \n* **Purpose of the Sermon in Matthew:** It functions as a **“new law”** (cf. Matt 5:17‑20) for this community, positioning them as the true heirs of the covenant—**“the people of the kingdom”** (Matt 5:13‑16).  \n* Consequently, while the **immediate listeners** were the disciples on the mountain, the **larger intended readership** (and thus the *primary audience* for whom the sermon was composed) is the **Jewish‑Christian church** that Matthew addresses throughout his Gospel (see the opening “назначение” in Matt 1:1‑17 and the frequent “you” statements).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Scholarly consensus\n\n| Scholar / School | View of the primary audience |\n|------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Traditional/majority view** (e.g., B. Wright, D. Stuart) | The sermon was spoken to **Jesus’ first‑generation disciples**, who were mostly **Jewish followers**. Matthew presents it as a teaching for the entire new community. |\n| **Redaction‑critical scholars** (e.g., R. Wright, N. Rogers) | Matthew reshapes the material to speak **directly to his own community**—the **Jewish‑Christian Church** confronting issues of law‑observance, sectarian identity, and persecution. |\n| **Form‑critical perspective** (e.g., H. Barton) | The *Sermon on the Mount* is a **literary compilation** of Jesus’ sayings that serves as a **“teaching collection”** for the early church; its “primary audience” is therefore the **faith community** for whom the collection was assembled, not a single historic hearing. |\n| **Minority/critical view** (e.g., G. Ehrman) | Some argue the sermon may never have been delivered in one sitting; it is a **Matthean invention** addressed **exclusively to the Gospel’s readers** as a catechetical guide. |\n\nEven the “critical” positions recognize that **the disciples** function as the **representative audience**—the group to whom the ethical demands are first articulated, and through whom the teachings would be passed to the wider community.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Key points to remember\n\n1. **Immediate audience:** The **disciples** (the twelve and other close followers) gathered with a larger crowd (Matt 5:1‑2).  \n2. **Broader historic audience:** The **Jewish listeners** of Galilee who had just heard John the Baptist and were expecting the Messiah.  \n3. **Literary‑theological audience:** The **Jewish‑Christian community** that Matthew writes for—those seeking to understand how Jesus fulfills, deepens, or supersedes the Mosaic Law.  \n4. **Purpose of the sermon:** To lay out the **ethics of the Kingdom of Heaven** for that community, presenting a **new covenant ethic** that would define the identity of the early church.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Primary immediate audience:** **Jesus’ disciples**—the inner circle of his followers present on the mountain.  \n- **Primary intended audience (as Matthew’s Gospel frames it):** The **Jewish‑Christian church** reading Matthew, for whom the sermon operates as the foundational “new law” of the Kingdom.  \n\nBoth strands are reflected in the text: the disciples hear the direct instruction; the surrounding crowd (and later readers) are called to adopt the same kingdom‑principles. This dual‑level audience is why the Sermon on the Mount has been read both as a historical teaching event and as a timeless catechetical discourse for the Christian community.",

The main factual risk is a misstatement about a textual 'designation' in Matt 1:1–17 and some questionable scholar-attribution the table uses; otherwise the response aligns well with standard scholarly understandings of audience and Matthew’s purpose."
