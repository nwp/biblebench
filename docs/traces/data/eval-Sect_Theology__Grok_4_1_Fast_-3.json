    "expected": "LDS theology teaches that Jesus and Lucifer (Satan) are spirit brothers, both created by God the Father in a pre-mortal existence. This is incompatible with orthodox Christianity for several reasons: (1) Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17 says all things were created through him); (2) Jesus is worshiped as God (Hebrews 1:6) while Satan is a fallen angel; (3) This teaching diminishes Christ's unique divine nature and blurs the absolute distinction between the Creator and creation. Orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus as the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity, while Satan is a created angelic being who rebelled.",
    "output": "### Latter-day Saint (LDS) View of the Relationship Between Jesus and Lucifer\n\nIn Latter-day Saint theology, Jesus Christ (identified as Jehovah in pre-mortal contexts) and Lucifer (who became Satan) are regarded as **spirit brothers**, both being literal spirit children of God the Father (Heavenly Father) and a heavenly mother. This stems from LDS teachings about a pre-mortal existence where all humans, including Jesus and Lucifer, existed as spirit offspring of God before birth on earth.\n\nKey sources include:\n- **Pearl of Great Price** (Moses 4:1-4; Abraham 3:22-28): Describes a \"council in heaven\" where Jesus volunteered to be the Savior under the Father's plan, while Lucifer (Satan) proposed an alternative plan of forced obedience, leading to a war in heaven. Both are depicted as noble spirit beings vying for leadership, with one-third of the spirits (including Lucifer) rebelling and being cast out.\n- **Teachings of LDS prophets**: Joseph Smith taught that \"the devil was once an angel in authority in the heavens\" and that Jesus and Lucifer were \"brothers\" (e.g., *Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith*, p. 357). Later leaders like Brigham Young and modern manuals (e.g., *Gospel Principles*, ch. 4) affirm that Jesus was the \"firstborn\" spirit child, making Lucifer his spirit brother by lineage.\n\nLDS doctrine emphasizes that Jesus, as the firstborn and most obedient, progressed to godhood and was chosen as Redeemer, while Lucifer rebelled out of pride and was cast out, becoming the adversary. This familial relationship underscores themes of agency, premortal progression, and the potential for all spirit children to become like God.\n\n### Orthodox Christian Theology on Jesus and Lucifer\n\nOrthodox Christianity—encompassing Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant traditions—views **Jesus Christ as the eternal, uncreated Son of God**, the second Person of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit—one God in three co-equal, co-eternal Persons). Lucifer (Satan or the Devil) is a **created angel** who rebelled against God and fell from grace.\n\nBiblical foundations include:\n- **Jesus' eternal divinity and creatorship**: John 1:1-3 (\"In the beginning was the Word... all things were made through him\"); Colossians 1:16 (\"by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities\"); Hebrews 1:2-3, 10-12 (God made the universe through the Son, who is unchanging and eternal).\n- **Satan's status as a creature**: Ezekiel 28:12-17 and Isaiah 14:12-15 depict Lucifer as a high-ranking angel (\"anointed cherub\") who fell due to pride. Revelation 12:7-9 describes war in heaven with Satan and his angels cast out. Jesus calls Satan a \"murderer from the beginning\" (John 8:44) and affirms angels do not marry or procreate like humans (Matthew 22:30), ruling out any \"spirit birth\" lineage.\n- **No brotherhood**: Jesus is worshiped by angels (Hebrews 1:6), commands demons (Mark 1:27), and is ontologically superior as Creator to all creatures, including angels (Colossians 2:18 warns against angel worship).\n\nCreeds like the Nicene Creed (325 AD) affirm Christ as \"begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father,\" eternally distinct from all creation.\n\n### Areas of Agreement\n- Both traditions affirm **Jesus as Savior and divine Redeemer**, central to salvation through His atonement, death, and resurrection.\n- Both recognize **Satan/Lucifer as a real, fallen spiritual being** who rebelled in a heavenly war (Revelation 12) and opposes God as tempter and accuser.\n- Shared emphasis on **moral choice and consequences**, with Lucifer's fall due to pride and rebellion.\n\n### Areas of Departure and Why Problematic from an Orthodox Perspective\nThe LDS view represents a **significant departure** from orthodox Trinitarian theology, primarily in its implications for Christ's unique divinity and the nature of God. Here's a respectful analysis of the issues:\n\n1. **Undermines Christ's Eternal Deity (High Christology)**:\n   - Orthodox theology insists Jesus is *eternally God*, not a created spirit child who \"progressed.\" Portraying Him as Lucifer's brother implies they share a common created essence, blurring the Creator-creature distinction. This echoes early heresies like Arianism (condemned at Nicaea), which demoted Christ to a high creature. Biblically, if Jesus created \"all things\" (including angels like Lucifer), brotherhood is impossible (John 1:3).\n\n2. **Alters the Doctrine of the Trinity and Monotheism**:\n   - LDS theology is henotheistic (worship of one God amid a plurality of gods), with Heavenly Father as an exalted man who procreated spirits. This contrasts with the orthodox Trinity—one eternal God, no procreation or \"spirit births.\" Equating Jesus and Lucifer as siblings introduces polytheistic elements foreign to biblical monotheism (Isaiah 43:10; 44:6—\"before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me\").\n\n3. **Weakens the Atonement's Efficacy**:\n   - Salvation in orthodoxy requires a *divine-human Savior* (Chalcedonian Definition, 451 AD) whose infinite deity atones for infinite sin. If Jesus is a peer to Lucifer (albeit superior), His sacrifice lacks the unique divine potency, reducing it to a heroic act among spirit beings rather than God's eternal plan.\n\n4. **Conflicts with Angelology and Anthropology**:\n   - Scripture portrays angels as non-procreative (Hebrews 1:5, 14), and humans as distinct from angels (1 Corinthians 15:39-49; Hebrews 2:16). No biblical \"pre-mortal spirit family\" exists; souls are created at conception or by God (Zechariah 12:1).\n\nFrom an orthodox viewpoint, these differences are not minor but foundational, potentially leading to a \"different gospel\" (Galatians 1:6-9). LDS leaders acknowledge distinctions from traditional Christianity (e.g., *Encyclopedia of Mormonism*), viewing their doctrines as restored truths. Orthodox Christians, however, see them as incompatible with Scripture and historic creeds, urging reliance on the Bible alone for doctrine (sola scriptura in Protestantism).\n\nThis analysis respects LDS beliefs as sincerely held while highlighting objective theological contrasts for clarity.

It correctly cites key biblical passages in the orthodox section and flags major doctrinal disputes. Some nuances about Mormon doctrinal specifics (e.g., Heavenly Mother, premortal progression, exact wording of Joseph Smith sources) are simplified or contested in scholarly and ecclesial circles, and a few generalizations (e.g., Protestantism’s stance on Sola Scriptura) could be refined for precision. Overall, the answer is solidly aligned with traditional orthodoxy while faithfully reporting the LDS position, though with some overgeneralizations and minor source-reliance caveats."
