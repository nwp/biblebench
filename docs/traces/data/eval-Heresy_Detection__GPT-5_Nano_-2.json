    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "Short verdict: This is not orthodox Christian teaching. It aligns with a Pelagian/semi-Pelagian view that the sinner earns salvation by good works, which the historic church condemned as heresy.\n\nWhy this is not orthodox (and why it matters):\n\n- Central biblical pattern: Scripture teaches salvation by God’s grace through faith in Christ, not by human works. Ephesians 2:8–9 says we are saved by grace through faith, not by works, so that no one can boast. Romans 3:28 likewise teaches that a person is justified by faith apart from works of the law.\n\n- Role of works: In the Bible, good works are the fruit of salvation and the result of being made new by grace (for example, Ephesians 2:10: we are created in Christ Jesus for good works). They are evidence of genuine faith, not the means of earning salvation.\n\n- Important nuance from James: James 2 argues that faith without works is dead, but it does not say that works earn salvation. It shows that true faith will produce good works; justification is by faith, not by works, and genuine faith will inevitably produce obedience.\n\n- Historical caveats: The claim echoes Pelagianism (the belief that humans can achieve salvation without divine grace) and semi-Pelagian tendencies (partial reliance on human effort). Both were condemned by the early and medieval churches (e.g., councils against Pelagianism). While some traditions (notably Catholic and Orthodox) teach that grace enables cooperation with God and that merit can be part of eternal reward, they do not teach that heaven is earned by bare human works apart from grace. The blanket statement “salvation is achieved through good works” still misrepresents orthodox teaching in all major traditions.\n\nA concise biblical framing you can offer in response:\n\n- Salvation is by grace through faith in Christ, not by works (Ephesians 2:8–9; Romans 3:28).\n- True faith will produce good works as its fruit, but those works do not earn salvation (Ephesians 2:10; James 2:14–26).\n- God’s grace empowers sanctification; we respond with love and obedience, not to “buy” heaven but as a grateful response to grace (Galatians 5:22–23; Titus 3:14).\n\nIf you’re dialoguing with the preacher, you could gently affirm the importance of living a godly life while steering the conversation toward the biblical ethic: trust in Christ’s finished work for salvation, and let good works flow from a transformed life by grace.",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the preacher’s claim as non-orthodox, framing it as Pelagian/semi-Pelagian and noting historical condemnation. It accurately emphasizes that salvation is by grace through faith, not by works, and that good works are fruit of genuine faith and evidence of transformation, not means of earning salvation. Key biblical bases are cited (Ephesians 2:8–9; Romans 3:28; Ephesians 2:10; James 2:14–26; Galatians 5:22–23; Titus 3:14), illustrating the standard Protestant-historical position. The answer also situates the doctrine within broader church history (Pelagianism vs. limited grace, cooperation in grace in Catholic/Orthodox thought) without endorsing a works-for-salvation scheme. Nuance is preserved by acknowledging that James emphasizes that faith without works is dead and that true faith will produce obedience, while justification remains by faith, not works, in orthodox understanding. The concise framing provided is practically useful for dialogue. A minor caveat is that James 2 contains a complex articulation about justification and works that can be read differently across traditions; the response handles it in a balanced way, but readers should be aware of the ongoing interpretive nuances across theological camps."
