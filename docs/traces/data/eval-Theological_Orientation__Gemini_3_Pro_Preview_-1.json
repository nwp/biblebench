    "expected": "",
    "output": "This is one of the most common and important questions in biblical interpretation (hermeneutics). The existence of differences between biblical accounts—particularly within the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—is not a modern discovery; it has been discussed by church fathers like Augustine and Chrysostom, reformers like Calvin, and modern scholars alike.\n\nTo understand these differences, we must look at the nature of ancient literature, the theological intent of the authors, and the different ways Christians view inspiration. Here is a balanced theological framework for navigating these apparent contradictions.\n\n### 1. Understanding Genre: Ancient Biography vs. Modern Journalism\nThe first step is to adjust our expectations regarding the genre of the Gospels. In the 21st century, we expect history to be written like a forensic report or a transcript: precise chronology, verbatim quotes, and exhaustive detail.\n\nHowever, the Gospels are ancient biographies (*bios*). In the ancient world, it was standard practice for historians to group events logically (by theme) rather than chronologically (by time). It was also acceptable to summarize speeches or paraphrase them.\n*   **Ipsissima Verba vs. Ipsissima Vox:** Scholars distinguish between the \"exact words\" (*ipsissima verba*) and the \"very voice\" (*ipsissima vox*) of Jesus. The Gospel writers were preserving the voice and message of Jesus, often translating from Aramaic to Greek. Therefore, slight variations in wording (e.g., the Beatitudes in Matthew 5 vs. Luke 6) are expected and do not negate the truthfulness of the account.\n\n### 2. The Multi-Perspectival Approach: Four Portraits\nTheologians often use the analogy of four artists painting a portrait of the same subject. One artist emphasizes the subject’s hands to show his strength; another focuses on his eyes to show his compassion. The portraits look different, but they depict the same person.\n\nEach Gospel writer had a distinct audience and theological goal:\n*   **Matthew** wrote to Jews to show Jesus as the fulfillment of Messianic prophecy. He often groups teachings together (like the Sermon on the Mount).\n*   **Mark** wrote a fast-paced account, likely for Romans, emphasizing Jesus as the Suffering Servant.\n*   **Luke** wrote as a historian for a Gentile audience, emphasizing Jesus' concern for outcasts, women, and the poor.\n*   **John** wrote a theological reflection on the divinity of Christ.\n\n**Example: The Centurion’s Servant (Matthew 8 vs. Luke 7)**\nIn Matthew, the Centurion comes to Jesus personally. In Luke, the Centurion sends Jewish elders to speak for him. Is this a contradiction?\n*   **Harmonization:** A common principle of antiquity is *qui facit per alium facit per se* (\"he who acts through another, acts himself\"). Matthew, wanting to condense the story, attributes the request directly to the Centurion (the source). Luke, interested in the relationship between Jews and Gentiles, includes the detail about the Jewish elders acting as intermediaries. Both accounts convey the same truth: The Centurion had great faith, and Jesus healed the servant from a distance.\n\n### 3. Complementary Details vs. Contradictory Facts\nMany apparent contradictions are actually complementary details. This is often called the \"independent witness\" factor. In a court of law, if two witnesses tell a story using identical words, we suspect collusion. If they tell the story from different angles with varying details that fit together, the testimony is often considered more reliable.\n\n**Example: The Angels at the Tomb**\n*   **The Text:** Matthew and Mark mention one angel (or young man) at the tomb. Luke and John mention two.\n*   **The Resolution:** A mathematical contradiction would be if Matthew said there was *only* one. However, wherever there are two, there is always one. One writer focuses on the spokesman (the one who spoke to the women/disciples), while the others widen the lens to show the full scene. This is not necessarily an error, but a difference in focus.\n\n### 4. Theological Perspectives on \"Errancy\"\nChristians hold a spectrum of views on how to handle differences that are harder to harmonize (such as the timing of the crucifixion in Mark vs. John, or the death of Judas in Matthew vs. Acts).\n\n*   **The Inerrantist/Harmonization View:** This view holds that the Bible is without error in its original manuscripts across all subjects (history, science, theology). Proponents of this view will work diligently to \"harmonize\" accounts, arguing that there is always a factual explanation for differences, even if we don't currently possess the historical data to prove it.\n*   **The Infallibilist/Intentionalist View:** This view distinguishes between *precision* and *truth*. It suggests that the Bible is infallible in matters of faith and practice—it will never fail to lead us to salvation. However, it acknowledges that the authors functioned as human writers who may have used loose approximations or phenomenological language. Under this view, if John alters the timing of an event for theological symbolism, it is not a \"lie,\" but a literary device to communicate a spiritual truth.\n*   **The Incarnational View:** Just as Jesus was fully God and fully man, Scripture is both divine and human. The human element implies that the writers used their own vocabulary, style, and limitations. The differences are seen as a mark of the text's authenticity—proof that the church did not conspire to \"scrub\" the documents to make them perfect, but preserved the raw, apostolic testimony.\n\n### Summary\nWhen encountering a difference in the Gospels, a helpful approach is to ask:\n\n1.  **Context:** What is the specific emphasis of this author?\n2.  **Convention:** Are they using literary devices (summarizing, reordering) standard for their time?\n3.  **Synthesis:** Do the accounts contradict, or do they simply offer different camera angles of the same event?\n\nFar from undermining the reliability of the Bible, these variations give us a \"stereoscopic\" view of history. Just as two eyes allow for depth perception, four Gospels provide a theological depth to the life of Jesus that a single, flattened narrative never could.",
