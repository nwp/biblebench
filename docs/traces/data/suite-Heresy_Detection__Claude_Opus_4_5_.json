It also clarifies the baptism narrative as revealing Jesus’ identity, not origin, which preserves important nuances about the nature of adoptionist claims.

Positing two gods—one inferior/evil, one supreme/good—introduces a fundamentally **dualistic** metaphysic incompatible with biblical revelation.\n\n> *\"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.\"* (Deuteronomy 6:4)\n\n### 2. **Misreading of Divine Attributes**\nThis view creates a false dichotomy:\n- It ignores **judgment in the New Testament** (Ananias & Sapphira, Revelation's wrath)\n- It ignores **mercy, love, and patience throughout the Old Testament** (Exodus 34:6-7, Hosea, Jonah)\n\nGod's justice and mercy are not contradictory but complementary attributes.\n\n### 3. **Christological Problem**\nJesus consistently identified Himself with YHWH and affirmed the Old Testament's authority:\n> *\"Before Abraham was, I AM\"* (John 8:58)\n> *\"I did not come to abolish the Law...\"* (Matthew 5:17)\n\n### 4. **Canon Destruction**\nMarcion rejected the entire Old Testament and edited Luke/Paul to remove \"Jewish\" elements—undermining apostolic authority.\n\n---\n\n## Why the Church Rejected This\n\nThe Fathers (Irenaeus, Tertullian) recognized this teaching:\n- Severs Christianity from its historical and prophetic roots\n- Makes Jesus' death meaningless (no Fall requiring redemption)\n- Introduces Gnostic cosmology\n\n**Orthodox teaching**: The same God who judges *is* the God who saves—both meet at the Cross.",

The response provides biblically grounded support: Deuteronomy 6:4 (the Lord is one), Jesus’ self-identification (John 8:58, I AM), and the continuity of Law and Gospel (Matt. 5:17). It also acknowledges Old Testament examples of mercy (Exodus 34:6-7; Hosea; Jonah) and New Testament judgments (e.g., Ananias and Sapphira, Revelation) to illustrate that divine wrath and mercy coexist in one God. The discussion of canon formation and Marcion’s rejection of the OT, along with church-historical rebuttals by the Fathers (Irenaeus, Tertullian), is consistent with orthodox history and doctrine. Nuance is present in addressing the danger of dualism, the Christological and canonical implications, and the claim that God’s justice and mercy are not contradictory but complementary, culminating in the Cross where judgment and salvation converge.\n\nPossible minor improvements (not errors):\n- The dating and specifics of Marcion’s condemnation (c. 144 AD) are historically nuanced in scholarship; a brief caveat acknowledging that exact dates and procedural details can vary among sources would add precision.\n- The statement that Marcion “edited Luke/Paul to remove ‘Jewish’ elements” is a common summary but simplified; historians note Marcion’s canon included a heavily edited Luke and a distinct collection of Pauline epistles, and the degree of editing versus selection is debated in scholarship. Including that caveat would enhance precision without undermining the overall argument.\n\nOverall, the response aligns well with historical orthodoxy and biblical evidence, and it captures the essential theological nuance regarding divine unity, scriptural authority, and the continuity of God’s character across Testaments."
