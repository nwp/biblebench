It accurately notes the purpose as presenting the gospel and preparing for Paul’s visit; it also accurately reflects Romans 15:24 and 28–29, where Paul expresses a plan to visit Rome and eventually pursue a mission to Spain. The mention of addressing tensions regarding the Law aligns with Romans’ exploration of Law, faith, and righteousness and is a meaningful nuance of the letter’s purpose. Overall, the answer is aligned with biblical teaching and historic Christian understanding, with appropriate nuance about audience, purpose, and Paul’s broader missionary aim."
