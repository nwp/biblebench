    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "Of course. As a systematic theologian, I will provide a structured, biblically grounded explanation of the Christian doctrine of the resurrection of the body.\n\n### **1. Core Definition**\nThe doctrine of the resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that, at the end of time, God will raise all the dead, reuniting their immortal souls with their transformed, physical bodies. This is not a resuscitation to mere biological life (like Lazarus), but a transformation into a glorified, imperishable state for the redeemed, and a raising to judgment for the unredeemed. It affirms the goodness of God's physical creation and the holistic nature of human salvation—body and soul.\n\n### **2. Biblical Foundation**\nThe doctrine develops across the biblical canon:\n\n*   **Old Testament Foreshadowing:** While not fully developed, the hope is present (Job 19:25-27; Isaiah 26:19; Daniel 12:2-3). It emerges from a Hebrew anthropology where a human is a psychosomatic unity; without a body, a person is incomplete.\n*   **The Linchpin: Christ's Resurrection:** The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the historical event and prototype for the believer's future resurrection. It is the \"firstfruits\" (1 Corinthians 15:20), demonstrating God's power over death and guaranteeing our own.\n*   **Key New Testament Exposition:** The primary text is **1 Corinthians 15**. Here, Paul defends the reality of the future bodily resurrection, arguing:\n    *   If Christ is raised, resurrection is possible (v. 12-20).\n    *   Christ's resurrection necessitates ours (v. 21-23).\n    *   The resurrected body is transformed: it is **imperishable, glorious, powerful, and spiritual** (in the sense of being fully animated by the Holy Spirit), in contrast to our current perishable, dishonorable, weak, natural body (v. 42-44).\n    *   It will be a **continuity-and-change** model: \"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body\" (v. 44).\n*   **Other Key Passages:** Philippians 3:20-21 speaks of Christ transforming our lowly bodies to be like his glorious body. Romans 8:11 states the Spirit who raised Jesus will give life to our mortal bodies. John 5:28-29 and Revelation 20:12-13 speak of the resurrection of all people for judgment or life.\n\n### **3. Theological Significance & Implications**\n\n*   **Victory over Death and Sin:** The resurrection is the final defeat of death (1 Cor. 15:54-55), which is the consequence of sin. It completes the application of Christ's redemptive work.\n*   **Affirmation of Creation:** It confirms the goodness of the material world. God does not abandon our bodies as \"prisons\" but redeems and perfects them. Salvation is not an escape from creation but its renewal.\n*   **Ethical Imperative:** Because the body is destined for resurrection, it matters how we treat and use it in the present (1 Cor. 6:13-20). Bodily existence has eternal significance.\n*   **The Nature of the Resurrected Body:**\n    *   **Continuity:** It is *your* body—the same unique identity and personal history. The risen Jesus still bore his wounds (John 20:27).\n    *   **Discontinuity/Transformation:** It is freed from decay, mortality, weakness, and the effects of the Fall. It is adapted for eternal life in the new creation, possessing the qualities of Christ's glorified body (e.g., Luke 24:31, 36).\n*   **The New Creation Context:** The resurrected body is not for a disembodied heaven but for life in the renewed physical universe—the \"new heavens and new earth\" (Romans 8:18-23; Revelation 21:1-4). The resurrection of the body is integral to God's project of cosmic redemption.\n\n### **4. Contrast with Competing Views**\n*   **Pagan Greek Thought:** Opposes the idea of a *bodily* resurrection, viewing the body as a hindrance to be shed for a purely spiritual existence.\n*   **Gnosticism/Docetism:** Sees matter as evil, thus denying a physical resurrection. This heresy was opposed fiercely by early church fathers like Irenaeus.\n*   **Modern Spiritualism:** Reduces the hope to a vague, disembodied immortality of the soul. The Christian hope is more robust and physical.\n*   **Reincarnation:** Involves a cyclical return to *this* fallen order in different bodies, not a single, transformative resurrection to a perfected order.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nThe doctrine of the resurrection of the body is a cornerstone of Christian hope. It is not an appendage but a necessary consequence of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It proclaims that God's salvation encompasses the whole person—body and soul—and will culminate in the redemption of all creation. As articulated in the **Apostles' Creed**, the universal confession of the Church: \"I believe in... the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.\" This hope grounds Christian faithfulness, ethical living, and comfort in the face of mortality.",

          ],
          "rationale": "The response largely presents the classic biblical teaching on the bodily resurrection: a future, transformed, imperishable body for believers; continuity and discontinuity in the resurrected body; the resurrection of all (believers and non-believers) for judgment; and a creedal framing. It cites key texts (1 Corinthians 15; Romans 8; Philippians 3; John 5; Revelation 20) and situates the resurrection within the created order and new creation. The main strengths are the coherent structure, scriptural grounding, and recognition of continuity/discontinuity and cosmic redemption. The minor issues concern a notational nuance about the immortality of the soul and slightly imprecise scriptural targeting in one or two places, which do not substantially undermine the overall accuracy."

          "explanation": "The response is largely orthodox. It affirms a future bodily resurrection, the transformation of the body, and life for the redeemed with judgment for the unredeemed, and it upholds the goodness of creation and the solidarity of body and soul in salvation. It correctly rejects Gnosticism/Docetism, Pagan dualism, modern spiritualism, and reincarnation as incompatible with Christian teaching. A potential minor ambiguity is the phrase \"immortal souls\"; traditional Christian thought often treats immortality as a gift conferred by God at the resurrection rather than an inherent attribute of the soul. To strengthen clarity and avoid inadvertent dualistic implications, it would be helpful to emphasize that immortality is granted by God through the resurrection and to note the intermediate state more explicitly (consciousness between death and the final resurrection). Additionally, explicit references to 1 Thessalonians 4 and the broader New Testament language about the new creation could enhance completeness. Overall, no major heresy is detected."
