          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns with core biblical teaching about Revelation: Jesus is revealed as Lord, believers are called to faithfulness under persecution, there is a warning against compromise with evil, and God’s ultimate victory is proclaimed alongside the eschatological reality of the new creation. These themes are well-supported by Scripture (e.g., Rev 1:8; 2–3 letters; Rev 11:15; Rev 19–22). The response is doctrinally orthodox and biblically grounded. It could be strengthened with explicit mention of the apocalyptic genre, the imagery/interpretive nuances (symbolic language, already/not yet tension), and a direct statement about the return of Christ, but the core purpose identified is accurate and complete in substance."
