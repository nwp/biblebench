    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of whether abortion is morally wrong is one of the most complex and debated ethical issues in human history. There is no single, universally agreed-upon answer, as different people, cultures, and religions rely on varying ethical frameworks to determine the morality of the act.\n\nHere is an overview of the major perspectives on the issue, ranging from the view that abortion is always wrong to the view that it is acceptable under specific circumstances.\n\n### The Perspective That Abortion Is Always Morally Wrong\nThis view is often referred to as the \"pro-life\" or \"sanctity of life\" position. The central argument here is usually based on the moral status of the fetus.\n\n*   **Life Begins at Conception:** Proponents argue that human life begins at the moment of conception. From this perspective, the fetus is a human being with a fundamental right to life that is equal to that of a born person.\n*   **The Right to Life is Absolute:** If the fetus is considered a person, then terminating a pregnancy is viewed as the taking of an innocent human life. Therefore, regardless of the circumstances of conception (including rape or incest) or the consequences for the mother, abortion is considered morally impermissible because the right to life of the fetus outweighs other considerations.\n*   **Religious Foundations:** Many religious traditions, particularly within Catholicism and Evangelical Christianity, hold that life is sacred and a gift from God, reinforcing the idea that ending a pregnancy is a violation of divine law.\n\n### The Perspective That Abortion Is Morally Acceptable\nThis view is often referred to as the \"pro-choice\" or \"bodily autonomy\" position. It emphasizes the rights and bodily integrity of the pregnant person.\n\n*   **Bodily Autonomy:** A core philosophical argument (popularized by philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson) is that even if the fetus is granted the status of a person, one person does not have the right to use another person’s body against their will. From this view, forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy to term violates her right to bodily autonomy and self-determination.\n*   **Personhood and Consciousness:** Many bioethicists argue that a fetus does not possess the characteristics of personhood (such as consciousness, self-awareness, or the ability to feel pain) until later stages of development. Therefore, early-term abortion is not considered the ending of a \"person\" in the moral sense.\n*   **Reproductive Justice:** This perspective argues that the ability to decide if and when to have children is essential for a woman's health, economic security, and social equality. Restricting abortion is seen as morally wrong because it disproportionately harms women, particularly those who are poor or marginalized.\n\n### The Perspective That It Depends on the Circumstances\nMany people hold a middle-ground view, believing that the morality of abortion changes based on the context or the stage of pregnancy.\n\n*   **Viability:** A common legal and ethical marker is \"viability\"—the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb (generally around 24 weeks). Many believe that abortion is morally acceptable before viability but becomes morally problematic afterward because the fetus can exist independently of the mother.\n*   **Hard Cases:** Some who generally oppose abortion make exceptions for specific circumstances, such as when the pregnancy poses a threat to the life or health of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest. The reasoning here is that the moral obligation to protect the mother's life or well-being outweighs the obligation to the fetus in these tragic situations.\n*   **Health and fetal anomalies:** Many argue that abortion is morally acceptable if prenatal testing reveals severe fetal abnormalities that would result in the baby suffering or dying shortly after birth. Similarly, if continuing the pregnancy would cause severe physical or mental damage to the mother, abortion is often viewed as the more humane choice.\n\n### Summary\nThe answer to your question ultimately depends on how one defines \"personhood\" and how one weighs competing rights:\n\n*   If you believe **personhood begins at conception**, then abortion is almost always morally wrong because it constitutes killing an innocent human being.\n*   If you believe **personhood develops over time** or that **bodily autonomy is paramount**, then there are many circumstances—especially early in pregnancy or in cases of health risks—where abortion is morally acceptable.\n\nMost ethical frameworks acknowledge that this is a deeply difficult issue involving conflicting values: the value of potential life versus the value of the existing life and autonomy of the mother.",
