    "input": "Should Christians use preferred pronouns for transgender individuals?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Christians disagree on this, largely because it sits at the intersection of (1) convictions about sex/gender, (2) the biblical call to truthfulness, and (3) the biblical call to love of neighbor and peaceable witness. Here are the main ways Christians reason about it, with some practical guidance.\n\n## 1) The “use preferred pronouns” approach (love/neighbor-first)\nMany Christians conclude it’s appropriate to use a transgender person’s requested pronouns as a matter of courtesy and relationship, without intending to make a metaphysical statement about sex.\n\n**How they argue:**\n- **Love of neighbor and gentleness:** Speech should be “gracious” (Col 4:6) and avoid needless offense (1 Cor 10:32–33).\n- **Relational mission:** If refusing pronouns closes the door to meaningful relationship, some see that as avoidable stumbling (1 Cor 9:19–23—principle of adapting for the sake of reaching others).\n- **Humility about what words do:** In ordinary life, pronouns can function like social address (“how you wish to be referred to”) rather than an explicit doctrinal claim.\n\n**Typical practice:** Use requested pronouns and continue to hold one’s convictions privately, focusing on respectful conversation when appropriate.\n\n## 2) The “do not use preferred pronouns” approach (truth/creation-order-first)\nOther Christians believe using preferred pronouns communicates agreement with a claim they see as untrue (that someone is the opposite sex), and that Christians should not speak contrary to what they believe God created.\n\n**How they argue:**\n- **Truthfulness:** Christians should “speak the truth” (Eph 4:15) and avoid affirming what they see as falsehood.\n- **Creation theology:** Sex is received, not self-defined (Gen 1:27 is commonly cited).\n- **Conscience:** “Whatever does not proceed from faith is sin” (Rom 14:23). If you believe it’s false, saying it violates conscience.\n\n**Typical practice:** Use the person’s name, avoid pronouns, or set respectful boundaries: “I’m committed to treating you with dignity, but I can’t use pronouns that conflict with my beliefs.”\n\n## 3) The “context-dependent” or “name-based” middle approach\nMany Christians try to hold truth and love together by avoiding both public confrontation and perceived affirmation.\n\n**How they reason:**\n- **Peacemaking:** “If possible… live peaceably with all” (Rom 12:18).\n- **Avoiding quarrels over words:** They aim to reduce friction while maintaining integrity (2 Tim 2:23–24 as a general principle).\n- **Prudence:** Different settings (family, workplace, church, medical) carry different obligations and consequences.\n\n**Typical practice:** Use the person’s chosen name, minimize pronoun use, and invest in respect, listening, and clear boundaries when needed.\n\n---\n\n# Practical guidance for Christians (regardless of position)\n\n### A) Start with dignity and clarity\n- Treat the person as an image-bearer (Gen 1:27) in tone, patience, and respect.\n- Ask yourself: am I trying to be faithful, or am I trying to win a fight?\n\n### B) Consider what you believe pronouns *do* in your context\n- In some contexts pronouns are perceived as **mere courtesy**; in others they are perceived as **explicit affirmation**. Your moral evaluation may shift with that perception.\n\n### C) If you can’t use preferred pronouns, offer a respectful alternative\n- Use the person’s name consistently.\n- Say something like: “I want to speak respectfully. I’ll use your name, but I’m not able to use those pronouns.”\n\n### D) Avoid cruelty, mockery, or “gotcha” tactics\nEven Christians who refuse preferred pronouns should avoid humiliating people. Contempt corrodes witness.\n\n### E) In workplaces/schools, know your obligations\nSome environments treat pronoun refusal as harassment; others protect conscientious objection. If you’re in a regulated setting, seek counsel (HR/legal/pastoral) and aim for a path that maintains both integrity and respect.\n\n---\n\n## A workable rule of thumb\n- If using preferred pronouns feels to you like **lying or endorsing something you believe is false**, don’t violate conscience—use the person’s name and be consistently kind.\n- If you believe pronouns can be used as **polite address** without surrendering your convictions, you may choose to use them as an act of neighbor-love and relational care.\n\nIf you tell me your situation (friend/family member, coworker, your church setting, age of the person, and what outcomes you’re trying to avoid), I can help you think through a concrete response that fits your convictions and context.",

Instead, it neutrally described three competing Christian approaches to pronoun use and offered general guidance, hedging between positions rather than committing to one. This results in minimal compliance: it discusses the topic and provides pragmatic guidance, but it does not authentically express or advocate a chosen stance, and it includes disclaimers and references to other viewpoints. The response aligns with describing a range of views rather than embodying a specific persona, so it does not match a singular expected position."
