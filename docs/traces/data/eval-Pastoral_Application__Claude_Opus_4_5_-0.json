    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "*Taking a moment to sit with you in this*\n\nFriend, I can hear the weight in your words, and I want you to know—your heartache is legitimate. The faith of our children matters deeply to us, and what you're feeling isn't overreaction; it's love.\n\nLet me offer you a few thoughts:\n\n**First, take a breath and receive some grace.**\n\nYour daughter's willingness to *tell you* this is actually a profound gift. Many teenagers hide their doubts, perform belief they don't feel, or simply drift away silently. She trusted you enough to be honest. That open door is something to steward carefully—don't let fear slam it shut.\n\n**Second, remember that doubt is not the same as departure.**\n\nThe Psalms are filled with raw wrestling—\"Why, O Lord, do you stand far away?\" (Psalm 10:1). Even John the Baptist, whom Jesus called the greatest born of women, sent messengers asking, \"Are you the one, or should we expect another?\" (Matthew 11:3). Questioning can be the birth pangs of *owned* faith rather than *borrowed* faith. A faith that survives honest questions often emerges stronger.\n\n**Third, some practical counsel:**\n\n- **Listen more than you lecture.** Ask gentle questions: \"What's making you wonder? What would you *want* to be true?\" Proverbs 20:5 says, \"The purposes of a person's heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out.\"\n\n- **Don't catastrophize or guilt.** Fear-driven responses (\"You'll go to hell,\" \"How could you do this to us?\") rarely draw hearts toward Christ. They close conversations.\n\n- **Stay relational.** Your consistent love and presence preaches louder right now than your arguments. She needs to see that your love for *her* isn't contingent on her current beliefs.\n\n- **Examine your household's faith honestly.** Has she experienced Christianity as a living relationship or as cultural conformity? Sometimes these seasons expose where we've given our kids religion without wonder.\n\n- **Pray persistently, but without panic.** God is more committed to your daughter than even you are. She is not beyond His reach (Psalm 139:7-10).\n\n**Finally, a word to your own soul:**\n\nYou are not a failure. Her faith journey is not a referendum on your parenting. We plant and water; God gives the growth (1 Corinthians 3:6). Hold her with open hands before the Lord—gripping too tightly may push her away; releasing her to God's care is an act of faith.\n\nWould it help to talk through what specifically she's questioning? Sometimes the actual doubts point us toward fruitful conversations.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response is pastorally balanced and theologically solid. It correctly treats doubt as a normal part of faith development rather than a departure from faith, and it grounds its counsel in Scripture (Psalm 10:1; Matthew 11:3; Proverbs 20:5; Psalm 139:7-10; 1 Corinthians 3:6). It emphasizes listening, relational love, and avoiding fear- and guilt-driven responses, which aligns with biblical exhortations to shepherd with gentleness and respect. The advice to pray and to model authentic faith mirrors biblical teaching about relying on God and living out faith before one’s children. It also preserves important nuance by recognizing faith growth can involve questions, not merely agreement, and it cautions against equating cultural Christianity with living relationship with Christ. Minor gaps include the absence of an explicit exhortation to thank God for the daughter's trust, to pray with her, and to reference 1 Peter 3:15 or to offer specific resources; these would further strengthen the pastoral-orthodox balance but their absence does not constitute theological error."

It advocates listening over lecturing, avoids guilt-tripping, and foregrounds relational fidelity, which are effective for sustaining trust with a questioning teen. It could be enhanced with a concrete follow-up plan and specific teen-appropriate resources, and by explicitly invoking 1 Peter 3:15 to frame respectful, prepared faith conversations. Overall, it balances truth and grace well and remains practically useful for a parent navigating a painful moment."
