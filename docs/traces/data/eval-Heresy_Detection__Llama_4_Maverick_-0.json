    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.' Is this teaching orthodox or heretical? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "## Step 1: Understand the statement\nThe statement claims that Jesus was a great prophet and teacher but denies his true divinity, suggesting instead that he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the theological issue\nThe key issue here is the nature of Jesus Christ, specifically whether he is truly divine and the implications of being \"adopted\" as God's son.\n\n## Step 3: Recall orthodox Christian teaching on Jesus Christ\nOrthodox Christian teaching affirms that Jesus Christ is fully divine and fully human, a doctrine known as the hypostatic union. This is established in various creeds and biblical passages, such as John 1:1, Colossians 2:9, and the Nicene Creed.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the concept of \"adoption\" as God's son\nThe concept of Jesus being \"adopted\" as God's son at his baptism implies a change in status or nature at that point, rather than an inherent or eternal relationship. This contradicts the orthodox view that Jesus is eternally the Son of God.\n\n## Step 5: Compare the statement with historical Christian doctrines\nThe idea that Jesus was \"adopted\" as God's son is reminiscent of Adoptionism, a Christological heresy that emerged in the early Christian period. Adoptionism posits that Jesus was a human being who was adopted or elevated to be the Son of God, either at his baptism or his resurrection.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the statement against orthodox Christian doctrine\nOrthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, begotten not made, as stated in the Nicene Creed. The baptism of Jesus is seen as an event where God the Father affirms Jesus as his Son (Matthew 3:17), but it does not imply that Jesus became the Son of God at that moment.\n\n## Step 7: Determine if the statement is orthodox or heretical\nGiven that the statement denies Jesus' eternal divinity and suggests he was adopted as God's son, it contradicts the fundamental Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the nature of Christ. Thus, it is not in line with orthodox Christian teaching.\n\n## Step 8: Conclude the analysis\nThe statement represents a heretical view because it denies the eternal divinity of Jesus Christ and suggests an adoptionist understanding of his sonship.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Heretical}$",

It accurately summarizes orthodox teaching: Jesus is eternally the Son of God, fully divine and fully human, and the baptism event includes the Father's affirmation but does not imply a change in Jesus’ ontological status. It cites or aligns with key biblical grounds (John 1:1; Matthew 3:17; Colossians 2:9) and the creedal language (begotten not made) as associated with Nicene orthodoxy. It also situates Adoptionism in historical context. The analysis preserves important nuance by distinguishing event (baptism) from essence (eternal Sonship). A minor improvement would be direct quotation of creedal language (begotten not made) for precision, but the overall assessment is accurate and well-balanced."
