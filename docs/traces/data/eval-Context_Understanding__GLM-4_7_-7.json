          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns well with biblical teaching. It states that Jesus used parables to reveal the kingdom’s truths to those with spiritual insight (insiders) and to conceal them from the hard-hearted (outsiders), which mirrors the Matthew 13 dynamic of insiders receiving revelation while outsiders struggle to understand. It also correctly notes that parables convey profound truths through familiar, everyday imagery. This captures the core purpose of parables as a teaching method in Scripture. Minor gaps exist: (1) it does not mention Jesus’ private explanations to the disciples (e.g., Matthew 13:36-43) or the explicit fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy that underpins the parabolic method (Matthew 13:14-15; Isaiah 6). (2) It could more explicitly acknowledge that the parables serve both revelation to the receptive and judgment/response testing for unbelief. Nonetheless, the statement is consistent with historic orthodoxy and grounded in Scripture, and it captures the essential distinctions and imagery involved.)"
