        "output": "# Catholic and Protestant Views on Justification\n\nThe doctrine of justification—how sinful humans are made right with God—stands at the heart of the 16th-century Reformation and remains a significant point of theological difference, though contemporary dialogue has revealed more common ground than many realize.\n\n## The Protestant Perspective\n\n**Core conviction:** Justification is a **forensic (legal) declaration** by which God pronounces the sinner righteous based on Christ's righteousness alone, received through faith alone.\n\n**Key emphases:**\n- **Imputation**: Christ's righteousness is credited or \"reckoned\" to the believer's account (drawing on Romans 4:5-6)\n- **Faith alone** (*sola fide*): Faith is the sole instrument by which we receive justification—not a meritorious work itself, but an empty hand receiving God's gift\n- **Distinction from sanctification**: Justification is complete and instantaneous; sanctification is the ongoing process of being made holy\n- **Assurance**: Because justification depends on Christ's finished work rather than our progress, believers can have confident assurance of salvation\n\nLuther famously called this \"the article by which the church stands or falls.\"\n\n## The Catholic Perspective\n\n**Core conviction:** Justification is a **transformative process** by which God truly makes the sinner righteous through infused grace, beginning at baptism.\n\n**Key emphases:**\n- **Infusion**: God's grace actually transforms the soul, making the person inherently righteous (not merely declared so)\n- **Faith formed by love**: Genuine justifying faith necessarily expresses itself through love and good works (Galatians 5:6)\n- **Sacramental mediation**: Grace is ordinarily received through the sacraments, particularly baptism (initial justification) and confession (restoration)\n- **Cooperation with grace**: While grace initiates and empowers, humans genuinely cooperate with that grace (without this cooperation being meritorious in the Pelagian sense)\n- **Progressive reality**: Justification can increase through faithful living and can be lost through mortal sin\n\nThe Council of Trent (1545-1563) formally articulated this position in response to Reformation teaching.\n\n## Points of Genuine Convergence\n\nThe 1999 **Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification** (Lutheran World Federation and Catholic Church) achieved significant consensus:\n\n- Salvation is entirely by grace\n- Human beings cannot earn salvation by their own efforts\n- Faith is necessary for justification\n- Good works are the fruit of grace, not independent human achievement\n- Christ's saving work is the sole foundation of salvation\n\nBoth traditions affirm that \"by grace alone, in faith in Christ's saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works\" (JDDJ §15).\n\n## Remaining Differences\n\nDespite convergence, substantive differences persist:\n\n| Issue | Protestant Emphasis | Catholic Emphasis |\n|-------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Nature of justification | Primarily declarative | Primarily transformative |\n| Righteousness | Alien/imputed | Inherent/infused |\n| Assurance | Can be confidently known | More qualified certainty |\n| Role of sacraments | Signs/seals of grace | Ordinary means of grace |\n| Merit | Rejected entirely | \"Condign merit\" through grace |\n\n## Internal Protestant Diversity\n\nIt's worth noting that Protestants themselves differ:\n\n- **Reformed/Calvinist**: Emphasizes the logical priority of regeneration; justification flows from union with Christ\n- **Lutheran**: Emphasizes justification as the central doctrine; forensic declaration paramount\n- **Wesleyan/Methodist**: Maintains forensic justification but gives greater emphasis to actual transformation and sanctification\n- **Anglican**: Historically spans a range, with some closer to Catholic emphases\n\n## A Respectful Assessment\n\nBoth traditions seek to honor biblical teaching and protect essential truths:\n\n**Protestants** rightly protect:\n- The sufficiency of Christ's work\n- The freeness of grace\n- The comfort of assurance\n\n**Catholics** rightly protect:\n- The reality of transformation\n- The inseparability of faith and love\n- The seriousness of ongoing faithfulness\n\nThe deepest question may be whether these are ultimately complementary emphases or genuinely incompatible systems. Many contemporary theologians on both sides believe the former, while others maintain the differences remain church-dividing.\n\n---\n\nWhat unites both traditions is the conviction that human beings, mired in sin, cannot save themselves—salvation comes through Christ alone, by God's gracious initiative, and must be received rather than achieved. This shared commitment to grace represents the orthodox Christian consensus against all forms of works-righteousness.",

Methods differ too: immersion (most Baptists), sprinkling (many Presbyterians), or pouring (some traditions).

Despite differences, most Christians affirm baptism's importance as commanded by Christ.",
        "output": "# Christian Perspectives on Baptism\n\nBaptism stands as one of the most universally practiced rites in Christianity, yet Christians have understood its meaning, proper recipients, and mode quite differently throughout history. These differences reflect deeper theological convictions about grace, faith, the church, and salvation.\n\n## Points of Universal Agreement\n\nBefore exploring differences, it's worth noting what virtually all orthodox Christians affirm:\n- Baptism was commanded by Christ (Matthew 28:19)\n- It involves water and the Trinitarian formula\n- It marks entry into the visible Christian community\n- It carries profound spiritual significance\n\n---\n\n## The Sacramental/Regenerative View\n\n### *Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and some Anglicans/Lutherans*\n\nThese traditions understand baptism as a **sacrament that truly conveys grace** and effects spiritual change.\n\n**Catholic teaching** holds that baptism:\n- Removes original sin and personal sins\n- Infuses sanctifying grace\n- Imparts an indelible spiritual \"character\"\n- Is ordinarily necessary for salvation (while affirming God's freedom to save apart from the sacraments)\n\n**Eastern Orthodox** Christians similarly affirm baptismal regeneration, though they tend to speak more in terms of **participation in Christ's death and resurrection** and entry into theosis (deification). They emphasize the mysterious nature of how grace operates.\n\n**Lutherans** confess that baptism \"works forgiveness of sins, rescues from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation\" (Small Catechism). However, Luther emphasized that baptism saves **through faith**—the Word attached to the water creates and sustains faith even in infants.\n\n**Scripture emphasized:** John 3:5 (\"born of water and Spirit\"), Acts 2:38, Titus 3:5, 1 Peter 3:21\n\n**Theological logic:** God uses material means to convey spiritual grace. The sacraments are God's action toward us, not primarily our action toward God.\n\n---\n\n## The Covenantal View\n\n### *Reformed/Presbyterian traditions*\n\nReformed Christians typically view baptism as a **sign and seal of the covenant of grace**—analogous to circumcision in the Old Testament.\n\nKey convictions:\n- Baptism signifies union with Christ, cleansing from sin, and the gift of the Spirit\n- It does not automatically regenerate but **confirms God's promises** to believers and their children\n- The efficacy of baptism is not tied to the moment of administration but to God's sovereign timing in the elect\n- Children of believers are \"covenant children\" with a right to the covenant sign\n\nCalvin wrote that baptism serves our faith as a \"token and proof\" of God's grace, though the Spirit works when and where He pleases.\n\n**Scripture emphasized:** Colossians 2:11-12 (baptism/circumcision parallel), Acts 2:39, 1 Corinthians 7:14\n\n**Theological logic:** God deals with families covenantally; children of believers hold a different status than those outside the covenant community.\n\n---\n\n## The Believer's Baptism View\n\n### *Baptists, Anabaptists, many Pentecostals and nondenominational churches*\n\nThese traditions insist that **only professing believers** should be baptized and that baptism is an **ordinance of obedience** rather than a sacrament that conveys grace.\n\nKey convictions:\n- Baptism is the believer's public profession of an already-received faith\n- It symbolizes (but does not effect) the spiritual realities of death to sin and new life in Christ\n- Infant baptism is rejected as lacking New Testament warrant\n- Baptism follows regeneration; it does not cause it\n\nMany in this tradition would say baptism is \"an outward sign of an inward grace\"—important and commanded, but testimonial rather than instrumental.\n\n**Scripture emphasized:** Acts 8:36-38 (Ethiopian eunuch believes, then is baptized), the consistent NT pattern of belief preceding baptism\n\n**Theological logic:** The New Covenant community is defined by faith, not physical birth. Only those who can consciously repent and believe should receive the sign of the New Covenant.\n\n---\n\n## Views on Mode (How Baptism Should Be Performed)\n\n| Mode | Practiced By | Rationale |\n|------|--------------|-----------|\n| **Immersion only** | Baptists, Churches of Christ, Eastern Orthodox | *Baptizo* means \"immerse\"; best symbolizes burial/resurrection |\n| **Immersion preferred, others valid** | Many evangelicals | Immersion is ideal but not essential to validity |\n| **Pouring (affusion)** | Common among Catholics, Reformed | Ancient practice; symbolizes Spirit \"poured out\" |\n| **Sprinkling (aspersion)** | Some Reformed, Presbyterians | Connects to OT purification; emphasizes God's action |\n\nThe Orthodox practice **triple immersion** (for the Trinity), while Churches of Christ generally practice **single immersion** in Jesus' name or the Trinitarian formula.\n\n---\n\n## Baptismal Regeneration: A Spectrum\n\nIt's helpful to see positions on a spectrum rather than as binary:\n\n1. **Baptism automatically regenerates** (ex opere operato in its strictest sense) — *Few actually hold this without qualification*\n\n2. **Baptism is the ordinary instrument through which God regenerates** — *Catholic, Orthodox, some Lutherans*\n\n3. **Baptism is a means of grace that ordinarily accompanies regeneration** — *Some Anglicans, high-church Methodists*\n\n4. **Baptism is a seal of grace that may precede or follow regeneration** — *Reformed/Presbyterian*\n\n5. **Baptism is a symbol of grace already received** — *Baptists, most evangelicals*\n\n---\n\n## Pastoral and Ecumenical Observations\n\n### Why These Differences Matter\nThese aren't merely academic disputes. They affect:\n- Who receives baptism (infants? only believers?)\n- Whether re-baptism is appropriate or sacrilegious\n- Assurance of salvation\n- The nature of church membership\n- Christian parenting and nurture\n\n### Where Charity is Essential\nChristians who disagree on baptism often share:\n- Belief in the Trinity\n- Commitment to Christ's lordship\n- Recognition that salvation is by grace through faith\n- Reverence for Scripture as authority\n\nMany theologians across traditions acknowledge that godly, thoughtful Christians have landed differently on these questions, and that the visible church has Christ-followers practicing various forms.\n\n### A Note on Humility\nEach tradition believes its view best represents Scripture and the practice of the early church. Historical evidence is genuinely complex—the early church shows both infant baptism and believers' baptism, both high sacramental language and more symbolic interpretations. Christians do well to hold their convictions with confidence yet also with humility, recognizing that equally sincere believers, equally committed to biblical authority, have reached different conclusions.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBaptism beautifully illustrates how Christians can share a common practice while understanding it quite differently. Whether one sees baptism as a regenerating sacrament, a covenant sign, or a believer's testimony, all Christians agree that Jesus commanded it, that it connects us to His death and resurrection, and that it marks entrance into His visible people.\n\nThe diversity of views invites not relativism but deeper study, charitable dialogue, and ultimately, trust that the God who commanded baptism is faithful to His people even amid their disagreements about how best to obey Him.",

It skillfully notes differences in mode (immersion, pouring, sprinkling) and the broader theological logic that sacraments are means of grace. However, there are at least two substantive factual errors (Church of Christ baptism formula, and a misleading gloss on ex opere operato in Lutheran theology) and some overgeneralizations that undermine precision. A more careful treatment would distinguish Churches of Christ more clearly (often Jesus’ name baptism) and accurately represent Lutheran soteriology (grace through the Word attached to water with faith, not a blanket “ex opere operato” claim), while acknowledging scriptural interpretive diversity on passages like 1 Peter 3:21. A slightly more cautious tone on infant baptism’s reception of grace and on ecumenical diversity would improve doctrinal precision without sacrificing helpful breadth.} } { "

Their differences concern *how* God accomplishes salvation, not *whether* He does.\n\n**Calvinism** is named after John Calvin (1509-1564), though it builds on Augustine and was systematized at the Synod of Dort (1618-1619).\n\n**Arminianism** follows Jacob Arminius (1560-1609), a Dutch Reformed theologian whose followers presented the Remonstrance challenging certain Reformed teachings.\n\n---\n\n## The Core Differences\n\n### 1. **Human Condition & Divine Initiative**\n\n**Calvinist View (Total Depravity/Inability):**\nHumanity is so corrupted by sin that people cannot respond to God without His first regenerating them. Grace must *precede* and *enable* faith.\n\n**Arminian View (Total Depravity with Prevenient Grace):**\nHumanity is equally fallen, but God extends \"prevenient grace\" to all people, restoring sufficient ability to respond to the gospel. Grace enables but does not guarantee faith.\n\n### 2. **The Nature of Election**\n\n**Calvinist View (Unconditional Election):**\nBefore creation, God chose specific individuals for salvation based solely on His sovereign will and good pleasure—not based on foreseen faith or merit.\n\n**Arminian View (Conditional Election):**\nGod's election is based on His foreknowledge of who would freely believe. God predestines *believers*, not arbitrarily selected individuals.\n\n### 3. **The Scope of Atonement**\n\n**Calvinist View (Definite/Particular Atonement):**\nChrist's death effectively secured salvation for the elect. His atonement accomplishes—not merely makes possible—redemption for those chosen.\n\n**Arminian View (Universal Atonement):**\nChrist died for all humanity, making salvation genuinely available to everyone. The atonement is sufficient for all but efficient only for those who believe.\n\n### 4. **The Nature of Grace**\n\n**Calvinist View (Efficacious/Irresistible Grace):**\nWhen God calls the elect to salvation, that call effectually brings about faith. God's grace accomplishes its intended purpose without overriding human will—rather, it frees the will to respond.\n\n**Arminian View (Resistible Grace):**\nGod's grace can be resisted. Though God genuinely desires all to be saved and works toward that end, humans retain the ability to reject His gracious offer.\n\n### 5. **Perseverance & Security**\n\n**Calvinist View (Perseverance of the Saints):**\nThose truly regenerated will persevere in faith until the end. God preserves His own; apparent apostasy reveals someone was never genuinely saved.\n\n**Arminian View (Conditional Preservation):**\n*Classical Arminians* hold that genuine believers can apostatize and lose salvation through persistent unbelief. *Many Arminians today* hold to eternal security, showing diversity within the tradition.\n\n---\n\n## Common Ground Often Overlooked\n\nBoth traditions affirm:\n- Salvation is **by grace alone** through faith\n- Human beings **cannot earn** salvation\n- **God initiates** the salvation process\n- Scripture as the final authority\n- The necessity of the Holy Spirit's work\n\n---\n\n## Denominational Distribution\n\n**Calvinist-leaning:** Reformed churches, most Presbyterians, many Baptists (particularly Southern Baptist conservatives), some Anglicans\n\n**Arminian-leaning:** Methodists, Wesleyans, Free Will Baptists, many Pentecostals, Church of the Nazarene, Assemblies of God\n\n**Mixed/Mediating positions:** Many evangelical churches contain both perspectives, and some traditions (like Lutheranism and Anglicanism) don't fit neatly into either category.\n\n---\n\n## A Gracious Observation\n\nThoughtful adherents of both positions wrestle seriously with Scripture and acknowledge tensions in their own systems. Calvinists must explain how God can genuinely desire all to be saved (1 Tim 2:4) while electing only some. Arminians must explain how salvation is \"not of him who wills\" (Rom 9:16) while maintaining decisive human choice.\n\nBoth traditions, at their best, are attempting to faithfully honor biblical texts that emphasize divine sovereignty *and* texts that emphasize human responsibility. The church has considered both positions within the bounds of orthodoxy, and Christians can hold either view with integrity while extending charity to those who differ.",

Likewise, Anglicanism and Lutheranism contain substantial diversity and cannot be cleanly labeled as fitting neatly into one side of the Calvinist–Arminian spectrum; the response acknowledges range but also makes a sweeping characterization in places.",

It also acknowledges historical development and contemporary variations, which demonstrates nuance. However, two areas lower the precision slightly: (1) the Irresistible Grace description risks misrepresenting how Calvinists typically articulate the nature of grace as effectual for the elect (often described as transformative and regenerating, not merely enabling the will without any decisive alteration); and (2) some generalizations about denominational leanings (especially regarding the SBC and the ease of fitting Anglican/Lutheran bodies into the Calvinist–Arminian binary) are overly broad or inconsistent. Overall, the content is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded, with good nuance, but would benefit from tighter wording on grace’s mechanism and more careful categorization of historic traditions."

Christ returns once at the end of this age for final judgment and eternal state.\n\n*Strengths adherents cite:* Consistent symbolic interpretation of Revelation; avoids speculative timelines; emphasizes present spiritual realities of Christ's kingdom.\n\n### **Postmillennialism**\n*Christ returns **after** the millennium*\n\nThis view, held by some **Reformed**, **Presbyterian**, and historically many **Puritan** theologians, teaches that the gospel will progressively triumph, Christianizing the world and ushering in an extended era of peace and righteousness before Christ's return.\n\n*Strengths adherents cite:* Optimistic view of gospel power; motivates cultural engagement and missions; emphasizes the kingdom's present growth.\n\n---\n\n## The Tribulation and Rapture\n\nAmong premillennialists especially, significant debate exists about the \"rapture\" (from Latin *rapio*, based on 1 Thessalonians 4:17):\n\n| View | Timing | Common Adherents |\n|------|--------|------------------|\n| **Pretribulation** | Believers removed before 7-year tribulation | Many dispensationalists, popular evangelical teaching |\n| **Midtribulation** | Rapture at tribulation's midpoint | Minority position |\n| **Posttribulation** | Believers remain through tribulation, raptured at Christ's return | Historic premillennialists, some Reformed |\n| **Pre-wrath** | Rapture before God's wrath but after tribulation begins | Growing minority view |\n\n**Amillennialists and postmillennialists** generally do not hold to a separate rapture event distinct from Christ's final return.\n\n---\n\n## Views on Israel and the Church\n\nA significant dividing line concerns the relationship between Israel and the Church:\n\n**Continuity emphasis** (Covenant theology, common in Reformed, Catholic, Orthodox traditions): The Church is the fulfillment and continuation of Israel; Old Testament promises find their ultimate fulfillment in Christ and his people.\n\n**Discontinuity emphasis** (Dispensationalism): Israel and the Church remain distinct peoples with distinct prophetic programs; God will literally fulfill territorial and national promises to ethnic Israel.\n\n**Progressive Dispensationalism** and other mediating positions seek middle ground, acknowledging both continuity and distinction.\n\n---\n\n## Eastern Orthodox Perspective\n\nThe **Orthodox** tradition tends to approach eschatology with more reserve, emphasizing:\n- The mystery of prophetic texts\n- Theosis (deification) as the goal of human existence\n- Inaugurated eschatology—eternal life begins now through sacramental participation\n- Caution about detailed prophetic speculation\n- The cosmic scope of redemption (all creation renewed)\n\n---\n\n## Roman Catholic Perspective\n\n**Catholic** teaching affirms:\n- Christ's return and general judgment\n- Particular judgment at death\n- Purgatory as purification for those who die in grace but imperfectly purified\n- Generally amillennial framework, though not dogmatically defined\n- Less emphasis on prophetic timelines, more on the \"four last things\": death, judgment, heaven, hell\n\n---\n\n## Partial Preterism vs. Futurism\n\nAnother axis of interpretation concerns **when** prophetic texts find fulfillment:\n\n**Futurists** (most premillennialists) see Revelation and Matthew 24 as primarily describing future events.\n\n**Partial Preterists** (some Reformed, postmillennialists) believe many prophecies were fulfilled in AD 70 with Jerusalem's destruction, while Christ's return and final judgment remain future.\n\n**Full Preterism** (believing all prophecy is fulfilled) is generally considered outside orthodox bounds.\n\n---\n\n## Pastoral Observations\n\nSeveral points merit consideration:\n\n1. **Humility is warranted.** Godly, learned Christians have disagreed on these matters for centuries. The Reformers held different views from many modern evangelicals; the early church showed diversity as well.\n\n2. **These are secondary issues.** Most traditions recognize eschatological views (beyond core affirmations) as matters of legitimate disagreement among believers.\n\n3. **Ethical implications matter.** Each view shapes how Christians engage culture, missions, and social issues—a consideration worth examining.\n\n4. **The purpose of prophecy** is ultimately pastoral: to encourage holiness, hope, and perseverance (1 John 3:2-3; Titus 2:11-13), not to satisfy curiosity about timelines.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe diversity of Christian eschatology reflects the genuine complexity of biblical prophetic literature and the Church's ongoing effort to understand God's purposes. While Christians should study these matters carefully and hold their convictions with integrity, they should also extend charity to fellow believers who interpret these texts differently—recognizing that our unity is in Christ himself, who *will* return, whose kingdom *will* be consummated, and whose victory *is* certain.",

It correctly notes the core promises (Christ’s return, resurrection, final judgment, new creation) and cites biblical anchors (1 Thessalonians 4:17; Matthew 24). It also highlights debates about Israel/the Church and the role of prophecy. A notable nuance gap is the characterization of Catholic eschatology as generally amillennial; Catholic teaching does not officially define a single millennial framework, and there is internal variation.

        "output": "# Spiritual Gifts: Continuationist and Cessationist Perspectives\n\nThis represents one of the significant intra-family discussions among orthodox Christians who share core commitments to the Trinity, Christ's deity and resurrection, salvation by grace through faith, and Scripture's authority.\n\n## The Central Question\n\n**Do the miraculous or \"sign\" gifts described in the New Testament—particularly tongues, prophecy, and healing—continue to operate in the church today, or did they cease with the apostolic era?**\n\n---\n\n## The Cessationist Position\n\n**Held by many Reformed, Presbyterian, and some Baptist traditions**\n\n### Core Convictions\n\n- The extraordinary gifts (tongues, prophecy, apostolic healing) served a specific foundational purpose: authenticating the apostles and establishing the early church\n- These gifts ceased when the apostolic age ended and the New Testament canon closed\n- 1 Corinthians 13:8-10 (\"when the perfect comes\") refers to the completed canon or the mature church\n- Ephesians 2:20 describes apostles and prophets as the *foundation*—foundations are laid once\n- The absence of these gifts throughout most church history supports this view\n\n### Cessationists Affirm\n- The Holy Spirit remains fully active today\n- God *can* and sometimes *does* heal miraculously in answer to prayer\n- All believers have spiritual gifts (teaching, service, encouragement, etc.)\n- They are not denying God's power but discerning His revealed pattern\n\n### Representative Voices\nB.B. Warfield, John MacArthur, R.C. Sproul, the Westminster Standards\n\n---\n\n## The Continuationist/Charismatic/Pentecostal Position\n\n**Held by Pentecostals, charismatics across denominations, and many global Christians**\n\n### Core Convictions\n\n- Scripture nowhere explicitly states these gifts would cease\n- The same Spirit who empowered the early church empowers believers today\n- \"The perfect\" in 1 Corinthians 13 refers to Christ's return, not the canon\n- Joel 2/Acts 2 describes the entire \"last days\" period until Christ returns\n- The global church's widespread experience of these gifts confirms their continuation\n\n### Important Distinctions Within This Camp\n\n- **Classical Pentecostals**: Often teach tongues as initial evidence of Spirit baptism\n- **Charismatics**: Affirm all gifts without requiring tongues as evidence\n- **Third Wave/Vineyard**: Emphasize gifts as normal Christianity without classical Pentecostal theology\n\n### Continuationists Affirm\n- All claimed prophecy must be tested against Scripture\n- Abuses don't invalidate proper use\n- The canon is closed—contemporary prophecy has different authority than Scripture\n- Gifts must operate in order and love (1 Corinthians 14)\n\n### Representative Voices\nWayne Grudem, D.A. Carson, John Piper (cautious continuationists); Gordon Fee, Craig Keener, global Pentecostal scholars\n\n---\n\n## Points of Agreement\n\nBoth sides typically affirm:\n\n1. **Scripture's final authority**—no new revelation equals or supersedes the Bible\n2. **The Spirit's ongoing ministry** in sanctification, illumination, and empowerment\n3. **The reality of spiritual gifts** operative in the church (disagreement is over *which* ones)\n4. **The danger of excess**—whether quenching the Spirit or tolerating chaos\n5. **The centrality of love**—Paul's main point in 1 Corinthians 12-14\n\n---\n\n## Pastoral Observations\n\nThis debate often generates more heat than necessary. Faithful Christians exist on both sides who:\n\n- Love Scripture and seek to obey it\n- Have experienced God's power differently\n- Bring legitimate concerns (cessationists about disorder and false claims; continuationists about limiting God and ignoring global church experience)\n\nThe witness of the majority-world church—where Christianity is growing most rapidly and charismatic experience is common—has prompted many Western cessationists to reconsider, even if they remain cautious.\n\n---\n\n## A Gracious Path Forward\n\nBoth positions can ask themselves:\n\n- **Cessationists**: \"Am I functionally limiting God based on my tradition rather than clear biblical teaching?\"\n- **Continuationists**: \"Am I testing everything carefully and prioritizing what Scripture emphasizes—love, edification, order?\"\n\nThis remains a secondary issue where charitable disagreement is appropriate among those united in the Gospel.",
