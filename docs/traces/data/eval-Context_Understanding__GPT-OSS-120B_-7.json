          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns well with biblical teaching. It reflects that Jesus used parables to convey kingdom truths in familiar, memorable form, to engage listeners, provoke reflection, and reveal truth to the receptive while concealing it from those who are hostile or indifferent. It also echoes the Messiah’s use of parables in fulfillment of prophecy (Matthew 13:10–17; Isaiah 6:9–10). This captures the core biblical dynamic of disclosure to insiders and obscurity to outsiders, and it acknowledges the interpretive aspect of parables by insiders. A minor nuance often highlighted in Scripture is that Jesus also explained parables privately to His disciples (e.g., Mark 4:34), which could be noted for completeness; otherwise the answer is solidly aligned with orthodox teaching and Scripture.)"
