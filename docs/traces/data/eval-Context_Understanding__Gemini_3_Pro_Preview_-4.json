    "expected": "Jesus' disciples and the crowds who followed him",
    "output": "Based on the text of the Gospel of Matthew and biblical scholarship, the audience of the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7) is best understood as **two-tiered**: the **disciples** serve as the primary, immediate audience, while the **crowds** serve as the secondary, \"overhearing\" audience.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the historical and textual evidence regarding these groups.\n\n### 1. The Primary Audience: The Disciples\nAccording to the narrative setup in Matthew 5:1–2, the specific target of the teaching was Jesus' committed followers.\n\n> *\"Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. And he opened his mouth and taught them...\"* (ESV)\n\nScholars emphasize that the Sermon constitutes the ethical constitution of the Kingdom of Heaven. Therefore, the instructions found within—such as the Beatitudes, the commands to turn the other cheek, and instructions on prayer—are intended for those who have already committed to following Jesus, rather than a general code of ethics for secular society.\n\n*   **Internal Evidence:** Throughout the sermon, Jesus uses the second person plural (\"You are the salt of the earth,\" \"You are the light of the world\"). This language presupposes a group distinct from the general population who are called to live by a higher, counter-cultural standard of righteousness.\n\n### 2. The Secondary Audience: The Crowds\nWhile Jesus addresses the disciples, Matthew explicitly situates them within the hearing of the \"crowds\" (*ochloi*).\n\nAt the conclusion of the Sermon, Matthew 7:28–29 states:\n> *\"And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as one who had authority...\"*\n\n*   **The Role of the Crowd:** The presence of the crowds indicates that the invitation to the Kingdom is open. In the narrative context of Matthew, the crowds represent potential disciples. By allowing them to overhear instructions given to the inner circle, Jesus effectively invites them to cross the line from interested observers to committed followers.\n\n### 3. The \"Meta\" Audience: Matthew's Community\nFrom a scholarly perspective regarding authorship and historical context, one must also consider the *literary* audience—the people for whom the Gospel of Matthew was originally written (c. 80–90 AD).\n\n*   **Jewish-Christian Context:** Most scholars agree that Matthew wrote primarily for a Jewish-Christian community struggling with their identity in relation to mainstream Judaism after the destruction of the Temple (70 AD).\n*   **The \"New Moses\":** By portraying Jesus going up a mountain to deliver the Law (just as Moses went up Sinai), Matthew presents Jesus to his readers as the definitive interpreter of the Torah. The Sermon is meant to instruct Matthew's contemporary readers on how to live as followers of the Messiah within a Jewish context, differentiating their righteousness from that of the \"scribes and Pharisees\" (Matthew 5:20).\n\n### Summary\n*   **Narrative Focus:** The **disciples** were the recipients of the instruction.\n*   **Narrative Context:** The **crowds** were present as witnesses and potential converts.\n*   **Authorial Intent:** The **Jewish-Christian church** of the late first century was the intended readership, viewing the Sermon as the definitive catechism of the Christian faith.",

          "rationale": "The response aligns with the commonly accepted scholarly position that the Sermon on the Mount is primarily directed at Jesus’ disciples (Matt 5:1–2) while the crowds are present as an overhearing audience (Matt 7:28–29). It correctly notes the narrative context (disciples as the immediate addressees) and expands with the broader literary/audience context of Matthew’s Jewish-Christian community (New Moses motif, 80–90 CE dating). It also acknowledges debate and presents a two-tier reading rather than a single, rigid interpretation, which demonstrates appropriate nuance. Minor caveats exist in scholarly opinions (some emphasize different primary addressees or vary on how strongly the crowd is targeted), but the answer remains accurate, comprehensive for the question asked, and relevant."
