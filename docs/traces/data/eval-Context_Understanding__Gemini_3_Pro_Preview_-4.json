            "Historically and biblically nuanced: traditional and scholarly readings often acknowledge a dual/audience-inclusive understanding (disciples and listeners from the crowd); the answer misses this nuance.",
            "Misses the functional purpose of the sermon: it is both instruction for disciples and proclamation to would-be followers, with ethical demands that apply to the community at large.",
            "No explicit scriptural justification provided: the response does not engage with the key verses (e.g., Matt 5:1-2) that indicate a broader audience."

          "rationale": "The Sermon on the Mount is introduced with 'seeing the crowds' and 'his disciples came to him' (Matthew 5:1–2), indicating both a public audience and a teaching for his followers. While the sermon is certainly central to Jesus’ teaching to his disciples, biblical context and traditional interpretation recognize that it is delivered in the presence of the crowd and addresses listeners who are potential followers. The LLM’s answer is therefore incomplete and not in line with the fuller biblical understanding. A more accurate response would acknowledge both groups and note the public, instructional nature of the sermon."
