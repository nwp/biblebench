    "output": "Based on the text of the Gospel of Matthew and historical context, the primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7) was **Jesus’ disciples**, though the **crowds** served as a secondary, \"overhearing\" audience.\n\nIn biblical scholarship, this distinction is crucial for understanding the intent of the sermon. It is generally understood not as an evangelistic message to convert unbelievers, but as a code of ethics and instruction for those who have already committed to following Jesus.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the audience:\n\n### 1. The Primary Audience: The Disciples (*Mathētēs*)\nThe text provides specific geographical and directional markers indicating that the teaching was directed at the inner circle of followers.\n\n*   **Textual Evidence:** Matthew 5:1–2 states, *\"Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. And he opened his mouth and taught them...\"*\n*   **The Rabbinic Posture:** By \"sitting down,\" Jesus assumed the traditional posture of a Jewish rabbi officially instructing his students.\n*   **Scholarly Consensus:** Most scholars agree that the content of the sermon—such as the Beatitudes, instructions on prayer, and the demand for a \"greater righteousness\"—presupposes a relationship with Jesus. It frames a \"Kingdom ethic\" intended for the community of believers (the New Israel) rather than the general population.\n\n### 2. The Secondary Audience: The Crowds (*Ochlos*)\nWhile the disciples were the recipients of the instruction, they were not in isolation. Jesus deliberately taught in the hearing of the masses.\n\n*   **Context:** Matthew 4:25 notes that great crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.\n*   **Textual Evidence:** The specific inclusion of the crowds is confirmed by the sermon's conclusion. Matthew 7:28–29 reports, *\"And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as one who had authority...\"*\n*   **Narrative Function:** The crowds represent potential disciples. They stand as witnesses to the authority of Jesus, distinguishing his teaching style from that of their scribes.\n\n### 3. The Ultimate Audience: The Matthean Community\nFrom a slightly different angle—regarding the authorship and composition of the Gospel—scholars note a third audience.\n\n*   **Matthew's Readers:** The Gospel of Matthew is traditionally viewed as being written for a Jewish-Christian audience in the late 1st century. Therefore, the Sermon on the Mount serves a literary function: it presents Jesus as the \"New Moses.\" Just as Moses received the Law on Mount Sinai for the Israelites, Jesus goes up a mountain to deliver the new interpretation of the Law for the Church.\n\n### Summary\nThe Sermon on the Mount functions as a set of instructions for the **disciples** (the inner circle) regarding how to live distinctively as citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven, enacted within earshot of the **crowds** (the outer circle) to invite them to recognize Jesus' authority.",

          "rationale": "The answer is largely accurate in identifying primary vs. secondary audiences and citing Matt. 5:1–2 and Matt. 4:25–7:29. However, it incorrectly claims geographic markers in Mt 5:1–2 to delineate an inner circle, which the text does not provide, and it overgeneralizes about scholarly consensus on the sermon’s evangelistic function. It does, however, acknowledge Matthean-community readership and summarizes the common scholarly framing of the sermon’s ethics for disciples within an audience that includes the crowds."
