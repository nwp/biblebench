It aligns with biblical data (Acts 22:3; Acts 7–8; Galatians 1:13–14; Philippians 3:5) and with historic Christian orthodoxy. The only nuance is the potential overstatement about his personal participation in Stephen's stoning; the text shows he approved of Stephen's death rather than necessarily throwing stones himself."
