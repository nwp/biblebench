    "expected": "Justification by faith is the doctrine that sinners are declared righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus Christ, not by their own works or merit. It is a legal declaration by God where the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, and their sins are forgiven. This justification is received through faith alone (sola fide), by grace alone (sola gratia), based on Christ's finished work alone (solus Christus).",
    "output": "**Justification by faith**  \n— *How a person becomes “righteous before God”*  \n\n---\n\n## 1. What “justification” means\n\n1. **Legal declaration** – In the covenantal (or covenant‑law) language of the Bible, to be *justified* is God's act of “declaring” or “ascribing” righteousness to someone.  \n2. **Righteousness is *imputed*** – The righteousness that is declared is not something the person has done by their own works; it is *Christ’s* righteousness that is *imputed* (or “credited”) to the believer (cf. Romans 3:24; 2 Cor 5:21).  \n3. **Instantaneous and once‑for‑all** – Justification is a one‑time legal act. Once God declares a person justified, that status is affirmed for all eternity (Romans 5:1, 5; 3 Cor 5:17).  \n4. **Separate from sanctification** – Justification is a *statement of status* before God; sanctification is the ongoing process of being made *moral* or *holy* in the life of a believer.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Biblical foundation\n\n| Scriptural Passage | Key Idea |\n|--------------------|----------|\n| **Romans 3:21‑22** | “But now the righteousness of God… is revealed through faith.” |\n| **Romans 5:1** | “Hence we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we have justified.” |\n| **2 Cor 5:21** | “God made Him… to serve as a propitiation for us, that we in Him might be... the righteousness of God.” |\n| **Ephesians 2:8‑9** | “By grace you have been saved through faith; it is not of you, but the gift of God.” |\n| **Galatians 2:16** | “A person is not justified by works of the law but by faith in Christ.” |\n| **1 Peter 1:8‑9** | “You believed for yourself… that you would receive the salvation of your souls by faith.” |\n| **John 3:16** | “For God … gave his Son… that we might have eternal life through Him.” |\n\nTogether these passages make the case that:  \n*The believer is made righteous—legally and mercifully—by standing in faith on Christ’s completed atoning work.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. How it works—stepwise explanation\n\n| Step | What Happens | Biblical witness |\n|------|--------------|------------------|\n| **1. The problem** | All men are “under sin” (Romans 3:23) and thus “dead in trespasses” (Ephesians 2:1). Sin separates us from the holiness of God. | Romans 3:23‑24 |\n| **2. Christ’s provision** | Christ, as *true Righteous One*, perfectly obeys God’s law and *satisfies** all penal and moral demands. He *does* the work that humanity is unable to do. | 1 Cor 15:3‑4; 2 Cor 5:21 |\n| **3. The legal act** | God **declares** (or *justifies*) every person who *faithfully trusts* in this finished work. The righteousness that the believer is declared to have is Christ’s, not theirs. | Romans 5:1; 2 Cor 5:12 |\n| **4. Faith as the means** | Faith is the instrument through which a person *receives* the legal declaration: He/She *believes* in Christ; the Holy Spirit *confirms* that belief. | Ephesians 2:8‑9; Gal 2:16 |\n| **5. Righteous status** | Because of that declaration, the believer is *held* as righteous before God; no longer legally guilty or blameless, but *justified as if* He had never sinned. | Romans 5:1.5:5 |\n| **6. The ongoing life** | While the justification is a legal status, believers are called to live in its reality—facing sanctification by cooperation with grace. | Ephesians 2:10 |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why faith?  \n*Faith is needed for two reasons:*\n\n1. **Personal response** – Faith is the human *accepting* of what Christ has done. Without faith, the provision remains unclaimed. (Romans 10:9‑10)\n2. **Spiritual medium** – The Holy Spirit *confirms* faith to the believer’s heart and *imparts* the new status of being justified. (John 14:26)\n\n---\n\n## 5. “Righteous before God”—what this really means\n\n* *Legal righteousness* – We are treated by God as if we have no sin (Romans 5:12; 2 Cor 5:17).  \n* *Reconciliation* – The broken relationship between a righteous God and a sinful human is re‑established (Romans 5:18‑19).  \n* *Grace‑based status* – Righteousness is given, not earned. (Gal 2:16; Ephesians 2:8)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Contrast with other doctrines  \n\n| Tradition | Core View of Justification |\n|-----------|---------------------------|\n| **Reformation (Protestant)** | *Sola fide*: one is justified <i>by faith alone</i>, the righteousness is “imputed” entirely from Christ’s perfection. |\n| **Catholic/Orthodox** | The believer is *justified* through a gift of grace, and *works* (co‑operative charity) express that grace. Righteousness both *imputed* and *inducted* through sanctifying grace. |\n| **Lutheran** | “Crucial is one legal act of God called justification” (Sola fide), followed by sanctification. |\n\nAll traditions agree that at the center of justification is God’s declaration of a believer’s righteousness, but they differ in whether works play a part in attaining or maintaining that status.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Take‑away\n\n1. **Justification is God’s gift, not human merit.**  \n2. **Faith is the way *in*.**  \n3. **Christ’s perfect obedience is the *basis* of the declaration.**  \n4. **Being “righteous before God” is a legal status of being declared righteous, not an ongoing moral perfection.**  \n5. **Our life after justification (sanctification) reflects that new status, but does not reverse or annul it.**\n\nIn Scripture, the assurance of justification is: *Believe in Christ, and you are declared righteous before God—by grace, through faith, forever secured* (Ephesians 2:8‑9; Romans 5:1, 17).",

It emphasizes the core ideas that Christ’s righteousness is imputed to the believer and that justification is a one-time act received by faith. It also correctly notes the distinction between justification and sanctification and briefly mentions how faith functions (as the instrumental means and Spirit’s work)."

          "explanation": "Overall, the response presents a standard Protestant, Reformation-era doctrine of justification by faith alone with imputed righteousness. It correctly locates justification as a legal declaration, credits Christ’s righteousness to the believer, emphasizes faith as the means, and distinguishes justification from sanctification. There are no explicit heresies (e.g., Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism) in the content. However, there are several minor issues to note:\n\n- Typographical and citation problems: Several references are garbled or mis-cited (e.g., Romans 5:1.5:5; 2 Cor 5:12 cited in contexts where it does not address imputation; inconsistent use of 2 Cor 5:17 vs. 2 Cor 5:5). These are editorial/technical errors rather than doctrinal ones, but they can confuse readers and undermine precision.\n- Potential nuance obscured by phrasing: The article treats justification as a one-time legal act and separation from sanctification, which is orthodox in Protestant theology. Some Lutheran and Anglican perspectives emphasize the ongoing relationship between faith and works more explicitly (e.g., simul iustus et peccator in Lutheran thought, or the Catholic emphasis on infused grace and cooperation). The section comparing traditions could be more nuanced than the blanket claim that all traditions center on a declaration of righteousness.\n- Assurance language: The Take-away “forever secured” reflects a traditional Protestant view of perseverance/eternal security. While common in Reformed and many evangelical traditions, it is a contested topic in other streams (e.g., some Arminian or Wesleyan positions). The text would benefit from clarifying that assurance rests on God’s faithfulness and the believer’s perseverance, rather than implying unconditional eternal security without caveat.\n- Minor doctrinal nuance worth clarifying: While equating imputed righteousness with Christ’s righteousness is standard, the phrase in 2 Corinthians 5:21 can be read as both the believer becoming righteous and the believer being treated as righteous. The explanation could explicitly distinguish imputation (Christ’s righteousness credited to us) from a transformation of our own righteousness through sanctification.\n\nIn sum, the content is orthodox and sound as a summary of justification by faith. The issues are primarily editorial (citation accuracy, phrasing) and contextual (nuanced differences among traditions, implications of assurance). Addressing these would enhance precision without introducing doctrinal error."
