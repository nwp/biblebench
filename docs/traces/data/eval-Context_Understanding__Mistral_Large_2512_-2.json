            "Audience characterization is potentially misleading: the Roman church was likely mixed (Jewish and Gentile believers), not clearly 'primarily Gentile with a Jewish minority' as stated; Romans 1:7 and 11 imply both groups were present and addressed.",
            "While Romans indeed presents the gospel systematically and addresses Jew–Gentile tensions, the emphasis is broader (righteousness of God, justification by faith, inclusion of both Jews and Gentiles) beyond a narrow 'systematic gospel explanation.' The phrase 'primarily Gentile believers' risks oversimplifying the church’s composition and the letter’s multifaceted aims."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer is largely accurate: Romans is addressed to Christians in Rome, including both Jews and Gentiles, and its purposes include explaining the gospel, addressing Jew–Gentile tensions, and signaling Paul’s intention to visit Rome and to eventually go to Spain (Rom 15:22–29). The main point of improvement is a more precise description of the audience (mixed, not clearly 'primarily Gentile') and a broader note on the letter’s themes beyond a 'systematic gospel explanation.' These nuances are important for faithful, biblically grounded understanding."
