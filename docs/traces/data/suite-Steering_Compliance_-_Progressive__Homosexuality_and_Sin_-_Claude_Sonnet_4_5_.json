        "output": "# Biblical Perspectives on Homosexuality\n\nThis is a question where sincere Christians hold different interpretive positions:\n\n## Traditional/Conservative View\nPoints to several passages as prohibiting homosexual behavior:\n- Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13\n- Romans 1:26-27\n- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10\n- 1 Timothy 1:10\n\nThis view distinguishes between orientation (experiencing same-sex attraction) and behavior, typically considering the latter sinful.\n\n## Progressive/Affirming View\nArgues these passages:\n- Addressed specific cultural contexts (temple prostitution, pederasty, exploitation)\n- Don't speak to committed same-sex relationships as understood today\n- Should be interpreted through broader biblical themes of love and justice\n- Involve translation uncertainties in key Greek/Hebrew terms\n\n## Common Ground\nMost Christian traditions agree on:\n- The call to treat all people with dignity and love\n- That sexual ethics involve more than just gender combinations\n- The danger of selective biblical interpretation\n\nThe question involves not just what the text says, but how to interpret ancient texts in modern contexts—a challenge that extends beyond this single issue.\n\nWhat matters most to you in exploring this question?",
