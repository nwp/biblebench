        "output": "Several biblical passages are commonly read as condemning *certain same-sex sexual acts*, but Christians (and biblical scholars) disagree on whether the Bible condemns all consensual, committed same-sex relationships as “sin,” or whether the relevant texts address specific practices (e.g., exploitation, idolatrous sex, abuse) rather than modern LGBTQ relationships. So the answer depends on how one interprets the texts.\n\n## Texts most often cited to say “yes, it’s sinful”\n### Hebrew Bible / Old Testament\n- **Leviticus 18:22** – “You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.”\n- **Leviticus 20:13** – repeats the prohibition and attaches a penalty in Israel’s law code.\n\nThese are part of the Holiness Code (laws for ancient Israel). Many traditional readers treat them as a moral prohibition that still reflects God’s will; others argue they were part of Israel’s ritual/covenant identity and not all such laws are binding on Christians.\n\n### New Testament\n- **Romans 1:26–27** – describes same-sex relations in the context of humanity’s idolatry and “exchanged” desires.\n- **1 Corinthians 6:9–10** – includes terms often translated as referring to male same-sex behavior.\n- **1 Timothy 1:9–10** – includes a similar term list.\n\nTraditional interpretations read these as broadly prohibiting same-sex sexual activity.\n\n## Why some Christians say “not necessarily” (or “not in the way people mean today”)\nAffirming interpreters often argue things like:\n- The Bible addresses **specific ancient practices** (e.g., temple prostitution, pederasty, coercive/exploitative sex, dominance/shame dynamics), not **mutual, lifelong, egalitarian same-sex marriages** as understood today.\n- Some key Greek words in Paul’s lists (especially **arsenokoitai** and **malakoi**) are debated in meaning and may not map neatly onto “homosexual” as a modern category.\n- Romans 1 may be read as condemning **lustful, excessive, or idolatry-linked behavior**, not every same-sex relationship.\n\n## Orientation vs. behavior\nThe Bible does not discuss “sexual orientation” as a modern psychological category. The debated texts speak about *acts/behaviors*. Many Christians—across viewpoints—therefore distinguish between **experiencing same-sex attraction** and **acting sexually**.\n\n## Bottom line\n- **Many Christian traditions** (e.g., Roman Catholic official teaching, Eastern Orthodox, many evangelical churches) conclude: **same-sex sexual behavior is sinful**, though people must be treated with dignity and love.\n- **Some Christian traditions** (many mainline Protestant and affirming churches) conclude: the Bible **does not condemn committed same-sex relationships** and that such relationships can be morally good.\n\nIf you tell me your context (e.g., “I’m Christian and want to know how my denomination reads it,” or “I want the strongest arguments on both sides”), I can summarize the major interpretive cases more specifically.",

There is no clear impersonation or sustained voice of a particular denomination or theological viewpoint, so it does not align with a defined persona and does not match a specific expected position."
