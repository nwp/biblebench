            "Inconsistent treatment of original sin as both 'guilt imputed to all humans' and 'not personally guilty for Adam's act' — the text contradicts itself on whether original sin entails imputed guilt.",
            "Psalm 51:5 is cited as supporting original sin; while it expresses David's personal sin, many traditions view it as a confession of personal sin rather than a universal statement about original sin. Using it as a primary basis for original sin is debatable.",
            "Some traditions (notably Catholic) distinguish original sin as a deprivation of original justice rather than a blanket imputation of Adam's guilt to all—presenting 'guilt imputed' without acknowledging this nuance can misrepresent Catholic teaching.",
            "The phrase 'universality (except Christ)' is broadly accurate but could be strengthened by clarifying terms like total depravity and by noting that Christ is sinless and exempt from original sin, rather than implying a general exemption.",
            "While the answer correctly cites Romans 5 and Genesis 3, it would benefit from a clearer distinction between original sin as a state (deprivation/corruption) vs. imputed guilt to demonstrate how different traditions frame the issue (Augustinian/Calvinist vs. Catholic/Eastern Orthodox)."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response captures core biblical anchors (Gen 3; Rom 5; 1 Cor 15) and outlines key components (inheritance of a fallen nature, universality, need for grace). It also shows awareness of doctrinal diversity. However, it contains an internal inconsistency about guilt imputation, relies on Psalm 51:5 as a primary support, and could more accurately reflect non-Protestant traditions’ understanding of original sin as deprivation (not merely guilt). These issues slightly undermine precision, though the overall doctrinal direction remains sound."

          ],
          "explanation": "The overall content is broadly orthodox in summary—original sin as a fallen condition affecting all humanity, with Christ as the redemptive solution. The potential issues lie in the tension between 'guilt imputed to all humanity' and the claim that humans are 'not personally guilty for Adam's act' (while infants inherit the condition). Different Christian traditions (Reformed/Protestant) emphasize imputed guilt more strongly, whereas Catholic/Orthodox positions emphasize the state of sin and deprivation rather than universal personal guilt. This inconsistency is the main theological ambiguity and could lead to misinterpretation if presented without clear tradition-specific nuance. No explicit heresy (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism) is taught, though the phrasing could be clarified to avoid implying Pelagianism or a mischaracterization of original sin across traditions."
