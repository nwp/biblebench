    "expected": "Justification by faith is the doctrine that sinners are declared righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus Christ, not by their own works or merit. It is a legal declaration by God where the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, and their sins are forgiven. This justification is received through faith alone (sola fide), by grace alone (sola gratia), based on Christ's finished work alone (solus Christus).",
    "output": "# Justification by Faith\n\n## Definition\n\n**Justification** is God's judicial act of declaring a sinner righteous on the basis of Christ's work, received through faith alone. It is a legal verdict, not a process of moral transformation—though it necessarily accompanies and initiates such transformation.\n\n## The Core Problem\n\nScripture establishes humanity's fundamental predicament: \"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23). God's holiness demands perfect righteousness, yet humans possess none of their own merit. We stand guilty before a just Judge.\n\n## The Ground of Justification\n\nRighteousness before God comes not through human effort but through **imputation**—the crediting of Christ's righteousness to the believer's account:\n\n- Christ lived the perfect life we could not live\n- Christ died the death we deserved to die\n- His righteousness is reckoned to those who believe (Romans 4:5-6, 2 Corinthians 5:21)\n\nThis is the \"great exchange\": our sin credited to Christ at the cross; His righteousness credited to us through faith.\n\n## The Instrument: Faith Alone\n\n\"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast\" (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\nFaith is the *instrument*, not the *basis*. We are justified **by grace alone**, **through faith alone**, **in Christ alone**. Faith itself contributes no merit—it simply receives what God freely gives.\n\n## Faith and Works\n\nJames 2:17 (\"faith without works is dead\") does not contradict Paul. Genuine justifying faith inevitably produces works as *evidence*, not *cause*. We are justified by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone.\n\n---\n\n*Soli Deo Gloria*",

          "rationale": "The response faithfully presents justification by faith as a legal declaration by God, grounded in Christ’s work and received by faith alone, which aligns with historic Protestant teaching (sola gratia, sola fide, solus Christus). It correctly uses imputation (Christ’s righteousness credited to the believer) and distinguishes justification from sanctification, while acknowledging that true faith will produce good works as evidence, not as the ground of justification. Scripture references cited (Rom 3:23; Rom 4:5-6; 2 Cor 5:21; Eph 2:8-9; James 2:17) support the main claims. It also harmonizes Paul and James by distinguishing faith that justifies from dead faith. Nuanced notes that could further deepen accuracy include explicit discussion of regeneration and the believer’s union with Christ, but the core doctrine is sound and biblically grounded."

          "explanation": "The response articulates classic historic Christian orthodoxy on justification: it is a forensic act of God declaring the believer righteous on the basis of Christ’s work, received by faith alone (imputed righteousness), not by human merit. It upholds the sola fide framework (grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone) and treats works as evidence of genuine faith, not the ground of justification. It references key biblical texts (Romans 3, Romans 4:5–6, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Ephesians 2:8–9) and avoids doctrinal errors associated with Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, etc. The only nuanced discussion is the common Protestant distinction between forensic justification and sanctification; some traditions emphasize transformation as part of justification, but the text explicitly keeps justification as forensic while acknowledging transformative fruit. Overall, no heresy is detected."
