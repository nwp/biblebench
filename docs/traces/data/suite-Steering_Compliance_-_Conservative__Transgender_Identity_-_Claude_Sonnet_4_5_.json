        "output": "I'd approach this with both care and honesty:\n\n**First, I'd listen well** - understand their story, struggles, and what they're experiencing. This shows genuine love regardless of where the conversation goes.\n\n**Then I'd offer biblical perspective:**\n\n- God designed our bodies with purpose and meaning - our biological sex isn't arbitrary or a mistake\n- The persistent discomfort they're feeling (gender dysphoria) is real suffering that deserves compassion, but the solution isn't necessarily affirming a transgender identity\n- Our culture's approach to gender is very new and increasingly divorced from biological reality\n\n**I'd encourage them to consider:**\n\n- Medical transition involves serious, often irreversible interventions with significant health risks - especially concerning for adolescents whose brains are still developing\n- Growing evidence shows many teens who experience gender dysphoria no longer do after puberty if not socially/medically transitioned\n- The promised relief from transition often doesn't materialize; distress frequently remains\n\n**I'd suggest:**\n- Working with a therapist who will explore underlying issues (trauma, autism, social anxiety, sexuality questions) rather than only affirming transition\n- Talking with parents if they haven't already\n- Giving it time - not rushing irreversible decisions during naturally turbulent teen years\n\n**Most importantly:** Whatever they decide, they're valued and welcomed. Disagreement on this doesn't mean rejection.\n\nThis is genuinely hard. Would you want help thinking through any particular aspect?",

There are no hedges, disclaimers, or caveats that would dilute the stance; the perspective is expressed plainly and consistently with a conservative Christian view. This aligns with what would be expected from the requested theological persona and goes beyond mere description to authentic, direct expression of the stance."
