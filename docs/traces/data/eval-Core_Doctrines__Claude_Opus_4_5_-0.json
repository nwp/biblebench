    "expected": "The Trinity is the Christian doctrine that God exists as three distinct persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) who are coequal and coeternal, yet remain one God in essence and substance. This is a mystery that transcends human comprehension - not three gods (tritheism) nor one person in three modes (modalism), but one God in three persons who are distinct yet inseparable in their divine nature and work.",
    "output": "# The Doctrine of the Trinity\n\n## The Core Affirmation\n\nThe Trinity is Christianity's central and most distinctive doctrine: **God is one divine Being who eternally exists as three distinct Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—each fully God, yet not three Gods but one God.**\n\nThis is not a contradiction (1+1+1=3 gods) but a mystery of divine nature: one *what* (essence/being), three *whos* (persons).\n\n---\n\n## Biblical Foundation\n\n### The Oneness of God\n- \"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one\" (Deuteronomy 6:4)\n- \"There is no God but one\" (1 Corinthians 8:4)\n\n### The Threeness of Persons\n\n**Each is identified as God:**\n- The Father is God (1 Peter 1:2)\n- The Son is God (John 1:1, 20:28; Hebrews 1:8)\n- The Spirit is God (Acts 5:3-4; 2 Corinthians 3:17)\n\n**Each is distinct from the others:**\n- The Father sends the Son (John 3:16)\n- The Son prays to the Father (John 17)\n- The Spirit proceeds from the Father (John 15:26)\n\n**All three appear together:**\n- Christ's baptism (Matthew 3:16-17)\n- The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19)\n- Apostolic benediction (2 Corinthians 13:14)\n\n---\n\n## Key Theological Distinctions\n\n| What the Trinity IS | What the Trinity is NOT |\n|---------------------|------------------------|\n| One God in three Persons | Three Gods (tritheism) |\n| Three eternal distinctions | One Person wearing three \"masks\" (modalism) |\n| Co-equal Persons | A hierarchy of lesser beings (Arianism) |\n\nThe Persons are distinguished by **eternal relations of origin**:\n- The Father is unbegotten\n- The Son is eternally begotten of the Father\n- The Spirit eternally proceeds from the Father (and the Son, in Western theology)\n\n---\n\n## Addressing the \"How\" Question\n\nYou ask how this can be. Honestly, we must acknowledge:\n\n**1. It is mystery, not contradiction.** A contradiction would be \"one God and three Gods\" or \"one Person and three Persons.\" The doctrine affirms one *essence*, three *persons*—different categories.\n\n**2. Human analogies fail.** Water's three states, a three-leaf clover, a man who is father/son/husband—all collapse into heresy upon examination. God's being is *sui generis* (unique to itself).\n\n**3. It is revealed, not reasoned.** We don't arrive at the Trinity through logic but receive it through Scripture. As Augustine said, \"If you comprehend it, it is not God.\"\n\n---\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThe Trinity isn't abstract speculation—it grounds:\n\n- **Salvation**: The Father sends, the Son accomplishes, the Spirit applies redemption\n- **Prayer**: Through the Son, by the Spirit, to the Father (Ephesians 2:18)\n- **Love**: God didn't *become* loving; love existed eternally between Persons (John 17:24)\n- **Community**: Human relationality reflects the relational God in whose image we're made\n\n---\n\n## Historic Formulation\n\nThe Nicene Creed (325/381 AD) and Athanasian Creed crystallized the biblical teaching against heresies. The church didn't *invent* the Trinity—it *recognized* what Scripture revealed and guarded it with precise language.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to explore any aspect further—perhaps the historical controversies, the filioque debate, or practical implications for worship?",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately presents the Trinity as one God in three eternally distinct persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who are coequal and coeternal. It aligns with core biblical data: monotheism (Deut 6:4; 1 Cor 8:4), the deity of each Person (John 1:1; 20:28; Heb 1:8; Acts 5:3-4), distinct personal relations (John 3:16; John 17), and triadic appearances (Matt 3:16-17; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14). It also correctly notes the orthodox distillation against tritheism, modalism, and Arianism, and it mentions eternal relations of origin (Father unbegotten, Son eternally begotten, Spirit eternally proceeds) with awareness of Western filioque nuance. The response treats Trinity as a mystery rather than a contradiction and acknowledges the limitations of human analogies, while grounding the doctrine in Scripture and historic creeds (Nicene/Athanasian). Minor gaps could be addressed (e.g., expanding on immanent vs. economic Trinity and clarifying language around procession in Eastern vs Western theology), but there are no theological errors.}"

          "explanation": "The response articulates orthodox Trinitarian teaching: one God in three eternal, distinct Persons (Father, Son, Spirit) who are each fully God yet not three Gods. It uses standard biblical references, acknowledges the mystery of the Trinity, and explicitly rejects common heresies (modalism, Arianism, tritheism). It also notes the historical creeds (Nicene, Athanasian) as safeguards of orthodoxy. The brief nod to the filioque issue reflects historical Western theology rather than a departure from orthodoxy. Overall, there is no heretical content in the response."
