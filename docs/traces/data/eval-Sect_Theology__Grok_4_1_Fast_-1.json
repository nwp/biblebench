    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "### Orthodox Christian Theology on the Trinity/Godhead\n\nHistoric Christian theology, as articulated in the Nicene Creed (325 AD, expanded 381 AD) and affirmed by Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant traditions, teaches the doctrine of the **Trinity**: one eternal God existing in three co-equal, co-eternal Persons—Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit—who share the same divine essence (*homoousios*, or \"of one substance\"). God is spirit (John 4:24), immutable, omnipresent, and without physical form except in the incarnate Son. The three Persons are distinct in their relations (e.g., the Father begets the Son eternally, the Spirit proceeds from the Father and/or Son), but there is no division in God's unity or being. This is derived primarily from Scripture (e.g., Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14) and clarified against heresies like Arianism (denying Christ's full divinity) or modalism (confusing the Persons).\n\n### Areas of Agreement\nA person affirming belief in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as taught in Latter-day Saint (LDS) scriptures (Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price) *alongside* the Bible shares some surface-level parallels with orthodox Christianity:\n- **Threefold acknowledgment**: Both traditions baptize \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\" (Matthew 28:19; cf. 3 Nephi 11:23–27 in the Book of Mormon, which mirrors this phrasing).\n- **Roles in salvation**: The Father sends the Son, who atones through His death and resurrection, with the Spirit testifying and sanctifying (e.g., 2 Nephi 31:21 in the Book of Mormon speaks of being \"one\" with them in purpose).\n- **Deity of Christ and Spirit**: LDS scriptures affirm Jesus as divine (e.g., Mosiah 15:1–4) and the Holy Spirit as a revelatory influence, aligning with biblical emphasis on their divine work.\n\nThese commonalities reflect LDS self-identification as Christian, viewing their teachings as a restoration of primitive Christianity.\n\n### Key Areas of Departure\nHowever, the LDS understanding of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—drawn especially from later revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants (D&C) and Pearl of Great Price (PoGP)—fundamentally diverges from historic Trinitarian orthodoxy in ontology (the nature of being), unity, and scriptural authority. These differences render it a distinct theology, often described by orthodox Christians as **tritheistic** (three separate gods) or **henotheistic** (worship of one God among many), rather than monotheistic Trinitarianism.\n\n1. **Ontological Distinction vs. Unity of Essence**:\n   - **Orthodox**: One God (*monotheism*), three Persons in one undivided essence. The Father is not the Son, nor the Spirit the Father, but they are not three gods (Athanasian Creed: \"neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the Substance\").\n   - **LDS**: Three *separate and distinct beings* (personages) united only by will and purpose, not essence. Joseph Smith's First Vision (PoGP, Joseph Smith—History 1:17) depicts the Father and Son as two physical personages. D&C 130:22 states: \"The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost... is a personage of Spirit.\" This corporeal Father contrasts with the Bible's portrayal of God as incorporeal spirit (John 4:24; Luke 24:39). Early Book of Mormon passages (e.g., Alma 11:44; 2 Nephi 31:21) use \"one God\" language suggestive of modalism or Trinitarianism, but later prophets (e.g., Joseph Smith in the King Follett Discourse, canonized in PoGP teachings) clarified this as three gods, with the Father formerly a man who progressed to godhood.\n\n2. **Nature of Divinity and Eternal Progression**:\n   - **Orthodox**: God is eternally God—uncreated, unchanging (Malachi 3:6; Hebrews 13:8), the only true God (Isaiah 43:10; 44:6–8). No progression or plurality of gods.\n   - **LDS**: God the Father is an exalted man from a previous world, and humans can become gods through eternal progression (D&C 132:19–20; PoGP, Abraham 3). This introduces a plurality of gods (D&C 132:37: \"the same light... was the Spirit of God... and he is one of the Gods\"; cf. Lorenzo Snow couplet: \"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be\"). Orthodox Christianity views this as contradicting biblical monotheism (e.g., Deuteronomy 6:4; 1 Corinthians 8:4–6).\n\n3. **Scriptural Authority and Interpretation**:\n   - **Orthodox**: The Bible (66–73 books, depending on tradition) is the sole infallible rule, interpreted through creeds, councils, and tradition. Additional texts are rejected if they contradict it.\n   - **LDS**: An open canon including the Book of Mormon (translated by Joseph Smith), D&C (modern revelations), and PoGP (e.g., Book of Abraham, Visions of Moses). These are seen as \"another testament of Jesus Christ,\" but they reframe biblical doctrines (e.g., Moses 1:6 in PoGP affirms \"one God,\" yet contextually fits LDS plurality). Historic Christianity deems these non-inspired, as they emerged in the 19th century without apostolic continuity.\n\n### Implications and Respectful Assessment\nFrom an orthodox perspective, this LDS view departs significantly from historic Christianity by rejecting the Trinitarian formulation as a post-apostolic corruption (e.g., LDS Articles of Faith 1 repudiates creeds). It aligns more with ancient views like those of Arius (separate beings) or later restorationist movements, but introduces novel elements like embodied gods and human deification absent in patristic consensus.\n\nLatter-day Saints offer a coherent system emphasizing personal revelation and family eternal progression, which resonates biblically for them (e.g., Psalm 82:6; John 10:34). Nonetheless, orthodox theologians (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant) do not recognize LDS baptism or ordinances as valid due to this non-Trinitarian Godhead, viewing it as a different religion despite shared terminology.\n\nFor deeper study: Compare Nicene Creed with LDS \"The Living Christ\" (2000) or D&C 20:17–28. This analysis aims for fairness, honoring LDS devotion while clarifying doctrinal boundaries upheld for 1,700+ years.",

            "The assertion that early Book of Mormon passages like Alma 11:44 or 2 Nephi 31:21 use a straightforward 'one God' language implying modalism is an oversimplification and not universally representative of how Mormon theology reads those passages; the Book of Mormon presents a complex 하나님head that LDS interpreters relate to the Godhead in a way distinct from historic Trinitarian orthodoxy.",
            "While the response notes LDS beliefs about the Godhead (three beings united in will), it could more clearly distinguish between doctrinal assertions (three distinct beings) and the LN-wide claim of being one Godhead in purpose; some LDS commentators would phrase this differently (unity of purpose in one Godhead rather than 'three separate gods').",
            "The claim that orthodox Christians universally reject LDS baptism and ordinances as valid due to a non-Trinitarian Godhead is broadly true in traditional ecumenical settings, but there are nuances and historical exceptions in ecumenical dialogue; the statement could acknowledge that some groups engage in ongoing discussions about legitimacy rather than asserting a universal unanimity across all historic churches."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer is largely aligned with historic Christian orthodoxy: it correctly articulates the doctrine of the Trinity, the nature of God as Spirit, and the major lines of difference with LDS theology (ontological three beings vs. one essence, additional scriptural canons, doctrine of exaltation). It also correctly notes the authority differences between a traditionally closed biblical canon and the LDS open canon. The main issues are (1) a factual misplacement regarding King Follett discourse as canonical inside PoGP, (2) an oversimplified read of Book of Mormon evidence for 'one God' language that risks portraying LDS readings as modalistic, and (3) a somewhat blunt assertion about baptismal illegitimacy that could benefit from nuanced ecumenical context. Overall, it remains a solid, nuanced comparison, with a few treatable factual inaccuracies that should be corrected for precision."
