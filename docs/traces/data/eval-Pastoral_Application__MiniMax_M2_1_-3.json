    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "# When the Unthinkable Happens: A Pastoral Response to Profound Grief\n\nDear beloved brother or sister in Christ,\n\nI am deeply sorry for the loss of your child. There is no word adequate to the weight of what you are carrying. The death of a child is contrary to the natural order of creation—it defies what our hearts expect and what our souls long for. Your grief is sacred, your questions are honest, and your pain is seen.\n\nLet me speak to you with both truth and tenderness, because you deserve neither shallow answers nor silent platitudes.\n\n## I Cannot Explain What I Cannot Understand\n\nFirst, I want you to know that I do not have a neat theological box that contains this tragedy. I do not know why your child died. I do not know why car accidents happen, why brakes fail, why other drivers make fatal choices, why a seemingly healthy young life can be taken in an instant. If I claimed to have these answers, I would be lying to you—and I will not add deception to your grief.\n\nWhat I do know is this: the God of the Bible is not a distant philosopher who observes human suffering from heaven's balcony. The God we worship is the One who entered our suffering definitively and permanently in Jesus Christ. When Mary and Martha's brother Lazarus died, we are told something remarkable: \"Jesus wept\" (John 11:35). He wept not because he didn't know he would raise Lazarus. He wept because grief is real, loss is devastating, and love expresses itself in tears.\n\n## The Limits of \"Everything Happens for a Reason\"\n\nI want to gently push back against the well-meaning phrases that have been offered to you, not because those who spoke them were cruel, but because some of these answers can feel like they minimize the enormity of your loss.\n\nWhen people say \"it's God's will,\" they often mean well, but this can inadvertently suggest that God actively chose to take your child—which contradicts the character of a loving Father who \"does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone\" (Lamentations 3:33). The biblical picture is that God is grieved by death precisely because death is not part of his original design. Sin and entropy entered the world through human rebellion, and until Christ returns to make all things new, we live in a world where cars crash, bodies fail, and tragedies occur.\n\nDoes God permit these events? Yes. Is God sovereign over all of history? Absolutely. But sovereignty does not mean desire—God does not delight in the death of your child any more than he delighted in the death of his own Son. What happened to your boy or girl was a consequence of living in a fallen world where free will exists, physics operates, and tragedy is real.\n\n## What I Can Tell You With Confidence\n\nHere is what Scripture offers to your broken heart:\n\n**God is near to the brokenhearted.** The psalmist wrote, \"The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit\" (Psalm 34:18). Close. Not distant. Not indifferent. Close. In your most alone moments, in your darkest nights, in the silence of a room that no longer holds your child's laughter—the God of the universe is nearer to you than your own heartbeat.\n\n**Your child is safe in the arms of Jesus.** Whatever your child's relationship with Christ was in this life, if they belonged to him, they are now perfectly safe, perfectly known, perfectly loved, and free from all the sorrow and suffering that marked their time on earth. Death is not the end for those who trust in Christ—it is the doorway to unhindered joy.\n\n**Grief is not a failure of faith.** There is no stage of grief you are \"supposed\" to be in. There is no timeline for healing. Jesus wept at Lazarus's tomb before he raised him from the dead. Weeping is not weakness; it is the appropriate response to death in a world that should not have death.\n\n**You will not always feel this way.** The apostle Paul wrote that \"weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning\" (Psalm 30:5). This does not mean your loss will become insignificant—time will not make you forget your child. But it does mean that the sharpness of this grief will soften, and in its place will come a peace that only God can give, and a hope that this life is not all there is.\n\n## Holding Onto Faith in the Dark\n\nI want to encourage you to bring your questions honestly to God. The Psalms are full of cries of anguish—\"Why, God? Where are you? How long?\" These prayers are not sin; they are the language of a child who knows their Father can handle their sorrow. Job, after losing everything, demanded answers from God. And what did God do? God did not strike him down for his questions. God came to him in the storm and allowed him to voice his pain.\n\nSome questions will not be answered this side of eternity. But this much I can promise: the God who holds your child's future also holds yours. He is not confused by your grief, not offended by your tears, not distant from your pain. He is right there with you, as he was with Christ in the garden, as he was with the women at the tomb, as he has been with every saint who has walked through the valley of the shadow of death.\n\n## Practical Steps Toward Healing\n\nYou are not meant to walk through this alone. I encourage you to:\n\nFind a pastor, counselor, or mature Christian friend who will sit with you in your pain without trying to fix it. You need people who will let you grieve honestly and will remind you of truth when the fog becomes too thick.\n\nCling to community. The body of Christ is meant to bear one another's burdens. Let people bring meals. Let people sit with you in silence. Let people hold you while you cry. This is not weakness; it is the body of Christ functioning as God intended.\n\nContinue to bring your child before God—not as a bargaining chip, but as an act of love and faith. Pray for your child's memory, for your other children if you have them, for the friends and family who loved your child, for the witnesses to the accident who may carry their own trauma.\n\nRemember that your child is not gone forever. If Christ is Lord, this separation is temporary. You will see your child again. That is not wishful thinking; it is the promise of a God who cannot lie.\n\n## A Word of Hope\n\nThe cross of Jesus Christ is God's answer to every parent's worst nightmare. There, God watched his own Son die. There, he experienced what you are experiencing—the death of the one he loved most. And there, he proved that even death could not have the final word.\n\nBecause of the cross, death is not the end. Because of the resurrection, your child's life had meaning, and their death has purpose in the larger story of God's redemption. I know that may not make sense right now, and that's okay. Faith is not about understanding everything; it's about trusting the One who does.\n\nYour child was a gift. Gifts can be taken away, but they are never wasted. The love you shared, the memories you hold, the person your child became—these are eternal. They matter to God, and they matter forever.\n\n## A Prayer for You\n\nGracious God, I lift up this grieving parent into your tender care. You who were acquainted with grief, who wept at the tomb of Lazarus, who endured the cross for the joy set before you—be present with this beloved brother or sister now. Let them feel your nearness. Give them people who will love them well. Grant them sleep when they are exhausted, peace when their thoughts race, and hope when the darkness feels overwhelming. Protect them from those who would offer shallow answers or rush them toward \"moving on.\" Instead, surround them with your presence, your people, and your profound peace. In the name of the One who sympathizes with our weaknesses, even Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nYou are held. You are loved. And you are not alone.\n\nWith deepest compassion,\n\nYour Pastor",

The distinction between 'will' and 'delight' is subtle but important and should be handled carefully to avoid implying God merely tolerates tragedies without purposeful redemptive aim.",
            "The pastoral claim 'Your child is safe in the arms of Jesus' can be comforting but presumes the child’s salvation; in cases of infants or uncertain faith, this may not be something certain to state. It might be preferable to acknowledge trust in Christ’s mercy and the hope of resurrection while recognizing the mystery of individual salvation."

          "rationale": "The response largely aligns with orthodox Christian teaching: it rejects fatalistic determinism, affirms God's sovereignty and presence in grief, and points to Scripture (e.g., Psalm 34:18; John 11:35; Psalm 30:5; Lamentations 3:33) to offer biblical consolation. It also emphasizes the distinction between God’s sovereign control and the existence of a fallen world where tragedies occur, and it prescribes practical pastoral steps. A minor caveat concerns phrasing around the death of Jesus and the certainty of a child’s salvation; these require careful pastoral nuance to avoid misrepresenting divine sovereignty or the specifics of an individual’s salvation status."
