    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "# The Doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body\n\n## Core Definition\n\nThe resurrection of the body is the Christian teaching that at the end of history, God will raise all people bodily from the dead for final judgment, and believers will receive glorified, imperishable bodies for eternal life with God.\n\n## Biblical Foundation\n\n**Old Testament Hints:**\n- Job 19:25-27 - \"I know that my Redeemer lives... in my flesh I shall see God\"\n- Daniel 12:2 - \"Many who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake\"\n- Isaiah 26:19 - \"Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise\"\n\n**New Testament Teaching:**\n- **1 Corinthians 15** (the primary text) - Paul argues the resurrection is essential to Christian faith\n- **John 5:28-29** - Jesus promises all will hear His voice and come out of the tombs\n- **Philippians 3:20-21** - Christ will transform our lowly bodies to be like His glorious body\n- **1 Thessalonians 4:13-18** - The dead in Christ will rise first\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\n**Continuity and Transformation:**\n- The resurrection body maintains personal identity (it is *our* body raised)\n- Yet it is radically transformed - imperishable, glorious, powerful, spiritual (1 Cor 15:42-44)\n- Christ's resurrection body is the prototype and guarantee\n\n**Physical Reality:**\n- Not mere spiritual immortality or disembodied souls\n- A real, physical (though glorified) body\n- Jesus ate food, could be touched, yet passed through walls (Luke 24, John 20)\n\n## Theological Significance\n\n1. **Affirms Creation's Goodness** - God redeems the material world, not just spirits\n2. **Guarantees Complete Salvation** - The whole person (body and soul) is redeemed\n3. **Grounds Christian Hope** - Death is defeated, not accommodated\n4. **Depends on Christ's Resurrection** - \"If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile\" (1 Cor 15:17)\n\n## Distinction from Other Views\n\nThis differs from:\n- **Greek immortality of the soul** (disembodied existence)\n- **Reincarnation** (return to mortal existence)\n- **Resuscitation** (return to the same mortal body)\n\nThe resurrection is God's supernatural act of new creation for eternal life.",

            "The statement that Jesus 'passed through walls' is not explicit in the canonical gospels; the texts describe Him appearing in rooms with closed doors (Luke 24:31; John 20:19-20). A more precise formulation would be that Jesus appeared despite locked doors, not that He literally passed through walls.",
            "The Old Testament basis is present but the OT does not present a fully developed doctrine of the resurrection; the provided verses point forward to resurrection hope, but the response could acknowledge the more varied OT expectations and the way New Testament teaching develops the doctrine.",
            "The phrase 'all people bodily from the dead for final judgment' is broadly correct in traditional Christian eschatology, but it should be clarified that while the resurrection is universal in scope, the final outcome (eternal life for believers vs. eternal judgment for unbelievers) depends on faith in Christ. The response could more explicitly connect the resurrection to judgment and the final two destinies."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the LLM response accurately articulates the core teaching of bodily resurrection: a future, physical, transformed, glorified body for believers, with continuity of personal identity and an essential link to Christ’s own resurrection as the guarantee. It grounds the doctrine in key New Testament texts (1 Corinthians 15, John 5:28-29, Philippians 3:20-21, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18) and supports it with OT hints (Job 19:25-27; Daniel 12:2; Isaiah 26:19). It also emphasizes the materiality of the resurrection and its theocentric purpose (creation's goodness, full salvation, and Christ’s victory). The main strengths are doctrinal coherence, biblical grounding, and helpful distinctions from other views (soul immortality, reincarnation, resuscitation). The principal area for tightening is precision in the depiction of Jesus’ post-resurrection appearances and a bit more explicit acknowledgment of the intermediate state and the twofold destiny at the final judgment. These adjustments would enhance accuracy without changing the core teaching."

          "explanation": "The response presents a largely orthodox Christian doctrine of the resurrection of the body. It aligns with historic teaching that at the end of history God will redeem the whole person (body and soul) through a bodily, transformed, imperishable resurrection, grounded in Scripture (Old Testament hints and New Testament teaching such as 1 Cor 15, John 5:28-29, Phil 3:21, 1 Thess 4:13-18). It rightly rejects views such as the immortality of the soul apart from the body, reincarnation, and mere resuscitation. It emphasizes physical reality, continuity of personal identity, and transformation into glory, and it notes the resurrection as the basis for final judgment and Christian hope; it also correctly contrasts this with Gnostic/dualistic tendencies that treat the body as inherently evil or only spiritual salvation. \n\nPotential minor nuance to clarify (not heresy):\n- The phrase about Jesus “ate food, could be touched, yet passed through walls” is a common shorthand for a glorified but tangible body capable of transcending ordinary barriers. The biblical data show Jesus appearing to the disciples in a locked room (John 20:19) and inviting Thomas to touch His wounds (John 20:27); some readers read “passing through walls” as a theological shorthand rather than a literal textual claim. Precision here would be helpful.\n- The core definition asserts that God will raise “all people bodily from the dead for final judgment,” which touches on general resurrection. Some biblical interpretations distinguish between the general resurrection (all the dead) and the resurrected order within that framework (e.g., believers first, then others). The response cites “dead in Christ will rise first” (1 Thess 4:13-18), which reflects a believer-focused phase. Clarifying how universal resurrection and the rescue of believers relate would remove potential ambiguity, though it does not constitute heresy.\n\nOverall assessment: the material is sound and orthodox; no heresies detected.}"
