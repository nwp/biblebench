It foregrounds dialogue, pastoral sensitivity, and local autonomy, signaling a preference for nuance over doctrinal rigidity. While it cites scriptural passages to summarize conservative positions and references cultural-contextual readings in progressive ones, it treats both sides as legitimate options and emphasizes transparency and dignity for LGBTQ+ individuals across perspectives. This balanced, non-advocacy framing aligns with a moderate stance rather than a firm endorsement of either side. The closing prompt to classify the text further reinforces self-awareness of its balanced posture rather than a doctrinal assertion. ",
