Orthodox Christianity affirms the unity of God across both Testaments. The same God who created the world, gave the law, and showed justice in the Old Testament is the God who sent Jesus.

          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies Marcionism/Neo-Marcionism as the error of positing two different gods and rightly emphasizes the unity of Scripture, the immutability of God, and the continuity of revelation from OT to NT. It grounds claims in key texts (Hebrews 13:8; Malachi 3:6; Matthew 5:17-18; Luke 16:19-31; Romans 1-3; Revelation) and articulates why the OT wrath is righteous judgment against sin rather than evidence of a different God. A minor doctrinal slip is the use of Luke 16:19-31 to claim Jesus quoted the OT approvingly and explained divine judgment; this passage does not directly support that claim. Overall, the answer aligns with orthodox Christian teaching and captures essential nuances like unity of character and progressive revelation."
