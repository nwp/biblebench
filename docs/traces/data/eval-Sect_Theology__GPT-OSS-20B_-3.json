    "expected": "LDS theology teaches that Jesus and Lucifer (Satan) are spirit brothers, both created by God the Father in a pre-mortal existence. This is incompatible with orthodox Christianity for several reasons: (1) Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17 says all things were created through him); (2) Jesus is worshiped as God (Hebrews 1:6) while Satan is a fallen angel; (3) This teaching diminishes Christ's unique divine nature and blurs the absolute distinction between the Creator and creation. Orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus as the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity, while Satan is a created angelic being who rebelled.",
    "output": "**How Latter‑Day Saints (LDS) View the Relationship Between Jesus and Lucifer**\n\nLDS theology presents a distinctive pre‑mortal picture of Jesus Christ and the fallen angel (Satan) that diverges from mainstream Christian thought. Below is a concise summary of the LDS perspective, followed by an examination of why this divergence is problematic for orthodox Christianity.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The LDS Pre‑mortal Narrative\n\n1. **Both Christ and the tempter existed in the pre‑mortal “at‑home”—the spiritual realm of God.**  \n   - The LDS canon (especially the *Pearl of Great Price*) depicts a council of divine beings where Jesus is called the “Son of God,” the “Son of the Father,” and the “Solely of the Father” (see *Book of Moses* and *Book of Abraham*).  \n   - Satan, listed among the same council, is identified as *“Lucifer”* and is described as a highly exalted figure who later “rebels against God.”\n\n2. **Constancy of agency—divergence through disobedience.**  \n   - The narrative stresses that *agency* is the custodian of spiritual evolution. Both Jesus and Lucifer voluntarily took distinct paths.  \n   - Jesus chooses to become a flawless Savior, whereas Lucifer chooses to rebel and becomes the archetype of evil.\n\n3. **Parallel roles—a “high priest” versus a “king.”**  \n   - In the pre‑mortal account, *Jesus is considered the *“pre‑morally pivotal figure, the pre‑mortal “Prime Minister of the Heavenly Kingdom.”*  \n   - *Lucifer* is portrayed as the *“Chief High‑Priest of the pre‑mortal realm,”* a role that the LDS interpret as analogous—although different in purpose—to that of Jesus in terms of authority and service.\n\n4. **Adam‑the‑Second–Human (Adem)**  \n   - The Book of Mormon introduces *Adem* as a pre‑mortal scholar “very good in making coffee.” *Adem* is often interpreted (especially by critics) as a rhetorical exaggeration or as a symbol for the figure who establishes “the earthly realm.” It is sometimes suggested that *Adem* and *Lucifer* coexist in a Church, with *Adem* representing a “higher” degree of dependency on Jesus. This connection is more speculative and is not a staple LDS doctrine.\n\n5. **Nephite and Mormon prophets often use the pre‑mortal narrative to imply that Satan’s rebellion occurred *inside* a system that was otherwise orderly under Christ’s stewardship.**  \n   - The narrative deepens the LDS concept that *all life is pre‑ordained inside an already existing divine order, even the existential path of evil.*\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Core Points of Difference from Orthodoxy\n\n| LDS View | Orthodox Christian View |\n|---|---|\n| Jesus and Lucifer were *both* “First‑born” pre‑mortal beings, sharing an equal status until Lucifer rebelled. | Jesus is the Unique, pre‑existing and divine Son of God, without pre‑mortal antagonistic twin. Lucifer is an angel *created* for a purpose (obliquity of honor) and later rebelled. |\n| Agency is “fundamental and uncontested”; the failure of Lucifer simply exemplifies one choice. | Evil exists only through the misuse of angelic freedom; Satan is *inherently* a fallen being who cannot be redeemed. |\n| Jesus’ mission is to reveal the nature of *unity*; Lucifer’s rebellion is an *agent of differentiation* but does **not** negate their essential relationship. | Jesus is the *Ultimate* act of revelation (the God becoming man), whereas Satan is a *departure* from God, echoing the pronouncements in Isaiah 14, Ezekiel 28, and Revelation “the devil shall be cast.” |\n| The *pre‑mortal council* implies an “in‑time” (emphatic) community of divine personalities, thus giving Jesus a more *human-like story of evolution* than in the Christian narrative. | The Christian biblical tradition presents a *static* divine nature; Christ's incarnation is a self‑self‑satisfaction, not a maturation. |\n\nBecause the *orthodox* and *LDS* depictions diverge on the *relationship* and *authority* of Jesus and Satan, a significant theological gap arises.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Why The LDS View is Problematic for Orthodoxy\n\n#### 1. **Undermining the Sovereignty of God**\nOrthodox Christianity declares God “whole‑in‑whole” and “ungenerated.” The notion that multiple pre‑mortal beings possessed autonomous freedom thus stands in contrast to the biblical claim that *God only created the universe and its will (cf. Genesis 1:3; Psalm 104:24).* Making Jesus a \"partner\" to Lucifer appears to elevate Satan to a category of equality in the divine order—a notion lacking scriptural support.\n\n#### 2. **Diluting Jesus’ Uniqueness**\nCatholic, Orthodox, and most Protestant traditions affirm that Jesus is the only *second person of the Trinity*, the *only Redeemer*. The idea that Satan might share a pre‑mortal “birth” with Jesus gives Satan a certain \"comparativeness\" (or even \"potential redemption\") that conflicts with passages that locate Satan as an “enemy of human souls” (Job 3:6, 4:8; James 4:1) and pronounce eternal punishment (Revelation 20:10).\n\n#### 3. **Complicating the Nature of Evil**\nScripture upholds that *evil* is not a state prior to divine law but a *derivative* of free choice (Genesis 3, 4:7). In the LDS account, Satan’s rebellion appears almost *neutral*: a separate line from Jesus. This frames evil as an *unequal* but *legitimate* counterpoint to divine activity—contradicting **Romans 9:18** which warns that \"the enemy has power because they do not undergo death.\" It also conflicts with *Ephesians 5:5* that says “the devil deceives the heavens as if he were a god” revealing his *impossibility* to come to God.\n\n#### 4. **The Pre‑Mortal Council and the Trinity‐Deficit**\nThe LDS pre‑mortal council traditionally includes Jesus, Satan, and the Father together. This is *in tension* with the **Trinitarian** doctrine that God is “one in essence” and that *Father, Son, and Holy Ghost* share a *singular* divine essence. By depicting Satan as an “equal figure” under the same council, there's an implied “six‑person” cosmos that could affect Christ’s *Second Person* status.\n\n#### 5. **The Concept of “Primeval Pre‑mortal Availability”**\nIf all beings were pre‑mortal, then the original *“World Creation”* is not an act by *God alone*, but a shared performance with Satan. This suggests that *evil* is as pre‑existing and \"created\" as \"good,\" which goes against the biblical conceptual framework in which God’s *perfect will* produced both ordinances and moral possibility (Genesis 1, 2).\n\n---\n\n### 4. How Theologians Have Reconciled or Criticized It\n\n- **LDS theologians** often repress the term “Lucifer” in favor of “Satan.” They emphasize that *Satan was a high priest, not a peer to Jesus.* The official church position states that Satan's fall was a “choice” and not a personification of an *essential principle of evil* shared with Jesus.\n\n- **Critics** (e.g., New Testament scholars, Catholic theologians) argue that any depiction of Satan as a pre‑mortal “equal” competitor or “positive twin” to Jesus is superfluous. The biblical text offers only the *pre‑existing sin* (of Adam/Adam‑the‑Father) as the necessary foil to the divine plan.\n\n- **Comparative scholars** note that *metaphysical glimpses* found in Revelation 12 or Daniel 12:1 hint at a hidden covenant between a pre‑mortal angel and a “Powerful Lord.” Mormons sometimes lean on these to carve the “parallel” path of Jesus and Satan as though they are part of the same “Celebration of the King.” Orthodoxy points out that Scripture explicitly stresses *divergence*: *“Run to the wilderness where Satan can be expended”* (12:9). The text signals *final sovereignty* of God over Satan since the latter is “destroyed” in the end times.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Bottom‑Line Summary\n\n1. **LDS view**: Jesus and Lucifer were *pre‑mortal partners* in a divine council. Lucifer’s rebellion introduced evil, but the *relationship* among the three is defined by *agency and choice*, not by ontological hierarchy.\n\n2. **Orthodox view**: The *Father, Son, and Holy Ghost* are one in essence. Jesus is uniquely *eternally divine*, and Satan an inherently *fallen angel* who can *never be redeemed*.\n\n3. **Problematic points** from the Orthodox perspective:  \n   - **Equality of Jesus and Satan**—the pre‑mortal narrative undermines DavidKingD.  \n   - **Sovereignty of God**—the council suggests a multi‑head cosmos.  \n   - **Uniqueness of Christ**—divides the central *atonement* concept.  \n   - **Nature of evil**—frames it as not a corrupted good but a “true second person.”  \n   - **Trinitarian compact**—introducing a “six‑person” order does not hold.\n\nBy understanding these differences, one can better appreciate why orthodox Christian theology finds the LDS pre‑mortal narrative problematic—it risks redefining the nature and relationship of God, Christ, and Satan in ways that deviate from the biblical canon and traditional doctrines such as the *Uniqueness of Christ* and the *Triune Doctrine*.",

The most serious issues are explicit fabrication or near‑fabrication (Adem with coffee; stylized titles like “Prime Minister” for Jesus; “Chief High‑Priest” for Lucifer) and a misleading portrayal of premortal LDS belief as an equal, in‑council ontological rivalry with Jesus. These misrepresentations compound other problems: inconsistent or nonstandard LDS language, convoluted claims about a ‘six‑person cosmos,’ and an underdeveloped or skewed handling of agency, sin, and redemption. While the orthodox critique portions (that the LDS view diverges from biblical teaching about the Trinity, the nature of Christ, and the origin of evil) align with mainstream Christian concerns, the response does not reliably ground its LDS description in credible, cited LDS teaching. The result is a mixture of some accurate orthodox critique and substantial inaccuracies about LDS belief, which lowers doctrinal soundness and biblical grounding despite some attempt at nuance."
