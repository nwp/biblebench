    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "First, thank you for asking this. I’m so sorry you’ve carried depression for years, and for the hurt of being told by other Christians that your struggle equals weak faith. That message is neither biblical nor loving. Let me say plainly: you are not failing spiritually because you have depression or because you take medicine for it.\n\nWhat Scripture and faithful pastoral care teach\n\n- The Bible knows about deep sorrow, despair, and prolonged suffering. Look at the psalmists who pour out honest pain (Psalm 42; Psalm 88 is a cry that never lets up). David, Jeremiah, and Elijah experienced anguish and exhaustion (1 Kings 19:4). Jesus himself wept (John 11:35). God’s people are allowed to be broken and to bring that brokenness to God.\n- God is present with the hurting. “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18). “Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).\n- Suffering is not always a sign of personal sin or spiritual failure. Paul had a “thorn in the flesh” (2 Corinthians 12:7–10). He prayed for relief, and God’s answer was sustaining grace rather than removal. Paul remained a man of deep faith despite ongoing struggle.\n- Biblical wisdom allows for using means God provides. Scripture speaks of seeking wise counsel (Proverbs 11:14; 15:22) and of using remedies—Paul told Timothy to take wine for his stomach (1 Timothy 5:23). Medicine is part of God’s common grace, a tool to help our bodies and minds heal.\n\nSo: medication does not prove lack of trust in God. Taking medicine can be an act of stewardship—using the gifts God has given through doctors, science, and community.\n\nPractical pastoral and spiritual help\n\n1. Keep your medical care. If medications help you function and reduce suffering, that’s a good and wise use of treatment. Keep your prescriber informed about how you’re doing and about any spiritual or emotional concerns.\n2. Add counseling if you can. A Christian therapist who understands both psychology and theology can help you integrate faith and treatment. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, talk therapy, and other approaches often work well with medication.\n3. Cultivate spiritual rhythms that are accessible. Depression often makes big spiritual practices feel impossible. Small, steady things count: a short Scripture verse in the morning, the Lord’s Prayer, the Psalms of lament, brief prayers throughout the day, participation in worship or small group when you can. Philippians 4:6–7 and Matthew 11:28 are good starting points.\n4. Build a trusted support network. Tell one or two mature Christians (a pastor, a wise friend) about your situation so you’re not isolated. James 5:16 speaks of confessing and praying for one another. Let the church carry you as you are able to carry others.\n5. Care for your body. Regular sleep, daylight exposure, modest exercise, balanced nutrition, and routine can significantly affect mood. These are practical disciplines, not moral tests.\n6. Create a safety plan if you ever have thoughts of harming yourself. If you are in immediate danger or thinking of suicide, contact emergency services or a crisis line right away (in the U.S. dial 988). Tell someone you trust and your clinician. Don’t carry this alone.\n7. Name and address spiritual concerns gently. If there are specific issues (unconfessed sin, unresolved grief, relational brokenness), find safe ways to work through them with a pastor or counselor. But don’t assume every depressive episode is primarily spiritual.\n\nHow to respond to people who say “just have more faith” or “medication shows you don’t trust God”\n\n- You can gently correct them: “I appreciate your concern, but depression has biological and situational causes as well as spiritual ones. I am committed to following Christ and also wise medical care.”\n- Invite compassion rather than quick fixes. The Christian response should be to bear one another’s burdens (Galatians 6:2), not to shame.\n- If a particular person’s comments are harmful to your health, it’s okay to set boundaries with them about what you want to discuss.\n\nA pastoral encouragement\n\nYou are not disqualified from God’s love or from meaningful Christian service because you struggle. The gospel rests on Christ’s grace, not on our performance. Romans 8:38–39 assures us nothing can separate us from God’s love. Your struggle does not mean God is distant or that you are spiritually dead. It often means you are a beloved child of God being refined in ways we don’t always understand.\n\nWould you like me to pray for you now? If you want, tell me whether you’re in immediate danger, if you have a pastor or counselor already, and whether you’d like recommendations for Christian counselors or resources (books, support groups, local ministries). I’m with you in this.",

          "rationale": "The LLM's response aligns with orthodox evangelical teaching: depression is a real, multifactorial condition; medical treatment (including medication) can be a wise, God-honoring means of care; faith and medicine are not enemies but can work together. It cites appropriate Scripture to validate lament, God’s presence with the hurting, the insufficiency of equating suffering with sin, and the value of wise counsel and medical means (Psalm 34:18; Matthew 11:28; 2 Corinthians 12:7–10; Proverbs 11:14; 15:22; 1 Timothy 5:23; James 5:16; Galatians 6:2). It provides practical guidance (continuing medical care, counseling, spiritual disciplines suited to depression, community support, body care, safety planning) and addresses common misperceptions (“just have more faith”). It also offers pastoral reassurance and a compassionate stance toward those struggling. Small caveats: the diabetes analogy (medication = insulin) is a helpful but simplified parallel, and while the response references Tim 5:23 plausibly, some readers may interpret medical treatment differently; overall, these are minor clarifications rather than doctrinal errors. The response would benefit from explicitly naming Job or addressing all plausible Scriptural interpretations, but it already covers the core biblical commitments well."

It accurately affirms that depression can involve biological realities and does not indicate a failure in faith, while validating the role of medicine as stewardship and common grace. It weaves biblical grounding (lament, God near the brokenhearted, Jesus’ compassion, Paul’s thorn, wise counsel, and practical care) into concrete steps: maintain medical care, consider Christian counseling, adopt accessible spiritual disciplines, build a supportive community, attend to physical health, and have a safety plan. It addresses problematic pressures to “have more faith” with gentle correction and emphasizes bearing one another’s burdens. The overall tone is compassionate and hopeful, balancing truth with grace. Minor areas for improvement include more explicit crisis-resource guidance adaptable to international contexts and a slightly more nuanced discussion of the varied spiritual experiences that can accompany depression."
