        "input": "Should churches prioritize social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Often, yes—but with careful definitions and priorities.\n\n### 1) If “social justice” means biblical justice, it belongs in the church’s life\nScripture repeatedly treats justice and mercy as non-optional fruits of faith, not a political add-on:\n\n- **Micah 6:8**: do justice, love mercy, walk humbly with God.  \n- **Isaiah 1 / Amos 5**: God rejects worship divorced from justice.  \n- **James 2**: partiality and neglect of the poor contradict genuine faith.  \n- **Ephesians 2**: the gospel creates a reconciled people across historic hostilities.  \n- **Acts 2–6**: the early church addressed material need and ethnic tension as part of its common life.\n\nSo if a church never speaks to racial hostility, exploitation, or neglect of the vulnerable, it is likely neglecting major biblical themes.\n\n### 2) But the church should not simply mirror the political categories of its culture\n“Social justice” can be used to mean many things—some compatible with Christian teaching, some not. Churches should prioritize:\n- **Clear biblical grounding** (sin, dignity, reconciliation in Christ, love of neighbor, honesty, impartiality).\n- **Moral clarity without partisan capture** (the church can critique *any* side when it violates human dignity).\n- **The church’s distinct tools**: preaching, sacraments, discipleship, prayer, formation of character, and communal practices of generosity and hospitality.\n\n### 3) “Prioritize” doesn’t mean “replace the gospel” — justice should flow from it\nA healthy framing is: **the gospel is central; justice is integral**.\n- The church’s unique mission is to **proclaim Christ**, make disciples, and form a holy community.\n- That community, if faithful, will **produce visible reconciliation and care for the vulnerable**—not as a substitute for salvation, but as its fruit.\n\nWhen justice becomes detached from worship, repentance, forgiveness, and the cross, it can become moralism or activism without spiritual depth. When “gospel ministry” ignores injustice, it becomes hypocrisy or private spirituality.\n\n### 4) What it can look like in practice (without mission drift)\n**Racial reconciliation**\n- Teach and model that ethnic superiority, contempt, and scapegoating are sins.\n- Practice repentance and repair where needed (e.g., listening, truth-telling, changing unfair internal norms, shared leadership).\n- Build durable relationships across lines of distrust—not just one-off events.\n\n**Economic inequality / poverty**\n- Robust benevolence and mutual aid (not merely “handouts,” but dignifying help).\n- Job support, financial counseling, debt relief structures, partnering with effective local ministries.\n- Disciple members whose economic power affects others (business owners, landlords, managers) toward honesty, fairness, and generosity.\n\n**Note:** Addressing “systems” can be appropriate, but churches should be careful: not every policy question has a single “Christian” answer. The church can insist on principles (dignity, honesty, protection of the vulnerable) while allowing prudential disagreement on policy details.\n\n### 5) A useful rule of thumb\nA church is probably healthy when it can say:\n- We preach Christ crucified and risen.\n- We call people to repentance and faith.\n- We are forming a community where the poor are cared for and ethnic hostility is confronted.\n- We can discuss hard issues truthfully without becoming a political club.\n\nIf you want, tell me your church’s context (size, city/suburb/rural, demographics, denomination/tradition), and I can suggest what “right-sized” prioritization could look like without splitting the congregation or diluting core doctrine.",

It grounds arguments in Scripture, outlines clear normative duties for the church (combatting racial hostility, caring for the poor, pursuing reconciliation), and offers practical applications. While it includes mild hedges about policy disagreements and cautions against reducing justice to activism, these are minor and do not significantly dilute the stance. Overall, it authentically expresses the view with strong, explicit position rather than mere description."
