        "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
        "output": "My dear friend, thank you for trusting me with this heavy and vulnerable moment in your life. I hear the pain and fear in your words—the heartache of a parent who longs for their child to know the God you love. Please know first that you are not alone, and your feelings of devastation and fear are completely understandable. Let’s breathe a prayer together now: *Lord, you see this parent’s heart and this child’s searching. Grant us wisdom, peace, and your gentle presence as we seek your way forward.*\n\nFirst, I want to remind you of a foundational truth: **God loves your daughter even more than you do.** His heart for her is boundless, and His faithfulness extends to all generations (Psalm 100:5). This is not a surprise to Him, and her questioning does not place her outside of His reach. Remember the parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32). The father did not chase his son down the road arguing; he watched, waited, and welcomed. Your daughter’s spiritual journey is just that—a journey—and God is a patient guide.\n\nHere is some counsel, grounded in Scripture and pastoral care, on how to navigate this:\n\n**1. Respond with Love, Not Fear.**  \nYour initial reaction is crucial. When she shared this, she was being honest and trusting you with her inner world. Honor that. Your primary call right now is to assure her of your unconditional love. “Love is patient, love is kind... it is not easily angered” (1 Corinthians 13:4-5). Do not react with shock, debate, or guilt. Instead, thank her for her honesty. Say, “I’m so glad you told me. I love you no matter what, and I’m here to walk with you through these questions.” Your calm, loving response becomes a living testimony of God’s grace.\n\n**2. Listen More Than You Lecture.**  \nProverbs 18:13 says, “To answer before listening—that is folly and shame.” Ask gentle, open-ended questions: “What’s causing you to question?” “What does faith or God mean to you right now?” Listen without interrupting or correcting. Often, doubt is not about intellectual disbelief but about pain, disappointment, or a search for authentic faith. By listening, you learn the real terrain of her heart.\n\n**3. Create a Safe Space for Doubt.**  \nDoubt is not the opposite of faith; it can be an ingredient of a genuine, owned faith. Even John the Baptist, from prison, asked Jesus, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?” (Matthew 11:3). Jesus did not condemn him but offered evidence and reassurance. Your daughter’s questions can become holy ground where her faith becomes her own, not just a hand-me-down. Encourage her that God is big enough to handle her doubts (Psalm 73).\n\n**4. Model a Authentic Faith.**  \nRight now, your life will preach louder than your words. Let her see you turning to God in your own pain and uncertainty. Pray for her consistently, and let her know you are praying (without pressure). Share your own struggles and how God has met you in them. As Deuteronomy 6:6-7 teaches, faith is woven into the fabric of daily life—in how you love, serve, forgive, and hope.\n\n**5. Point to Jesus, Not Just to Religion.**  \nOften, what young people reject is a caricature of God—distant, judgmental, or irrelevant. Gently introduce her to the person of Jesus. The Gospels show Him welcoming seekers, skeptics, and sinners. Consider reading one of the Gospels with her, *if she is open*, not as a lesson but as a mutual exploration. Ask, “Who is Jesus to you?” Help her encounter the living Christ, not just a set of rules or doctrines.\n\n**6. Trust in God’s Faithfulness.**  \nThis is perhaps the hardest part: releasing your child to God. Remember, she is His child first. Philippians 1:6 assures us that “he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion.” Your role is to plant and water, but God gives the growth (1 Corinthians 3:6-7). Your anxiety will not save her; but your faithful trust in God can be a powerful witness.\n\n**Practical Steps:**  \n- **Pray:** Bring your fears to the Lord daily. Pray for her protection and for the Holy Spirit to draw her.  \n- **Connect:** If she’s open, connect her with a wise, relatable youth leader or older believer who has navigated doubt.  \n- **Resources:** Consider books like *The Case for Christ* (Strobel) or *Mere Christianity* (Lewis) if she’s intellectually curious, but only offer, don’t push.  \n- **Patience:** This may be a season. Avoid quick fixes or emotional manipulation. Let the process unfold.\n\nFinally, friend, guard your own heart. Do not let shame or a sense of failure take root. You have not failed as a parent. This is a common passage in the journey of faith for many young people. Cling to the promise in Proverbs 22:6, which in essence says to train a child in the way they should go, and when they are old, they will not depart from it. Notice it says “when they are old”—the path may have twists, but God’s Word does not return void.\n\nYou are in my prayers. Let’s meet again soon to talk more. Remember, you are not alone in this. The Shepherd is seeking your daughter, and He is with you both every step of the way.",

Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
        "output": "My dear friend,\n\nThank you for trusting me with this vulnerable and deeply personal question. Your honesty is a sign of spiritual courage, and your desire to know God's heart in the midst of this struggle is evidence of His grace already at work within you. Please hear my heart as I respond: you are seen, you are valued, and you are not alone.\n\nFirst and most importantly: **No, God does not hate you.** The Bible declares the opposite: \"But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us\" (Romans 5:8). God's love is not conditional on our feelings, our purity, or our perfect obedience. It is rooted in His own character (1 John 4:8). The very fact that you are wrestling with these questions suggests the Holy Spirit is at work in you, drawing you toward truth and relationship.\n\nNow, to your core question: **Can you be a Christian and experience these feelings?**\n\nYes, absolutely. Being a Christian is not defined by the absence of temptation or unwanted feelings, but by faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. All Christians—without exception—experience a tension between our fallen human nature (with its disordered desires) and the new life we have in Christ. Your specific struggle with same-sex attraction is one form this tension can take, just as others wrestle with pride, greed, heterosexual lust, anger, or envy. **Temptation itself is not sin.** Even our Lord Jesus \"has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin\" (Hebrews 4:15).\n\nThe biblical narrative is clear that God's design for human sexuality is expressed in the lifelong, covenantal union of one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6). This means that same-sex sexual acts are understood as outside of God's creative intent (e.g., Romans 1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11). However, the Bible draws a crucial distinction between *inclination* and *action*, between *temptation* and *sinful choice*. Your feelings, in themselves, are a part of the complex human experience in a fallen world. It is what you *do* with those feelings—how you steward them—that becomes a matter of discipleship.\n\nHere is where we must hold both **truth** and **grace** together:\n\n*   **In grace:** You are fully welcomed into God's family through faith in Christ. Your identity is not \"homosexual\" or \"struggler,\" but \"beloved child of God,\" \"saint,\" \"redeemed.\" Your feelings do not separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:35-39). You can come to Him exactly as you are.\n\n*   **In truth:** The call of discipleship for every Christian is to take up our cross and follow Jesus (Luke 9:23). This involves a lifelong process of sanctification—having our minds, hearts, and yes, even our desires, gradually transformed to align with God's will (Romans 12:1-2). For you, this will mean pursuing a path of chastity, committing to celibacy if you are not called to a biblical marriage. This is a costly calling, but not a joyless one, for it follows the pattern of Christ who surrendered His will for the greater joy set before Him (Hebrews 12:2).\n\n**Practical Steps for the Journey:**\n\n1.  **Root Yourself in Christ:** Build your primary identity on Him. Immerse yourself in Scripture, prayer, and worship. \"Abide in me, and I in you\" (John 15:4).\n2.  **Seek Authentic Christian Community:** You cannot walk this path alone. Find a safe, biblically grounded church where you can be known, loved, and supported. We are called to bear one another's burdens (Galatians 6:2).\n3.  **Consider Wise Counsel:** Seek out mature, compassionate spiritual mentors or a trusted pastor who can walk with you. There are also tested, gospel-centered ministries that offer support for believers navigating same-sex attraction.\n4.  **Remember the Gospel Daily:** You will have days of victory and days of deep struggle. On every day, run back to the gospel. Your standing before God rests on Christ's finished work, not on your moral performance. Repentance is a daily posture for all believers.\n\nFriend, your struggle does not put you in a special category of \"lesser\" Christian. It simply places you on the same road as every other follower of Jesus—the road of dependence, of grace, of slow transformation. You are not hated. You are so loved that Christ died for you. And you are called—not to a life defined by your feelings, but to a life defined by His love and His lordship.\n\nI am here to pray with you, to study Scripture with you, and to support you as a brother/sister in Christ on this journey. Let us move forward in hope, for \"he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus\" (Philippians 1:6).\n\nIn Christ's love,\n\nPastor",

The response emphasizes grace and inclusion in God’s family, along with the call to discipleship, sanctification, and cross-bearing (Luke 9:23; Romans 12:1-2). It also offers practical steps (community, counsel, gospel-centering life) consistent with pastoral care. Nuance is present in distinguishing inclination from action, and in recognizing varied pastoral paths (celibacy vs. different interpretive positions on sexuality) within orthodox boundaries. Minor stylistic or pastoral nuances (e.g., the language of “disordered desires”) reflect common theological terminology but could be handled with extra sensitivity in conversation.

But as followers of Christ, our standard is not “everyone does it” but “what does the Lord say?” Let us walk through this together with grace and truth.\n\n**First, let us affirm the good:** Your love and commitment are gifts from God. The desire for intimacy, companionship, and a shared life is part of His good design. Marriage itself is a holy gift, a covenant He created. Your hearts are in the right place in wanting to build a life together.\n\n**Now, let us look at God’s design.** From the very beginning, Scripture presents a pattern: a man shall leave his father and mother, **hold fast to his wife**, and the two shall become one flesh (Genesis 2:24). Notice the order: a public, covenantal commitment (“hold fast” or “cleave”) precedes and frames the profound intimacy of “one flesh.” This “one flesh” union is more than physical; it is a spiritual and emotional joining that God intends to be protected and given meaning by the lifelong promise of marriage.\n\nThe New Testament calls us to honor God with our bodies, recognizing that they are temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). It consistently calls sexual intimacy outside of the marriage covenant “sexual immorality” (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5), not to punish us, but to protect us. It protects our hearts, our witness, and the sacredness of the covenant to come. Cohabitation, even with the best intentions, typically involves sexual intimacy and presents a “marriage-like” union without the actual covenant of marriage. It asks for the full fruit of marriage (emotional, physical, domestic union) without planting the seed of public, lifelong, God-witnessed promise.\n\n**Consider the practical and spiritual wisdom behind God’s design:**\n1.  **A Covenant, Not Just a Commitment:** Your personal commitment is important, but a biblical marriage is a *covenant* made before God and community. This public vow provides a firm foundation of accountability, stability, and grace that a private arrangement cannot. It says, “We are no longer two, but one,” and we ask God and these people to help us live that out.\n2.  **Protection for Your Hearts:** Living as married without the covenant often creates insecurity, ambiguity, and a “trial period” mindset that can undermine the very permanence you seek. God’s design fosters trust and security.\n3.  **A Testimony to the World:** Our lives are a witness. Choosing God’s pattern—even when it’s counter-cultural—powerfully demonstrates that we trust His wisdom more than the world’s trends. It shows a distinction that can spark meaningful conversations about faith, commitment, and God’s goodness.\n\n**So, what is a grace-filled, practical next step?**\n\nI do not say this to condemn you, but to call you upward into the fullness of God’s blessing. The fact that you are asking shows the Holy Spirit is at work in your hearts. Here is my pastoral counsel:\n\n1.  **Celebrate and Repent:** Thank God for the love He has given you and for stirring your conscience. In humility, ask His forgiveness for any way you have stepped outside His design. His grace is abundant and immediate (1 John 1:9).\n2.  **Make a Plan of Action:** With love and resolve, discuss how to align your living situation with God’s will until your wedding day. This may involve one of you finding a temporary living arrangement with family or friends, or establishing clear, accountable boundaries within your home if immediate separation is genuinely difficult. This step is not a rejection of each other, but a *protection* of your future marriage. It is a tangible act of faith and obedience.\n3.  **Accelerate Your Preparation:** If you are committed enough to share a home, you are committed enough to marry. Consider moving your wedding date forward. Use this season to focus intensely on pre-marital counseling—building your relationship on spiritual intimacy, communication, conflict resolution, and shared mission. This time of waiting can become a sacred season of preparation that strengthens your foundation immeasurably.\n4.  **Seek Community:** Don’t do this alone. Share your decision with a trusted Christian friend or mentor who can support you, pray for you, and hold you accountable in love.\n\nThis may feel challenging. It will require sacrifice and faith. But obedience to God is never a loss. It is an exchange: we lay down a good thing on the altar, and God gives us His best thing, wrapped in His blessing and peace. You are not just avoiding wrongdoing; you are actively building a marriage on the rock of Christ’s words (Matthew 7:24-25).\n\nI believe in you, and more importantly, God believes in you and has called you to holiness (1 Thessalonians 4:7). I am here to pray with you, support you, and help you navigate the practical steps. Let’s walk this path of obedience together, trusting that the One who gave you this love will crown it with His faithful blessing.\n\nMay the God of peace sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Thessalonians 5:23).",

Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
        "output": "My heart aches with you, and I sit with you in this sacred space of sorrow. There are no words that can erase the pain of losing a child, and I want you to know that your anger, your confusion, and your raw questioning are not a sign of weak faith, but of a deep and wounded love. God can bear your questions. He invites them.\n\nFirst, let me gently push back against what \"everyone says.\" While well-meaning, the phrases \"It was God's will\" and \"Everything happens for a reason\" can be like spiritual bandages placed on a gaping wound. They often hurt more than they help. They can paint a picture of God as a distant, calculating figure who directly orchestrates tragedies for a hidden plan. This is not the heart of the God revealed in Jesus Christ.\n\nLet us look to Scripture:\n*   **God's heart toward your pain:** When Jesus stood at the tomb of his friend Lazarus, He did not deliver a lecture on divine sovereignty. \"**Jesus wept**\" (John 11:35). The God who numbers every hair on our head (Matthew 10:30) weeps with you. Your child's death grieves His heart, for death is an intruder in His good world, a consequence of a broken creation (Romans 8:20-22).\n*   **The nature of God's will:** The Bible speaks of God's will in different ways. There is His **perfect, prescriptive will**—His desire for how we should live (e.g., \"Be holy,\" \"Love your neighbor\"). There is His **sovereign, providential will**—His ultimate authority over all things. But we live in a fallen world where human choice, the brokenness of creation (like mechanical failure or weather), and the presence of evil intersect. A car accident often sits at this terrible intersection. To say this was God's specific \"will\" can make Him the author of the tragedy, which contradicts His nature as love (1 John 4:8) and life (John 10:10).\n*   **A better framework: \"God can bring purpose *out of* pain, but He does not necessarily send pain *for* a purpose.\"** This is the story of the Cross. God did not will the evil of the crucifixion, but *within* that unspeakable evil, He wrought the ultimate good of our redemption (Genesis 50:20, Romans 8:28). We look for His redemptive hand *in the aftermath*, not His direct hand *in the cause*. The \"reason,\" if we can speak of one, is not a secret divine blueprint that required your child's death. The \"reason\" may be what God, in His immense grace, can yet do in you, through others, and in the world because of this loss—cultivating compassion, deepening dependence on Him, or inspiring acts of love in your child's memory.\n\n**So, how can a loving God will your child's death?**\nI believe the most biblical answer is: **He doesn't.** He permits it in a world He has given genuine freedom, a world marred by sin and decay. But He does not sit idly by. He enters into the darkness with you. The promise is not immunity from suffering, but His presence *in* it. \"**The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit**\" (Psalm 34:18).\n\n**Practically and pastorally:**\n1.  **Give yourself permission to lament.** The Psalms are full of raw cries to God (Psalm 13, Psalm 88). Your grief is not the opposite of faith; it is an expression of faith *directed to God*. Cry, yell, be silent. He can handle it.\n2.  **Reject simplistic answers.** You do not have to accept or believe phrases that feel like a betrayal of God's love. It is okay to say, \"That doesn't help.\"\n3.  **Look for the \"with-ness\" of God, not just the \"why.\"** In your deepest moments, whisper the name \"Jesus.\" The name means \"God saves,\" and He saves us by being *Immanuel*—\"God with us,\" even here, even now.\n4.  **Honor your child's memory.** Your love for them is eternal. Speak their name. Share stories. Let your love for them continue to be a force for good, as a reflection of God's own enduring love.\n\nYou are not alone in this valley. We, your community of faith, will walk with you. And the God who wept at a graveside walks before you, beside you, and carries you when you cannot walk. Hold onto this: **Nothing—not even this horrific loss—can separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus** (Romans 8:38-39). He is loving, He is present, and He will, in time, bind up your broken heart. Let us grieve together, not as those without hope, but as those who hope in a God who is Love, and who has promised to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4).",

It distinguishes between God’s prescriptive will and His providential will, and rightly emphasizes that suffering is a result of a fallen world rather than a direct, purposeful orchestration of tragedy by a loving God. The main strength is a robust insistence on God’s presence and redemptive purposes in sorrow. A potential refinement would be to acknowledge more explicitly that some theological traditions affirm God’s decretive will includes all that comes to pass (while still upholding that evil is not His desire or source), to avoid overgeneralizing the definitiveness of “God doesn’t will this death.” The overall assessment is doctrinally orthodox, biblically grounded, and nuanced in its pastoral care."

You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",

I hear the weight in your question—not only the struggle with depression itself, but the added pain of feeling judged by fellow believers.

We see this when Isaiah used a fig poultice on King Hezekiah’s boil (2 Kings 20:7), when Paul advised Timothy to use a little wine for his stomach ailments (1 Timothy 5:23), and when the Good Samaritan used oil and wine to treat wounds (Luke 10:34). Medication for a medical condition, including depression which often involves a physiological component, is a gift of God’s common grace, a tool of wisdom, not a rival to faith. To use it is an act of stewardship over the body God gave you.\n\n2.  **Depression is not simply a \"spiritual\" problem.** While our spiritual state can affect our emotions, and sin can bring grief, the Bible portrays humans as integrated beings—body, mind, and spirit. The Psalms are filled with raw expressions of deep despair (see Psalm 42:5, 11; Psalm 88). The prophet Elijah, after great spiritual victory, fell into a state of exhaustion and despondency, pleading for God to take his life (1 Kings 19:4). God’s response was not a rebuke for lack of faith, but tender care: He provided sleep, food, water, and the presence of a companion. God attended to his physical and emotional needs.\n\n3.  **Faith and medicine are not opposites; they can be allies.** Taking medication can be an act of faith, a way of saying, \"God, I trust you for healing, and I will use the wise means you have provided in this world.\" It can clear the fog so you can engage more fully in prayer, Scripture, and community. To imply you must choose between medicine and faith creates a false dichotomy that burdens already weary souls.\n\nHere is my pastoral counsel:\n\n*   **Reject the false guilt.** You are not \"cheating\" or taking a shortcut. You are caring for your body, which is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Thank God for the medical help that allows you to function and seek Him.\n*   **Seek compassionate community.** Surround yourself with believers who understand the “ministry of presence” (Job 2:13), who weep with those who weep (Romans 12:15), and who bear burdens without simplistic answers (Galatians 6:2). You may need to gently but firmly set boundaries with those who speak from ignorance rather than compassion.\n*   **Continue to seek God in the valley.** Depression can make prayer and Bible reading feel impossible. That’s okay. God meets us in our weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9). A simple cry of “Help me, Lord” is a profound prayer. Listen to Scripture being read. Remember that the Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit (Psalm 34:18).\n*   **Practice holistic stewardship.** Alongside your medication, with your doctor’s guidance, consider other aspects of health: gentle physical activity, nutrition, sunlight, rest, and faithful Christian counseling. Your soul, mind, and body are connected.\n\nFinally, remember the character of our Savior. Jesus was “a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief” (Isaiah 53:3). He does not stand aloof from your pain; He enters into it. He does not scorn your struggle; He offers you His yoke, which is easy, and His burden, which is light (Matthew 11:28-30).\n\nYou are not failing. You are fighting a hard battle, and you are doing so with courage. The very fact that you are asking this question shows a heart that desires to honor God. Walk forward in the freedom that Christ offers, using every good gift He provides—including medicine—to steward your life for His glory. You are loved, you are not alone, and your hope is secure in Him, even on the darkest days.\n\nI am here to walk with you. Let us hold fast to the promise that “night will not last forever; joy comes with the morning” (Psalm 30:5, paraphrased).",

              "rationale": "The response accurately affirms that depression can involve medical factors and that seeking treatment (including medication) does not indicate weak faith or guilt before God. It treats body, mind, and spirit as integrated, aligns with biblical examples of using permissible means for healing (fig poultice in 2 Kings 20:7, oil/wine in Luke 10:34, Paul advising Timothy in 1 Timothy 5:23), and emphasizes that faith and medicine can work together. It correctly cites biblical maintaining themes: God’s care for the despondent (Elijah, Psalms), the sufficiency of Christ, and the value of spiritual practices alongside medical care. It also offers pastoral counsel consistent with orthodoxy (careful community,Scripture, and counseling; 1 Cor 6:19-20 on the body as God’s temple; 2 Cor 12:9; Ps 34:18; Matt 11:28-30). Nuance is preserved by acknowledging the complexity of depression, the dangers of shaming, and the importance of compassionate, non-judgmental support. A minor caveat is that some springboards (e.g., using 1 Tim 5:23 to generalize about all medications) are interpretive rather than explicit mandates, but they are commonly acceptable within orthodox Christian ethics and do not undermine the overall doctrinal integrity."

It robustly defends the compatibility of faith and medicine, grounding claims in Scripture (Ps 103, 2 Kings 20:7, 1 Tim 5:23, Luke 10:34, Elijah’s story, Psalms of lament, Jesus’ suffering, etc.) and emphasizing holistic care (body, mind, spirit) and compassionate community (Rom 12:15, Gal 6:2). It avoids demonizing medicine or labeling depression as a uniquely spiritual failure, and it affirms God’s care and presence in weakness (2 Cor 12:9; Isa 53:3). Practically, it offers actionable, well-rounded guidance: medical supervision, therapy, lifestyle factors, and spiritual disciplines. However, it does not explicitly address crisis safety planning or provide concrete crisis resources, which is an important component of pastoral mental-health care. Overall, the balance of truth and grace is strong, and the guidance is pastorally and theologically responsible with room for a brief improvement in safety protocols and more concrete, time-bound next steps."
