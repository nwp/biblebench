    "expected": "",
    "output": "## 1) The Bible’s basic pattern: sex belongs to the marriage covenant\n\nAcross Scripture, the “default” moral vision is that sexual union is intended for the covenant of marriage—an exclusive, public, lifelong commitment.\n\n- **Genesis 2:24** ties sexual union (“one flesh”) to a covenantal leaving-and-cleaving: “a man… clings to his wife, and they become one flesh.”  \n- Jesus reaffirms this creation pattern when teaching about marriage (see **Matthew 19:4–6**), treating marriage as a binding covenant rather than a merely private arrangement.\n- Scripture consistently treats sex as more than a physical act—it is profoundly unitive (“one flesh”), with moral and relational weight.\n\n## 2) Clear New Testament prohibitions of sex outside marriage\n\nThe New Testament repeatedly tells Christians to avoid sexual activity outside the bounds of marriage, typically using the term **porneia** (often translated “sexual immorality”).\n\nKey texts include:\n\n- **1 Thessalonians 4:3–8**: “This is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality (porneia)… that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter.”\n- **1 Corinthians 6:18–20**: “Flee from sexual immorality… your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit.”\n- **1 Corinthians 7:2**: “Because of sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.” Paul’s pastoral counsel assumes sex is rightly expressed within marriage.\n- **Hebrews 13:4**: “Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.”\n\nIn the historic Christian reading, these texts rule out **premarital sex** (and other sexual practices outside marriage), not only adultery.\n\n### What does *porneia* mean?\nScholars debate its exact range, but in Jewish and early Christian moral teaching it broadly covered sexual behavior outside a legitimate marriage (e.g., prostitution, adultery, incest, and generally illicit sex). That’s why most churches have understood these passages as excluding premarital intercourse.\n\n## 3) What about cohabitation?\n\n### The Bible doesn’t address modern cohabitation directly…\nThe biblical world didn’t have “cohabitation” as it exists today (a socially recognized non-marital domestic partnership). So there is no verse that says, “Thou shalt not live together before marriage.”\n\n### …but biblical principles raise serious concerns\nMost Christian traditions argue that cohabitation is *at least* spiritually unwise and often morally compromising for several reasons:\n\n1. **It commonly functions as a “marriage-like” union without the covenant.**  \n   Sex and shared life are treated as if the couple were married, while withholding the public, binding commitment Scripture associates with “one flesh” (Genesis 2:24).\n\n2. **It increases temptation and normalizes premarital sex.**  \n   Since the Bible repeatedly calls believers to sexual self-control and holiness (1 Thess. 4), many pastors caution that cohabitation tends to undermine that aim.\n\n3. **It can create confusion or scandal within the Christian community.**  \n   The New Testament often urges believers to live in ways that are “above reproach” and that honorably witness to others (cf. principles in **Romans 14**; **1 Peter 2:12**), even where a situation isn’t explicitly named.\n\nThat said, some couples cohabit for economic, immigration, safety, or caregiving reasons. Pastoral counsel often distinguishes between **sharing housing** and **living as a sexual/domestic union**, but still encourages wisdom, accountability, and clear boundaries.\n\n## 4) Differences among Christian perspectives\n\n### Historic and majority view (Catholic, Orthodox, most Evangelical and traditional Protestant)\n- **Premarital sex is not acceptable** for Christians.  \n- **Cohabitation is strongly discouraged**, especially when it includes sexual activity or presents as a marital union without vows.\n\nThis view appeals to the consistency of biblical sexual ethics, the church’s historic teaching, and the meaning of sex as covenantal “one flesh.”\n\n### More progressive/affirming approaches (some mainline Protestant thinkers and communities)\nSome argue that the Bible’s condemnations target exploitative or idolatrous sex (e.g., prostitution, adultery, coercion), and that a faithful, committed premarital relationship might not fall under *porneia* in the same way. They emphasize:\n- mutual consent,\n- fidelity,\n- love and responsibility,\n- and the complexity of modern marriage patterns.\n\nEven within these circles, many still affirm that casual sex is contrary to Christian discipleship and that commitment and care for the vulnerable are moral non-negotiables.\n\n## 5) A pastoral word: the Christian message includes both holiness and grace\n\nThe Bible’s sexual ethic is demanding, but it is not meant to be merely restrictive; it’s aimed at love, fidelity, and honoring persons as whole people—not consumable experiences.\n\nAt the same time, Christianity is clear that failure is not the end:\n- **1 Corinthians 6:9–11** acknowledges past sexual sin in the church and then says, “*such were some of you… but you were washed*.”\n- Jesus repeatedly meets sexual sinners with both mercy and a call to change (e.g., **John 8:11**: “neither do I condemn you… go, and sin no more,” noting the passage’s textual history, but it reflects a consistent gospel theme).\n\n## Bottom line\n- **The dominant biblical and historic Christian teaching is that sex is for marriage**, and therefore **premarital sexual activity is not acceptable for Christians**.  \n- **Cohabitation is not directly addressed** in Scripture, but most churches conclude it is **spiritually unwise and often inconsistent with Christian sexual ethics**, especially when it includes sexual relations or mimics marriage without vows.\n\nIf you want, I can also address practical questions Christians often wrestle with here (e.g., “What counts as sex?”, engagement/betrothal, living together for financial reasons, or how churches counsel couples toward marriage and chastity).",

However, even when fairly presenting alternatives, the overall tone remains prescriptive and confident in the conservative reading, indicating a primarily dogmatic stance despite pastoral qualifiers."
