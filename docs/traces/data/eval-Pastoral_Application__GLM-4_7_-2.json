    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "Thank you for coming to me with this. I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to ask the hard questions. It tells me that you care about honoring God, even when the path feels unclear or counter-cultural.\n\nI know that this topic feels heavy. You love each other, you are committed, and culturally speaking, you are doing exactly what everyone else does. It can feel confusing when the church says one thing and the world says another. I want to help you navigate this not just with a list of rules, but by looking at the heart of God, the design of marriage, and what is best for your future together.\n\nHere is how I would counsel you from Scripture, with both truth and grace.\n\n### 1. The \"Everyone is Doing It\" Argument\nYou mentioned that \"everyone does it now.\" As a pastor, I can confirm that you are right—statistics show that a majority of couples live together before marriage today. However, Scripture warns us against measuring our lives by the shifting standards of the culture.\n\nIn **Romans 12:2**, Paul writes, *\"Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.\"*\n\nFollowing Jesus has often meant swimming upstream. If we make decisions based on what is \"normal\" rather than what is \"holy,\" we miss the blessing of walking in obedience. The question isn't \"is it popular?\", the question is \"does it align with the design of the One who created us?\"\n\n### 2. The Nature of Commitment vs. Covenant\nYou said, \"We are committed to each other.\" That is a wonderful and necessary starting point. But in the Bible, there is a crucial difference between private commitment and public covenant.\n\nMarriage in Scripture is not just a feeling or a private promise; it is a binding covenant witnessed by God and the community. In **Ephesians 5:31-32**, Paul quotes Genesis: *\"Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.\"* He then calls this a \"profound mystery\" that refers to Christ and the Church.\n\nLiving together tries to enjoy the privileges of the \"one flesh\" union without the binding protection of the covenant. Why is this dangerous? Because a covenant is what makes love safe. When you live together without marriage, you are essentially saying, \"I am committed to you... for now.\" There is always a back door. Biblical marriage shuts the back door so that you can focus entirely on loving one another without fear. Without that covenant, you are building a house on sand rather than rock (Matthew 7:24-27).\n\n### 3. The Biblical Standard for Sexual Intimacy\nThe Bible is clear that sexual intimacy is a gift reserved for the marriage covenant. **Hebrews 13:4** says, *\"Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled.\"*\n\nGod did not design sexual boundaries to be a killjoy; He designed them to protect the intimacy of your future marriage. When you live together, the line between dating and marriage blurs. You lose the unique anticipation of the wedding night, and you rob the future \"you\" of the joy of giving that exclusive gift to your spouse on that day.\n\n**1 Corinthians 6:18-20** reminds us that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit. This means we are not free to do whatever we want with them; we are stewards of God's creation. This is a high calling, not a burden.\n\n### 4. The Appearance of Evil and Your Witness\nFinally, we have to consider how your lifestyle impacts others and your testimony for Christ. **1 Thessalonians 5:22** instructs us to *\"Abstain from every form of evil.\"*\n\nEven if you believe you have not crossed a sexual line, living together creates an unavoidable appearance of sin to the outside world. It confuses younger believers and weakens your witness to non-Christians. If we say we follow Jesus, our lives should make His beauty clear, not confusing. By living separately, you demonstrate to the world that God’s standards are more important to you than your convenience or rent money.\n\n### Practical Steps Forward\nI know this isn't easy to hear, and I don't want to leave you feeling condemned. God loves you deeply, and His grace is sufficient for you right now (Romans 8:1). So, what should you do?\n\n1.  **Prayer and Discussion:** Go to the Lord together. Ask Him, \"Do we love You enough to change our living situation to please You?\"\n2.  **Make a Change (Plan A or Plan B):**\n    *   **Plan A (Marriage):** If you are truly committed and ready to spend your lives together, why wait? If you are financially ready to live together, you are likely ready to marry. Consider accelerating the wedding date and make the covenant public.\n    *   **Plan B (Purity):** If you are not ready for marriage, then biblically, you are not ready to live as a married couple. This means one of you needs to move out. It may seem inconvenient or expensive, but you are investing in the spiritual health and longevity of your future marriage.\n3.  **Seek Accountability:** I urge you to invite a mentor or an older couple into your life to hold you accountable for your purity and your relationship timeline.\n\nI am for you. I want your marriage to be thriving, God-honoring, and built on a foundation that will not shake. Making this change might be the hardest thing you do, but I promise you, looking back, you will see it as an act of worship that protected your relationship.\n\nLet’s pray about this together.",

It correctly cites key passages (Hebrews 13:4; 1 Corinthians 6:18-20; Romans 12:2; Ephesians 5:31-32; Genesis 2:24; 1 Thessalonians 5:22) and interprets marriage as a God-ordained covenant rather than mere private commitment. It treats sex as reserved for marriage, emphasizes the protective purpose of the covenant, and acknowledges the potential impact on witness and culture. The pastoral approach is balanced, offering grace (Romans 8:1) while urging practical steps (pursue marriage or live apart if not ready). Nuance is present in distinguishing covenantal assurance from casual commitment and in addressing public testimony. A minor potential enhancement would be to acknowledge variations in pastoral practice or inner-couple tensions in more detail, but nothing in the response is doctrinally or biblically erroneous. "
