    "input": "Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science, wrote 'Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,' which Christian Scientists study alongside the Bible as authoritative revelation. What's the orthodox Christian perspective on this?",
    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity rejects placing any human writing on par with Scripture's unique divine authority. While commentaries, theological works, and devotional writings can be helpful, the Bible alone is the inspired, inerrant Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16-17). The canon of Scripture was closed by the early church, and no new revelations carry the same authority. Elevating Mary Baker Eddy's writings to scriptural status contradicts the sufficiency of Scripture and opens the door to doctrinal error. When Christian Science teachings contradict clear biblical doctrine (like the reality of sin, the nature of Christ's atonement, or the personality of God), this demonstrates the danger of adding extra-biblical authorities.",
    "output": "From an orthodox Christian standpoint (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and mainstream Protestant), treating **Mary Baker Eddy’s *Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures*** as **authoritative revelation alongside the Bible** is a serious departure from historic Christian teaching—both on **where doctrinal authority comes from** and on **what the Bible is understood to teach**.\n\n## 1) Authority: Scripture, canon, and “co-authoritative” texts\n\n### What Christian Scientists do\nChristian Science congregations often speak of the Bible and *Science and Health* together as their “pastor,” and *Science and Health* functions as a normative interpretive “key” for reading Scripture. In practice, the book is not merely a commentary; it is treated as uniquely authoritative for doctrine.\n\n### How orthodox Christianity evaluates that\nOrthodox Christianity holds that **public revelation** given through the prophets and apostles is **complete** and normatively preserved in:\n\n- **Sacred Scripture** (the canonical Bible), and\n- **Apostolic Tradition** (in Catholic/Orthodox understanding), safeguarded in the Church’s worship, creeds, councils, and teaching office.\n\nEven where Christians disagree about the precise relationship of Scripture and Tradition (e.g., Protestant *sola Scriptura* vs. Catholic/Orthodox Scripture-and-Tradition), **they agree on this**: the Church does not receive new books as universally binding revelation in the way Scripture is. The **canon is “closed”** in the sense that no later writing is granted the same inspired, foundational status as Scripture.\n\nSo an orthodox Christian critique would be:\n\n- If *Science and Health* is treated as **co-equal** with the Bible (or as the indispensable “key” without which Scripture cannot be rightly understood), that conflicts with the historic Christian conviction that the apostolic faith is the normative measure for doctrine.\n- Christian churches may value catechisms, confessions, theological classics, and devotional guides—but these are **subordinate** authorities, always judged by Scripture (and, in Catholic/Orthodox thought, by Scripture as read within the apostolic Tradition).\n\n## 2) Content: why orthodox Christians also object theologically\nBeyond the question of authority, orthodox Christians generally see Eddy’s theology as **redefining core Christian claims** rather than developing them within the bounds of the historic creeds.\n\nWhile Christian Science uses biblical language, orthodox theology typically judges that *Science and Health* departs from creedal Christianity on points such as:\n\n- **God**: Christian Science often describes God in impersonal terms (e.g., “Mind,” “Principle”), whereas orthodox Christianity confesses the living, personal God who creates and acts in history.\n- **Creation and matter**: Christian Science is known for denying the ultimate reality of matter and treating evil/sickness as forms of error or illusion; orthodox Christianity affirms the **goodness and reality of creation** (though fallen) and sees evil as real (even if parasitic rather than a “substance”).\n- **Sin and salvation**: Orthodox Christianity teaches humanity’s real alienation from God through sin and salvation through God’s reconciling action; Christian Science tends to interpret sin and suffering primarily in terms of mistaken belief needing correction.\n- **Jesus Christ**: Classical Christianity confesses Jesus as **fully God and fully man** (Nicene/Chalcedonian doctrine). Christian Science often distinguishes between “Jesus” and “the Christ” in ways orthodox Christians consider incompatible with the Incarnation as historically confessed.\n- **Atonement and resurrection**: Orthodoxy centers salvation on Christ’s atoning death and bodily resurrection; Christian Science typically reinterprets these in non-literal or metaphysical categories, which orthodox Christians see as a denial of the gospel’s historical core (cf. 1 Corinthians 15).\n\nBecause these are not peripheral issues, most orthodox Christians conclude that elevating *Science and Health* is not simply adding a helpful devotional text—it represents a **different doctrinal framework** that revises foundational Christian teachings.\n\n## 3) A fair point of agreement (with an important caveat)\nOrthodox Christians can still acknowledge that Eddy and Christian Scientists often emphasize:\n- earnest Bible reading,\n- prayer,\n- moral seriousness,\n- concern for healing and compassion.\n\nHowever, orthodox theology would insist that Christian prayer for healing and spiritual renewal must remain grounded in the apostolic confession of God, creation, sin, Christ’s incarnation/atonement/resurrection, and the Church’s received faith—rather than in a later “key” that reshapes those doctrines.\n\n## Bottom line\nOrthodox Christianity does not accept *Science and Health* as authoritative revelation alongside the Bible. Even traditions that honor church tradition and authoritative teaching do not place a modern text in the category of inspired, canonical Scripture; and in this case, orthodox Christians also judge the book’s theological reinterpretations to be incompatible with the historic creeds and the mainstream Christian reading of Scripture.\n\nIf you want, I can summarize how **Catholic**, **Eastern Orthodox**, and **Reformed/Evangelical** perspectives would each articulate this in their own technical terms (since they frame authority a bit differently).",
