    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity affirms the bodily, physical resurrection of Jesus as essential to the faith (1 Corinthians 15:14). Jesus appeared in a physical body that could be touched (Luke 24:39, John 20:27), ate food (Luke 24:42-43), and still bore the crucifixion wounds. The empty tomb accounts confirm the body was gone because Jesus was raised, not that it was discarded. Jesus explicitly denied being merely a spirit: 'a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have' (Luke 24:39). The physical resurrection guarantees believers' future bodily resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:20-23) and validates Jesus' victory over death. Denying the physical resurrection undermines the gospel.",

            "The JW section could be more precise: Jehovah's Witnesses generally teach that Jesus did not rise in a physical body but as a heavenly, glorified spirit creature (often identified with Michael the Archangel). The line about Jesus' body being “disposed of” or dissolved into gases is not a standard, uniformly stated JW position in official literature; descriptions vary and are not canonical JW doctrine. The overall phrasing as if there is a single uniform JW doctrine risks oversimplifying or misrepresenting a more nuanced spectrum within JW teaching.",
            "The statement that post-resurrection appearances involved Jesus “temporarily materializing bodies” can oversimplify the orthodox view of the resurrected body. Classical orthodoxy teaches a real, tangible, glorified body (not merely a temporary materialization) that is recognizably the same person with transformed properties, and skeptic/apparition language should be avoided for precision.",
            "The assertion of universal agreement across “Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant” churches on the physical, bodily resurrection, while broadly true, glosses over interpretive differences in how the resurrection is described (e.g., what “glorified body” entails) and the varying emphases in some modern liberal or non-traditional Protestant theologies."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately presents the core orthodox position: Jesus rose bodily in a real, physical form, with scriptural support (Luke 24:39; Luke 24:42-43; John 20:27; 1 Cor 15:20-23). It correctly notes that the resurrected body is transformed/glorified and that the empty tomb confirms bodily resurrection. It also correctly identifies the JW position as divergent from historic orthodoxy. The main value judgment (that this is a significant departure) is fair but could be nuanced by noting the diversity within Protestant thought and the variety within JW teaching. The main refinements needed are greater precision about JW doctrine (which emphasizes Jesus as a spirit creature, not a physical resurrection of the body) and careful wording around the nature of post-resurrection appearances and the universality of the church’s stance across traditions. Overall, the core theological assertions are sound and well-grounded in Scripture, with room for more precise characterization of the JW position and subtlety in orthodox nuances."
