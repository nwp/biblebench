          "rationale": "The answer accurately identifies the Sermon on the Mount’s immediate audience as Jesus’s disciples, with crowds present, citing Matthew 5:1–2. It also correctly references Luke 6:17–49 as a parallel that includes a large crowd and Jesus’s disciples. The response adds the broader significance by noting Matthew’s likely Jewish Christian audience and the sermon’s universal ethical themes, which aligns with common scholarly views. It acknowledges multiple audience levels (immediate/disciples, broader Matthew community, and future readers) and cites Luke as a parallel, all of which reflects standard historical-contextual analysis. Overall, it answers the question directly while providing appropriate nuance about audience layers and scholarly framing. No factual errors or serious omissions detected."
