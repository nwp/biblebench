            "The statement that the Sermon on the Mount directly 'addresses' the crowds is nuanced; the passage in Matthew 5:1-2 presents the disciples as the immediate addressees with crowds listening, so describing the crowds as the primary audience would be inaccurate. The answer could have more clearly separated 'immediate audience' (the disciples) from 'audience present' (the crowd).",
            "The Luke 6:17-49 comparison is broadly accurate but the description that Luke's version 'differs significantly' in audience emphasis could be read as overstating the divergence; Luke presents a similar teaching to a large crowd with the disciples present, rather than a wholly separate teaching occasion."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the Sermon on the Mount as directed primarily to Jesus' disciples, with crowds present, and notes Luke's parallel in a mixed-audience setting. It also accurately frames Matthew's use of the sermon as foundational for the community and acknowledges scholarly debate about redaction/reshaping. The main potential misstep is a slightly rigid claim about the 'primary audience' vs the audience present, and a minor nuance about Luke's differences; these are subtle interpretive shifts rather than factual errors. Overall, the answer is factually solid, complete for the question, and appropriately nuanced."
