          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies the audience as Jesus’ disciples and the crowd who followed him. The Beatitudes Sermon is indeed set in Galilee, and the Gospel accounts describe Jesus teaching the disciples after the crowds are present, so the addition 'in Galilee' is geographically accurate and does not alter the core point. This aligns with common exegesis that while the primary recipients were the disciples, the broader crowd also heard the teaching. The statement is biblically grounded and theologically orthodox. A minor nuance is the ongoing scholarly discussion about the distinction between the 'primary audience' (the disciples) and the broader audience (the crowds); however, the LLM’s wording remains faithful to scripture and standard Christian interpretation."
