    "expected": "This teaching conflicts with the orthodox Christian doctrine of salvation by grace through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28). While orthodox Christianity acknowledges that genuine faith produces good works and obedience (James 2:17), it teaches that salvation is received as a free gift through faith in Christ's finished work, not earned through human effort or religious rituals. The LDS concept of exaltation through temple ordinances (endowment, celestial marriage, etc.) adds requirements beyond what Scripture teaches and represents a works-based salvation system that contradicts the biblical gospel of grace.",

The historic Christian position, affirmed across Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions (despite their differences), is that salvation cannot be earned or achieved through human effort, ordinances, or institutional requirements.\n\nThe Apostle Paul warned strongly against adding requirements to the gospel (Galatians 1:6-9). While Latter-day Saints sincerely believe they are following Christ, orthodox Christianity would view this teaching as a \"different gospel\" that inadvertently undermines the sufficiency of Christ's finished work.\n\n**This assessment is made respectfully**, recognizing the sincere faith of LDS members, while honestly addressing the theological incompatibility with historic biblical Christianity.",

The statement “no specific institutional authority required for valid baptism” is not universally accurate across historic Christianity."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately portrays the orthodox claim of salvation by grace through faith, with good works as the fruit of faith, and it correctly identifies the LDS emphasis on ordinances and temple rites as adding to the gospel. It uses key biblical passages (Rom 3:28; Eph 2:8-9; James 2:14-26; Titus 3:5; Gal 2:16) to ground the critique and rightly cites Galatians 1:6-9 as a warning against adding requirements to the gospel. It also notes the LDS distinction between justification and exaltation and the role of temple ordinances. Minor caveats include an overgeneralization about baptismal authority (see error) and a potential underemphasis of the Catholic/Orthodox nuance that grace and cooperation with grace (not mere “works”) are part of salvation for many historic Christian traditions. Overall, the evaluation aligns well with biblical and historic Christian teaching while acknowledging the LDS position and the core doctrinal disagreements."
