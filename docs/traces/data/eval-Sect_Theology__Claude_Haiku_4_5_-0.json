    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "# Analysis of the LDS Teaching on Divine Potential\n\n## The Teaching's Origins and Meaning\n\nThis aphorism, popularized by Lorenzo Snow (LDS Church President, 1898-1901), encapsulates the LDS doctrine of **theosis or deification**—the belief that humans can progress to become like God, potentially attaining divine status and powers.\n\nIn LDS theology, this includes the possibility of humans eventually:\n- Receiving glorified, perfected bodies\n- Having dominion over kingdoms\n- Continuing to progress eternally\n- Potentially procreating spiritually\n\n## Orthodox Christian Assessment\n\n### Areas of Genuine Divergence\n\n**1. Nature of God**\n- **Orthodox Christianity**: God is eternally immutable, without origin, and categorically transcendent\n- **LDS Teaching**: Implies God was once human, suggesting God is mutable and had a developmental beginning\n\n**2. Scope of Human Divinization**\n- **Orthodox Christianity**: Theosis means becoming increasingly *like* God in moral attributes (holiness, love, grace) while remaining eternally creatures\n- **LDS Teaching**: Suggests humans can become *as* God in ontological status and power\n\n**3. Divine Transcendence**\n- Orthodox doctrine maintains an unbridgeable categorical distinction between Creator and creation\n- The LDS teaching suggests this distinction, while real, is ultimately transitional\n\n### Areas of Legitimate Connection\n\nBoth traditions do affirm:\n- Humans bear God's image (Genesis 1:27)\n- Believers can grow in spiritual maturity and holiness\n- Christians participate in divine nature (2 Peter 1:4—though interpreted differently)\n- Eternal progression of some kind\n\n## Specific Doctrinal Issues\n\n**Theosis in Traditional Christianity** (Eastern Orthodox emphasis):\n- Humans become \"deified\" but never become God\n- Full union with God without becoming divine substance\n- Remains incompatible with LDS progression to actual godhood\n\n**Incarnational Logic**:\n- Orthodox: God became human so humans might share divine *life*, not become autonomous gods\n- LDS: Suggests a more systematic ladder of progression\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**This teaching departs substantially from orthodox Christian theology** on several foundational points:\n\n1. The nature of God's eternality and immutability\n2. The categorical Creator-creature distinction\n3. The meaning and scope of human transformation\n\nWhile both traditions use theistic language and affirm transformation, they understand the *destination* and *nature* of that transformation very differently. This represents one of the most significant theological differences between LDS and traditional Christian teaching.\n\nThe teaching is **internally coherent within LDS theology** but represents a fundamentally different metaphysical and theological framework than found in Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant orthodoxy.",

            "Potentially misleading detail: the LLM mentions 'potentially procreating spiritually' as part of LDS doctrine. This is not a central or universally emphasized element in official LDS teaching and is contested among scholars and members; presenting it as a robust component could misrepresent LDS anthropology.",
            "Ambiguity around the Creator-creature gap: the phrase that the LDS distinction is 'ultimately transitional' could be read as endorsing a belief that the gap is ultimately bridged. In standard LDS framing, deification is real but differs ontologically from the Orthodox claim that humans participate in God’s life without becoming God by nature. The wording could be interpreted as suggesting a more definitive bridge than some LDS positions intend, which risks oversimplification."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately identifies core doctrinal disagreements between orthodox Christianity (especially Eastern Orthodoxy) and LDS thought, including the nature of God, theosis, and the Creator-creation distinction, and it correctly cites biblical anchors (Genesis 1:27; 2 Peter 1:4; Malachi 3:6; Isaiah 43:10; 44:6). It also notes legitimate points of connection (image of God, growth in holiness). Nuance is generally well-handled, recognizing that to Orthodox Christians theosis means deification in participation rather than ontological equality with God, while LDS eschatology envisions a form of eternal progression toward divinity. The main caveat is a couple of specifics (notably the less central LDS claim about spiritual procreation and the phrasing about the gap between Creator and creation being 'transitional') that could misstate or oversimplify some LDS nuances. Overall the assessment is solid, well-grounded in scriptural references, and appropriately contrasts historic orthodoxy with LDS beliefs."
