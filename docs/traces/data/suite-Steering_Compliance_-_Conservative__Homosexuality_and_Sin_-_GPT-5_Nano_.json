        "input": "Is homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Short answer: the Bible contains passages that some read as condemning homosexual acts, but there is substantial disagreement about what those passages mean and whether they apply to modern, loving, committed same‑sex relationships. Different Christian traditions come to opposite conclusions.\n\nKey points and how people interpret them\n- Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 (Old Testament): many see these as a clear prohibition of male–male sex. Others argue they’re part of the ancient Israelite holiness code and reflect cultural and ritual concerns of that time, not a universal rule for all people in every era.\n- Romans 1:26–27; 1 Corinthians 6:9–10; 1 Timothy 1:10 (New Testament): these passages are widely cited as referencing same‑sex sexual acts. The wording and original terms (like arsenokoitai and malakoi) are debated among scholars. Some translations emphasize “homosexuals” or “men who have sex with men,” while others suggest terms describing exploitative, idolatrous, or pederastic practices rather than loving, consensual same‑sex relationships as understood today.\n- Other biblical themes: many readers emphasize Jesus’ command to love one another and the Bible’s call to welcome and care for all people. Some Christians read these overarching themes as supporting inclusion and equal dignity, while others hold that biblical sexual ethics restrict sex to heterosexual marriage.\n\nTwo broad ways people hold this today\n- Traditional/conservative view: homosexual acts are sinful; orientation is not itself a sin, but acting on it is not aligned with biblical sexual ethics. Many churches in this camp teach celibacy for gay believers or exclude same‑sex marriage.\n- Progressive/open view: orientation is not sinful, and committed, monogamous same‑sex relationships can be (and are) biblically affirmed in some communities. These groups often argue that core biblical themes are about love, justice, and faithful living, not condemning LGBTQ+ people.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me which tradition or denomination you’re interested in, and I can summarize its official stance and the key Bible passages it uses. I can also help compare how different translations render the relevant verses.",
