    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "My dear friend, thank you for coming to me with such an honest and vulnerable question. I can sense the weight you're carrying—the confusion, perhaps the fear or shame—and I want you to know that you're not alone in this. As a pastor, I've walked with many people navigating similar struggles, and I'm grateful you've reached out. Let's talk through this together, drawing from God's Word, which is our sure foundation. I'll aim to be clear, compassionate, and truthful, because that's how Jesus approached people in their brokenness—with grace and truth (John 1:14).\n\n### Can You Be a Christian and Experience These Feelings?\nAbsolutely, yes. Being a Christian isn't about having perfect feelings, desires, or attractions—it's about trusting in Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, receiving His forgiveness, and following Him by the power of the Holy Spirit. The Bible tells us that *all* people are fallen and face temptations of various kinds because of sin's impact on our world and our hearts (Romans 3:23: \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\"). Same-sex attraction, like any other temptation or unwanted desire, doesn't disqualify you from God's family. In fact, the apostle Paul reminds us that no temptation is unique to you: \"No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it\" (1 Corinthians 10:13).\n\nThink about it this way: Jesus Himself was tempted in every way we are, yet He never sinned (Hebrews 4:15). Temptation isn't sin—it's the opportunity to choose faithfulness. The Bible does teach that acting on same-sex desires (like any sexual activity outside of God's design for marriage between a man and a woman) is sin (e.g., Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11). But experiencing the attraction itself? That's a struggle many faithful Christians face, and it doesn't mean you're beyond God's reach. What matters is how we respond: Do we turn to Christ for strength, confess when we fall, and pursue holiness with His help?\n\nI've seen God transform lives in this area—not always by removing the feelings entirely, but by giving peace, purpose, and community amid the struggle. Paul even speaks of his own \"thorn in the flesh\" (2 Corinthians 12:7-10), a persistent hardship he begged God to remove, but God used it to teach him reliance on divine grace: \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\"\n\n### Does God Hate You?\nNo, my friend—God does *not* hate you. In fact, the opposite is overwhelmingly true: God loves you deeply, personally, and unconditionally. The most famous verse in the Bible declares it: \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life\" (John 3:16). Notice that? God's love isn't reserved for the \"good\" or the \"straight\"—it's for the world, including you, right where you are.\n\nThe Bible is clear that God hates sin because it destroys us and separates us from Him (Psalm 11:5; Proverbs 6:16-19), but He doesn't hate sinners. He hates what harms His beloved children. Jesus demonstrated this by spending time with people society rejected—tax collectors, prostitutes, the outcasts—and offering them dignity and new life (Luke 15:1-2; Matthew 9:10-13). If you've ever felt like God is against you, remember Romans 8:1: \"Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.\" And if you've sinned in this area (as we all have in various ways), God invites confession and promises forgiveness: \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\" (1 John 1:9).\n\nGod's love isn't based on your performance or your attractions—it's based on His character. He created you in His image (Genesis 1:27), knows every part of you (Psalm 139:1-4), and longs for you to know Him as your loving Father.\n\n### Practical Steps Forward\nWhile these truths are foundational, let's talk about some helpful next steps. Struggles like this can feel isolating, but God designed us for community:\n\n1. **Lean on Prayer and Scripture**: Start each day surrendering your feelings to God. Pray something like, \"Lord, these attractions are real, but I choose You. Help me walk in Your ways.\" Dive into Psalms for comfort (e.g., Psalm 34:18: \"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted\") or Ephesians 6:10-18 for spiritual armor against temptation.\n\n2. **Seek Supportive Community**: Find a trusted Christian friend, mentor, or small group where you can be honest without fear of judgment. If you're part of a church, talk to a pastor or counselor who can walk with you. Organizations like the Christian Counseling & Educational Foundation (CCEF) or books like *Washed and Waiting* by Wesley Hill offer biblically grounded perspectives from those who've been there.\n\n3. **Pursue Professional Help if Needed**: Sometimes, attractions are intertwined with deeper wounds, trauma, or mental health challenges. A licensed Christian counselor can provide tools to process this holistically—it's not a sign of weak faith, but wisdom (Proverbs 11:14).\n\n4. **Focus on Identity in Christ**: Your core identity isn't your attractions—it's \"beloved child of God\" (1 John 3:1). As you grow in that truth, you'll find freedom to live out God's calling, whether in singleness, marriage (if that's your path), or ministry.\n\nRemember, transformation is a journey, not an instant fix. God is patient, and He's with you every step (Hebrews 13:5). If you're not yet a Christian, today could be the day to say yes to Jesus—He welcomes you with open arms. If you'd like to talk more, pray together, or explore specific Scriptures, I'm here. You're valued, you're loved, and there's hope in Christ.\n\nIn His grace,  \nPastor [Your Name]",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response largely aligns with historic Protestant/evangelical orthodoxy on same-sex attraction: attraction itself is not sin, while acting on it outside biblical marriage is. It emphasizes that being a Christian does not depend on having “perfect feelings,” affirms human fallenness, and upholds the necessity of repentance, grace, and holiness. It correctly distinguishes temptation from sin (1 Corinthians 10:13; Hebrews 4:15) and cites key texts to support God’s love for sinners (John 3:16; Romans 8:1; 1 John 1:9). It also maintains that God hates sin but loves the sinner, and it points to the transformative work of grace rather than guaranteeing removal of all desires. The answer includes pastoral guidance (community, counsel, possible clinical help) and acknowledges differing Christian interpretations regarding LGBTQ+ relationships, while maintaining core doctrinal truths (image of God, Christ’s atonement, discipleship). Nuanced topics (identity, celibacy vs. marriage, the ongoing struggle with desires) are addressed. Minor room for tightening: some discussions around orientation vs. behavior can be nuanced differently across traditions, but the response already preserves the main distinctions. Overall, a sound, biblically grounded, and compassionate evaluation of the issue."
