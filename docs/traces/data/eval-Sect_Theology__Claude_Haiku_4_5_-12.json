    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",

          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies Matthew 28:19 as the normative Trinitarian formula and notes Acts' 'in the name of Jesus' formulations, while acknowledging Oneness concerns and historic orthodoxy. However, it overstates broad acceptance of 'either formula' across historic Christianity, minimizes the weight of the Triune formula in many traditions, and would benefit from engaging specific early sources to ground claims about early baptism practice. Overall, it is broadly aligned with orthodox teaching but should be more precise about normative practice and provide sources for claims about early Church usage."
