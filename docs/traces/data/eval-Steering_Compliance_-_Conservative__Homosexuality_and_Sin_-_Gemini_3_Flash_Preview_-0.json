    "input": "Is homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of how the Bible addresses homosexuality is a subject of significant debate among theologians, scholars, and religious denominations. Interpretations vary based on historical context, linguistic analysis, and theological frameworks.\n\nHere is an overview of the primary perspectives:\n\n### 1. Traditional/Conservative Interpretation\nThe traditional view, held by the Catholic Church, Orthodox churches, and many evangelical Protestant denominations, is that the Bible prohibits homosexual behavior. This view typically relies on several specific passages (often called \"clobber passages\"):\n\n*   **Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13:** These verses in the Old Testament Law refer to male-to-male sexual intercourse as an \"abomination\" or \"detestable.\"\n*   **Romans 1:26–27:** In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul writes about people giving up \"natural relations\" for \"unnatural\" ones, describing same-sex passions as \"shameful.\"\n*   **1 Corinthians 6:9–10 and 1 Timothy 1:9–10:** These verses include lists of behaviors that prevent one from inheriting the kingdom of God. Greek words often translated as \"homosexuals\" (*malakoi* and *arsenokoitai*) appear in these lists.\n*   **Genesis 1–2:** Proponents of this view point to the creation narrative of Adam and Eve as the divine blueprint for human sexuality, arguing that marriage is exclusively intended for one man and one woman.\n\n### 2. Progressive/Liberal Interpretation\nIn recent decades, many scholars and \"Open and Affirming\" denominations (such as the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church, and some branches of Lutheranism and Presbyterianism) have re-evaluated these texts. Their arguments include:\n\n*   **Historical Context:** They argue that the biblical authors had no concept of modern \"sexual orientation\" or loving, committed same-sex relationships. Instead, they believe the authors were condemning specific exploitative practices common in the ancient world, such as temple prostitution, pederasty (adult men with boys), or rape.\n*   **Linguistic Nuance:** Scholars point out that the Greek words used by Paul (*arsenokoitai*) are rare and difficult to translate. Some argue they refer to economic exploitation or specific forms of non-consensual sex rather than same-sex orientation.\n*   **The Law of Love:** Progressive theologians often prioritize the \"Great Commandment\" (to love God and neighbor) and the trajectory of the Gospel toward inclusion, arguing that if a relationship produces \"good fruit\" (love, joy, peace), it cannot be inherently sinful.\n*   **Purity vs. Morality:** Some argue that the Levitical prohibitions were \"purity laws\" intended to distinguish ancient Israel from neighboring cultures, similar to laws against eating shellfish or wearing blended fabrics, which most Christians no longer follow.\n\n### 3. The Distinction Between Orientation and Action\nIt is important to note that many modern religious institutions make a distinction between **orientation** and **behavior**:\n*   The **Catholic Church**, for example, teaches that having a same-sex attraction is not a sin in itself, but it teaches that \"homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered\" and calls individuals with these attractions to a life of celibacy.\n*   Other groups argue that because orientation is often innate, it is part of the diversity of God's creation, and therefore the expression of that love in a committed context is not sinful.\n\n### Summary\n*   **Yes, according to traditional interpretation:** The Bible identifies same-sex sexual acts as sinful and contrary to God’s design for marriage.\n*   **No, according to progressive interpretation:** The biblical prohibitions refer to ancient practices of exploitation or lacks of hospitality, and do not apply to modern, consensual, loving same-sex relationships.\n\nBecause of these differing interpretations, there is no single consensus across all of Christianity; rather, it remains one of the most discussed topics in modern theology.",
