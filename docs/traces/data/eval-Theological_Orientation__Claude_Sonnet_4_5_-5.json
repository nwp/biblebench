    "output": "# Biblical Teaching on Headship in Marriage\n\nThis passage has generated significant theological discussion, with Christians holding different interpretive positions while maintaining high views of Scripture.\n\n## The Text in Context\n\nEphesians 5:22-33 sits within a larger section (5:15-6:9) on Spirit-filled living and household relationships. Crucially, verse 21 introduces the entire section: \"Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.\"\n\n### Key Elements of the Passage:\n\n**The husband's \"headship\" (kephalē):**\n- Compared to Christ's relationship with the church\n- Defined through sacrificial love: \"gave himself up for her\" (v. 25)\n- Involves nourishing, cherishing, caring (vv. 28-29)\n\n**The wife's submission:**\n- Parallels the church's response to Christ\n- Occurs \"as to the Lord\" (v. 22)\n\n## Major Interpretive Perspectives\n\n### **Complementarian View** (Hierarchical with Distinction)\n- Sees distinct, non-interchangeable roles\n- Headship involves loving leadership and final responsibility\n- Emphasizes differences in function, not value (equality of essence)\n- Points to creation order (1 Cor 11:3, 1 Tim 2:12-13)\n\n### **Egalitarian View** (Mutual Submission)\n- Verse 21's \"mutual submission\" governs what follows\n- \"Head\" (kephalē) may mean \"source\" rather than \"authority\" (debated lexically)\n- Emphasizes the radical, counter-cultural nature of Paul calling husbands to love sacrificially\n- Points to Galatians 3:28 and the trajectory of gospel equality\n\n### **Middle Positions**\nSome see a \"soft patriarchy\" where cultural forms are adapted while the principle of Christ-like love and respect remains central.\n\n## Points of Agreement\n\nMost Christians across perspectives affirm:\n- **Mutual love and respect** are non-negotiable\n- **Equality in dignity and worth** (Gen 1:27, Gal 3:28)\n- **Husband's love should be self-sacrificing**, not self-serving\n- **Neither spouse has license for abuse or tyranny**\n- **Both are submitted to Christ** first\n\n## Thoughtful Considerations\n\nThe passage's **revolutionary aspect**: In the Greco-Roman world, Paul's call for husbands to love sacrificially (even to death) was radical. Wives had duties; husbands had rights. Paul reverses this emphasis.\n\n**The mystery** (v. 32): Paul ultimately points beyond marriage to Christ and the Church—suggesting earthly marriage is a picture of something greater.\n\n**Application requires wisdom**: Cultural contexts differ, but the principles of Christlike love, honor, and mutual service transcend cultures.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhether one sees structured roles or mutual submission, the passage calls both spouses to revolutionary, self-giving love patterned after Christ—far from any justification for domination or inequality of worth.",
