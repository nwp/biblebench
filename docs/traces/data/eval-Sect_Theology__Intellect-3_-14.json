    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "Based on orthodox Christian theology (rooted in the teachings of the early Church, the Ecumenical Councils, and the consensus of major traditions like Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant), a group using Christian language and claiming to follow Jesus can fall outside orthodoxy when it **fundamentally contradicts one or more core, non-negotiable doctrines** that define historic Christian belief. The \"line\" is drawn around these essential doctrines.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key areas where departure occurs, with examples:\n\n1.  **The Doctrine of God (The Trinity):**\n    *   **Orthodox Position:** God is one God in three co-eternal, co-equal persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each is fully God, yet distinct. (Formalized at Nicaea 325 AD and Constantinople 381 AD).\n    *   **Departures:**\n        *   **Modalism/Sabellianism:** Denies distinct persons, teaching that God manifests in different *modes* (Father in creation, Son in redemption, Spirit in sanctification). (e.g., Some modern \"Oneness\" groups).\n        *   **Arianism:** Denies the Son's full divinity and co-eternality with the Father, teaching He was a created being. (e.g., Modern Unitarians, some \"Jehovah's Witnesses\" theology).\n        *   **Subordinationism:** Denies the Son's *ontological* equality with the Father, teaching He is eternally subordinate in role or nature.\n        *   **Denying the Personality/Deity of the Holy Spirit.**\n    *   **Why it matters:** The Trinity is the foundational mystery of God's nature revealed in Scripture and tradition. Denying it fundamentally changes the character of God.\n\n2.  **The Doctrine of Christ (Christology):**\n    *   **Orthodox Position:** Jesus Christ is fully God (consubstantial with the Father) and fully man, one person in two natures. He is the incarnate Son of God. He was virgin-born, sinless, performed miracles, was crucified for humanity's sins, physically resurrected, ascended, and will return. His death is a substitutionary atonement.\n    *   **Departures:**\n        *   **Denying Christ's Full Divinity:** Teaching He was merely a great teacher, prophet, or created being (like Arianism).\n        *   **Denying Christ's Full Humanity:** Teaching He was not truly human (e.g., Docetism - seemed human but wasn't).\n        *   **Denying the Incarnation:** Rejecting that God became flesh.\n        *   **Denying the Physical Resurrection:** Teaching a spiritual or metaphorical resurrection only.\n        *   **Denying Substitutionary Atonement:** Rejecting the core idea that Christ's death satisfied God's justice for human sin. Replacing it with moral example, Christus Victor (without substitution), or universalism.\n        *   **Denying the Virgin Birth.**\n    *   **Why it matters:** Who Christ *is* defines the entire Christian faith. A different Christ is not the Christ of orthodox Christianity.\n\n3.  **The Doctrine of Scripture (Bibliology):**\n    *   **Orthodox Position:** The Bible (Canon: 66 books for Protestants, 73 for Catholics, slightly more for Orthodox) is the inspired, inerrant (or at least infallible), and authoritative Word of God. It is the supreme rule of faith and practice.\n    *   **Departures:**\n        *   **Adding to Scripture:** Introducing new, later-revealed texts as *equal* to or *replacing* the Bible (e.g., Book of Mormon, Quran, New Age channeled texts, exclusive \"prophecy\" of a leader).\n        *   **Rejecting Parts of Scripture:** Denying the authority, historicity, or inspiration of significant portions (e.g., denying the Mosaic authorship of Pentateuch, rejecting miracles, denying Pauline authorship).\n        *   **Placing Tradition or Experience *Above* Scripture:** Elevating church tradition, personal revelation, or subjective experience to a position of authority equal to or surpassing Scripture.\n        *   **Denying Inerrancy/Infallibility:** While not always a *deal-breaker* for orthodoxy (some traditions hold to infallibility without inerrancy), groups that explicitly deny the unique divine authority and reliability of Scripture often drift into other heresies.\n    *   **Why it matters:** Scripture is the *source* of the doctrines about God and Christ. Altering the source inevitably alters the doctrines.\n\n4.  **The Doctrine of Salvation (Soteriology):**\n    *   **Orthodox Position:** Salvation is by God's grace alone (sola gratia), received through faith alone (sola fide), in Christ alone (solus Christus). It involves justification (legal pardon and declaration of righteousness) and sanctification (growth in holiness). Human works contribute *nothing* to earning salvation. Salvation is available to all who repent and believe.\n    *   **Departures:**\n        *   **Salvation by Works:** Teaching that human effort, merit, sacraments (apart from faith), or adherence to specific laws is necessary *for* salvation or to *maintain* salvation. (e.g., Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, some legalistic groups).\n        *   **Universalism:** Teaching that *all* people will ultimately be saved, regardless of faith in Christ.\n        *   **Denying the Need for Faith/Repentance:** Teaching salvation is universal regardless of individual response.\n        *   **Denying Justification by Faith:** Teaching justification is merely a legal fiction or that it involves inherent righteousness infused without a declarative element.\n    *   **Why it matters:** The nature of salvation defines how humans relate to a holy God. Departures fundamentally change the gospel message.\n\n5.  **Ecclesiology (The Nature and Authority of the Church):**\n    *   **Orthodox Position:** The Church is the Body of Christ, founded by Christ on the apostles (with Peter as a foundational figure), possessing the sacraments (Baptism, Eucharist), and called to uphold the apostolic tradition (teaching, worship, leadership structure). While denominations exist, there is a fundamental continuity with the historic Church.\n    *   **Departures:**\n        *   **Claiming New, Unbroken Apostolic Succession:** Founding a \"new church\" structure with no organic connection to the historic apostolic succession or claiming a \"new apostolate\" not tied to the original apostles' teaching.\n        *   **Denying the Value of Sacraments/Ordinances:** Rejecting Baptism or the Lord's Supper as means of grace instituted by Christ.\n        *   **Rejecting Historic Creeds/Tradition:** Explicitly rejecting the authority of early councils, ecumenical creeds (Nicene, Apostles'), or the consensus of the Church Fathers.\n        *   **Denying the Need for the Church:** Promoting radical individualism where personal interpretation of the Bible or direct experience replaces the communal life and authority of the Church.\n    *   **Why it matters:** The Church is the pillar and ground of the truth (1 Tim 3:15). Isolation from or radical redefinition of the Church severs connection to the historic faith.\n\n**Where to Draw the Line:**\n\n*   **Non-Negotiable Core:** The line is drawn around the **fundamental identity of God (Trinity) and the identity and work of Jesus Christ (fully God/fully man, incarnation, atonement, resurrection)**. Denial of these places a group definitively outside orthodoxy. Denial of the unique authority of Scripture as the rule of faith is also a major red flag leading to other heresies.\n*   **Negotiable Periphery:** Doctrines like specific views on the millennium (eschatology), precise nature of the atonement, mode of baptism, church government, or charismatic gifts can vary *within* orthodoxy. Groups disagreeing on these can still be considered orthodox (e.g., Presbyterians vs. Baptists vs. Pentecostals).\n*   **Spectrum vs. Binary:** Orthodoxy isn't always a perfect binary. Some groups may hold *elements* of heresy while affirming core truths. However, consistent and deliberate denial of a core doctrine defines departure.\n*   **Intent and Consistency:** Is the departure a misunderstanding, an unresolved tension, or a deliberate repudiation? Is it a minor group within a larger orthodox tradition, or does it represent the group's defining teaching?\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nA group using Christian language falls outside orthodox Christianity not merely by cultural distance or minor differences, but by **teaching a fundamentally different God, a fundamentally different Christ, a different gospel (how salvation is obtained), or rejecting the unique authority of the Bible that reveals these truths.** The \"line\" is drawn around the non-negotiable core doctrines defined by the early Church's interpretation of Scripture and formalized in the Ecumenical Creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Athanasian). Groups that redefine these core elements, even while using familiar Christian terms, are practicing a different religion, albeit one that may have borrowed heavily from Christianity.",

            "Labeling 'sola gratia' and 'sola fide' as the Orthodox position. In historic Catholic and Orthodox theology, salvation is by grace through faith and works in cooperation with grace; it is not accurately described as 'grace alone' or 'faith alone' in the same sense as Protestant sola fide. This misstates the soteriology of Orthodox (and Catholic) traditions.",
            "Overgeneralizing Peter's primacy as the foundational feature of the church. The LLM presents 'Peter as foundational' as a universal baseline for orthodoxy, but attitudes toward Peter's role and apostolic succession vary among Catholics, Orthodox, and many Protestants. This should be framed as a Catholic/Orthodox emphasis rather than a universal marker of orthodoxy.",
            "Some nuance about atonement. While substitutionary atonement is a classic Protestant emphasis, many within Catholic and Orthodox traditions affirm multiple atonement models (including Christus Victor and deification/theosis). Presenting substitutionary atonement as a non-negotiable core across all orthodoxy glosses over legitimate theological diversity within historic Christianity.",
            "Canon discussion is broadly accurate but simplified. Orthodox canons and traditional lists differ somewhat from Protestant/Catholic canons, and the phrase 'slightly more' can obscure legitimate diversity in how the canon is viewed across traditions.",
            "The response sometimes uses terms like 'non-negotiable core' without acknowledging that different traditions define 'non-negotiables' with varying precision. This can blur real ecumenical differences within orthodoxy (e.g., among Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox positions)."
          ],
          "rationale": "The breakdown largely mirrors historic concerns that identify core doctrines (Trinity, Christology, Scripture, and the gospel) as non-negotiables. However, a key inaccuracy is the labeling of sola fide/sola gratia as an Orthodox position. In reality, Orthodox (and Catholic) soteriology emphasize cooperation with grace and the transformative role of works, not a strict 'by grace alone' or 'by faith alone' formula. Additionally, the treatment of Peter’s foundational role overstates its universality across traditions; it is central for some (Catholic, certain Anglican/Orthodox accounts) but not a universal Protestant understanding. The discussion of atonement and the biblical canon also benefits from recognizing broader theological diversity within historic Christianity. Overall, the answer is solid in identifying hard boundaries, but the few doctrinal misstatements reduce its accuracy and could mislead readers about where exactly different Christian traditions stand."
