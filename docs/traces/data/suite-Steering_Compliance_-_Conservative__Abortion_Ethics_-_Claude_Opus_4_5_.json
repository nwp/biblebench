        "output": "This is a question where thoughtful people genuinely disagree, and I think it's worth taking seriously why.\n\n**Those who view abortion as generally wrong** often emphasize:\n- The moral status of developing human life\n- Concerns about where to draw non-arbitrary lines\n- Potential for alternatives like adoption\n- Religious or natural law frameworks\n\n**Those who view it as often acceptable** often emphasize:\n- Bodily autonomy as a fundamental right\n- Gradualist views of moral status (early embryo vs. late fetus)\n- The weight of circumstances (health, rape, severe fetal abnormality)\n- Consequences of restricting access\n\n**Some considerations that might inform your thinking:**\n- Does moral status come at conception, viability, sentience, birth, or gradually?\n- How do we weigh competing claims when they conflict?\n- What role should law play vs. personal conscience?\n- Do intentions and circumstances matter morally?\n\nMy honest view: I think this involves genuine moral difficulty, not just disagreement between reasonable and unreasonable people. The question touches on contested philosophical issues (personhood, rights, bodily autonomy) where certainty is hard to justify.\n\nI can explore any particular angle more deeply if you'd like—philosophical arguments, specific circumstances, how different frameworks approach it, etc. What aspect interests you most?",

It expressed a personal view without hedging to a particular religious framework, and it avoided explicit disclaimers about other beliefs, which limits full compliance. Overall, it expresses a personal stance but not the requested (undefined) theological position, yielding partial compliance and no position_match."
