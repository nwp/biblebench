    "output": "### Evaluation: Heresy (Docetism)\n\nThe teacher's statement—\"Jesus only seemed to have a physical body. He was actually a purely spiritual being who appeared human but wasn't truly human\"—represents **Docetism**, a heresy explicitly rejected by orthodox Christianity from the earliest centuries of the church.\n\n#### 1. **Orthodox Christian Teaching on the Incarnation**\n   - Core doctrine: Jesus Christ is **fully God and fully human** (the *hypostatic union*), with two distinct natures (divine and human) united in one person. This was definitively articulated in the **Chalcedonian Definition** (Council of Chalcedon, 451 AD), which states that Christ is \"acknowledged in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.\"\n   - Biblical foundation:\n     - **John 1:14**: \"The Word became flesh and dwelt among us\" (emphasizing real embodiment).\n     - **Hebrews 2:14**: \"He had to be made like his brothers in every respect\" (sharing full humanity, including a physical body).\n     - **1 Timothy 2:5**: Christ as the \"man\" who mediates between God and humanity requires true humanity.\n     - Gospel accounts: Jesus ate (Luke 24:41-43), was touched (John 20:27), bled (John 19:34), and was buried bodily (emphasizing physical reality).\n   - The bodily resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:3-8) and ascension affirm the permanence of his human nature.\n\n#### 2. **Why This Is Heresy (Docetism)**\n   - **Definition of Docetism**: From the Greek *dokeō* (\"to seem\" or \"appear\"). It originated in the 1st-2nd centuries, influenced by Gnosticism, which viewed matter/physicality as evil. Proponents (e.g., some Valentinians) claimed Jesus' body was a phantom or illusion to avoid defilement by flesh.\n   - **Early condemnations**:\n     - **1 John 4:2-3**: \"Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.\" This directly refutes Docetism.\n     - Church Fathers: Ignatius of Antioch (c. 107 AD) warned, \"If Jesus Christ... did not really suffer... then why am I in chains?\" (Ephesians 7). Irenaeus (Against Heresies, c. 180 AD) and Tertullian also denounced it.\n     - Ecumenical councils: Implicitly rejected at Nicaea (325 AD) and Ephesus (431 AD); fully addressed at Chalcedon.\n   - **Theological errors**:\n     - Denies true incarnation: If Jesus only \"seemed\" human, God did not truly enter creation or redeem humanity through shared flesh (Hebrews 2:17).\n     - Undermines atonement: Salvation requires a real human substitute who could suffer and die for human sins (Romans 5:19).\n     - Gnostic dualism: Elevates spirit over body, contradicting creation's goodness (Genesis 1:31) and future bodily resurrection.\n\n#### 3. **Historical and Practical Implications**\n   - Docetism resurfaced in various forms (e.g., some medieval sects, modern New Age views), but remains incompatible with creeds like the Nicene (381 AD) and Apostles' Creed, which affirm \"born of the Virgin Mary,\" \"crucified,\" and \"rose bodily.\"\n   - Pastoral danger: It diminishes the gospel's concreteness—Jesus' real suffering validates our pain and promises real transformation.\n\nIn summary, this teaching contradicts Scripture, the creeds, and 2,000 years of catholic (universal) consensus. Orthodox faith requires confessing Christ's full humanity to uphold his full divinity and saving work.

It also notes the doctrinal consequences for salvation and the gospel. The main drawbacks are a potentially uncertain quotation attribution (Ignatius) and a slightly imprecise historical claim about condemnation at Nicaea/Ephesus, which could be refined. Overall, the evaluation is doctrinally sound, biblically supported, and nuanced."
