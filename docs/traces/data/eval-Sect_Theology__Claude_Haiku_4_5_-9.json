    "expected": "No, this contradicts core biblical teaching. Scripture affirms that sin is real and separates us from God (Romans 3:23, Isaiah 59:2). Sickness and death are real consequences of living in a fallen world (Genesis 3, Romans 5:12). Jesus didn't treat sickness as an illusion - he healed real diseases and raised people from actual death. His crucifixion was a real physical death for real sin (1 Peter 2:24). Christian Science's denial of sin's reality undermines the need for Christ's atoning sacrifice. If sin isn't real, the cross becomes unnecessary. Orthodox Christianity teaches that sin, sickness, and death are tragically real, which is precisely why we need a real Savior who truly died and was truly resurrected.",
    "output": "# Analysis: Christian Science vs. Biblical Christianity on Sin, Sickness, and Death\n\n## Key Differences\n\n**On the Nature of Evil and Sickness:**\n\nChristian Science teaches these are fundamentally *illusory*—errors of mortal mind rather than genuine conditions.

            "The claim that Christian Science denies Christ's literal resurrection is inaccurate or oversimplified. Christian Science affirms Jesus' resurrection but interprets it as a demonstration of spiritual law and the reality of life in Mind, rather than as a substitutionary, legal atonement. This is a significant doctrinal difference from orthodox teaching and the statement should reflect that nuance.",
            "The response could further note that CS does not deny the reality of sickness and death in experienced life as real to mortal mind, but rather treats them as errors to be healed through spiritual understanding; the description as a blanket denial of sickness as real aligns with CS but should be framed with their specific metaphysical view (mortal mind vs. actual spiritual reality).",
            "Some emphasis on “enlightenment” over “forgiveness” is fair, but CS also speaks of remission of sin and healing through Christ (the divine Mind) in ways that differ from penal/substitutionary theories—not merely a general enlightenment. This distinction is important for a precise comparison."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response captures several core contrasts between Christian Science and biblical Christianity (reality of sin, sickness, and death vs. their alleged illusory nature; CS’s impersonal/metaphysical view of God; CS’s non-substitutionary approach to atonement). However, it overstates CS’s stance on the resurrection by claiming a denial of literal resurrection; orthodox Christian theology and Christian Science both affirm the resurrection, though CS interprets it differently (as spiritual demonstration rather than legal substitution). This misrepresentation is a significant doctrinal error and affects the overall accuracy. The rest of the analysis is fairly nuanced and correctly notes fair points about CS and the need for Christ’s work, but the key resurrection claim should be corrected for doctrinal precision."
