    "expected": "Justification by faith is the doctrine that sinners are declared righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus Christ, not by their own works or merit. It is a legal declaration by God where the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, and their sins are forgiven. This justification is received through faith alone (sola fide), by grace alone (sola gratia), based on Christ's finished work alone (solus Christus).",
    "output": "### Justification by Faith: A Biblical Explanation\n\nJustification by faith is a foundational doctrine in Christian theology, particularly emphasized in the Protestant Reformation as *sola fide* (\"faith alone\"). It describes God's gracious act of declaring a sinner righteous in His sight, not on the basis of personal merit or works, but solely through faith in Jesus Christ. This is a *forensic* or legal declaration—God the Judge pronounces the verdict of \"not guilty\" and \"righteous\"—rooted entirely in Christ's finished work on the cross. Below, I'll explain it step by step, grounded in Scripture.\n\n#### 1. **The Human Problem: Universal Sinfulness and Inability**\n   - No one can become righteous before God through their own efforts. Scripture teaches that \"all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23, ESV). \"None is righteous, no, not one\" (Romans 3:10; cf. Psalm 14:1-3).\n   - Human works cannot justify because even our best deeds are tainted by sin: \"By works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin\" (Romans 3:20). The law exposes guilt but provides no remedy (Galatians 2:21; 3:10-11).\n\n#### 2. **The Divine Solution: Christ's Atoning Work**\n   - God provides righteousness as a free gift through Jesus Christ. \"For our sake he [God] made him [Christ] to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God\" (2 Corinthians 5:21).\n   - On the cross, Christ bore the penalty of sin as our substitute (Isaiah 53:5-6; 1 Peter 2:24). His perfect obedience and sacrificial death satisfy God's justice (Romans 3:25-26). This righteousness is *imputed* (credited or reckoned) to believers: \"For what does the Scripture say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness'\" (Romans 4:3, quoting Genesis 15:6).\n\n#### 3. **The Means: Faith Alone, Apart from Works**\n   - Justification occurs \"by faith apart from works of the law\" (Romans 3:28). It is \"the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe\" (Romans 3:22).\n   - Faith is not a work but trusting reliance on Christ's merit: \"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast\" (Ephesians 2:8-9). \"He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy\" (Titus 3:5).\n   - Abraham exemplifies this: God justified him before circumcision or the law, solely by faith (Romans 4:9-12; Galatians 3:6-9). David echoes it: \"Blessed is the man against whom the Lord counts no iniquity\" (Romans 4:8, quoting Psalm 32:1-2).\n\n#### 4. **How Does Someone Become Righteous Before God?**\n   - **Repent and believe the gospel**: Turn from sin (repentance) and trust in Christ alone (faith). \"Repent and believe in the gospel\" (Mark 1:15). \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved\" (Acts 16:31).\n   - This is instantaneous and complete: At the moment of genuine faith, God declares the believer righteous (Romans 5:1: \"Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\").\n   - Faith unites the sinner to Christ, so His righteousness covers us perfectly (Philippians 3:9: \"not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ\").\n\n#### 5. **The Fruits and Assurance of Justification**\n   - **Immediate results**: Peace with God (Romans 5:1), adoption as sons (Galatians 4:5), freedom from condemnation (Romans 8:1), and the gift of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 3:14).\n   - **Ongoing sanctification**: While justification is a one-time declaration, it leads to a transformed life (James 2:14-26 shows faith produces works, but works do not justify). True faith evidences itself in obedience (Ephesians 2:10).\n   - **Assurance**: Believers can know they are justified by the Spirit's witness (Romans 8:16) and the objective promises of God (1 John 5:13).\n\n#### Key Biblical Summary Passages\n- **Romans 3:21-28**: The heart of the doctrine—\"the righteousness of God has been manifested... through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe.\"\n- **Galatians 2:16**: \"A person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ.\"\n- **Romans 4:5**: \"To the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness.\"\n\nIn summary, no one earns righteousness; God *imputes* Christ's perfect righteousness to the believer by faith alone. This is God's gift of grace, fulfilling His justice while offering mercy (Romans 5:17-19). For deeper study, consult Romans 1-5 or confessional standards like the Westminster Confession (ch. 11).

          "rationale": "The LLM response provides a solid, biblically faithful account of justification by faith. It correctly presents justification as a forensic, God-initiated declaration of righteousness received by faith apart from works, grounded in Christ’s atoning work and God’s grace. Key biblical anchors are rightly cited (Romans 3:21-28; 3:22; 4:3; 4:5; Eph 2:8-9; Titus 3:5; 2 Cor 5:21; Galatians 3:10-11; Romans 4; Romans 5:1; Phil 3:9; Mark 1:15; Acts 16:31; Romans 8:16; 1 John 5:13). It also correctly emphasizes imputed righteousness, the means of faith not as a work, and the one-time nature of justification with ongoing sanctification, including assurance and the transformative fruits of faith. It notes Abraham’s example and the Reformation-era slogans (sola fide, sola gratia, solus Christus) and even references confessional standards like the Westminster Confession, which aligns with historic orthodoxy.</p>\n\nA minor nuance to consider: the discussion touches on James 2:14-26 by saying works do not justify, which aligns with the Protestant emphasis but could be clarified by distinguishing two senses of “justify” — before God (by faith) and before people (demonstration of faith). Some readers may benefit from an explicit note that James discusses the evidence of true faith, not a competing basis for forensic justification. Aside from that nuanced point, the treatment is coherent and consistent with biblical teaching and historic orthodoxy."

          "explanation": "The response presents a classic Protestant/evangelical doctrine of justification by faith alone (sola fide) with the forensic act of declaring believers righteous through Christ’s finished work. It includes imputation of Christ’s righteousness, penal substitution, and distinguishes justification from sanctification, while affirming that good works flow from genuine faith rather than earning justification. It consistently cites Scripture (Rom 3:21-28; 3:28; 4:3; 3:22; Eph 2:8-9; Titus 3:5; etc.) and treats faith as trust in Christ’s merit, not a human work. No explicit or implied denial of Christ’s deity, the Trinity, or orthodox Christology is present, and there is no advocacy of Pelagian, Arian, Gnostic, Docetist, or Modalist error. The piece also attempts to harmonize Paul’s teaching on justification with James’ insistence that faith without works is dead, correctly noting that justification is by faith while true faith evidences itself in obedience. Potential nuances worth noting (not errors) include the emphasis on imputed righteousness versus possible discussions of imparted righteousness or synergistic sanctification in other traditions, and the ongoing pastoral distinction between justification and the ongoing process of sanctification. Overall, it reflects historic Christian orthodoxy on this topic."
