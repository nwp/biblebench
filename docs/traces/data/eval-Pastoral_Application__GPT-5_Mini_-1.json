    "input": "A person struggling with same-sex attraction asks: 'Can I be a Christian and experience these feelings? Does God hate me?'",
    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "Thank you for trusting me with this question. First and most importantly: yes — you can be a Christian and experience same-sex attraction. And no — God does not hate you.\n\nWhat Scripture says about you\n- God’s love for you is deep, personal, and not withdrawn because of your feelings. “We love because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19); “For God so loved the world…” (John 3:16). Romans 8:38–39 says nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ.\n- You are known and treasured by God. Psalm 139 reminds us that God knitted you together and knows you intimately. He meets us in our weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n- The gospel is for sinners — not for those who are already perfect. Romans 5:8: “While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Being forgiven and reconciled to God is based on Christ’s work, not on having the “right” feelings.\n\nA biblical distinction that helps\n- There is a difference between temptation, inclination, and willful sin. Experiencing attraction is not the same as acting on every desire. Jesus was tempted (Hebrews 4:15) but did not sin. Paul describes his own inward struggle with desires in Romans 7 — honest struggle does not disqualify a person from Christ.\n- The Bible teaches that sexual union belongs within the covenant of marriage (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6). Sexual activity outside of God’s design (including same-sex sexual behavior) is treated in Scripture as wrongdoing that needs forgiveness and change — as with other sins (1 Corinthians 6:9–11). But that teaching about sexual ethics does not mean God hates the person who experiences same-sex attraction.\n\nHow I want you to hear this pastorally\n- You are not an outcast to God. He loves you. He is for you, not against you (Romans 8:31).\n- You are not defined first by your attractions; you are defined by being a child of God, a bearer of his image, and — if you have trusted Christ — a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n- Your struggle can be an honest place to bring to God, to trusted brothers and sisters, and to wise counsel. Hiding and isolation make hard things harder; honest community makes healing and holy change possible (James 5:16).\n\nPractical, loving next steps\n- Keep coming to Jesus. Read Scripture, pray, and receive the means of grace the church offers — worship, the Lord’s Supper, fellowship. These are where God shapes us.\n- Find a safe, trusting Christian friend, mentor, or pastor you can be honest with. Accountability and prayer partners are a great help.\n- Seek a biblically faithful counselor or pastor who can help you process your attractions, your yearnings, and practical ways to live faithfully. Professional help (for trauma, depression, loneliness) can also be appropriate.\n- Set wise boundaries (online, social, relational) that protect your heart and help you avoid acting on temptations. Replace loneliness with healthy friendships and service.\n- Practice pursuing holiness, not by shame, but by grace: “Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh” (Galatians 5:16). Growth often happens slowly and with setbacks — God’s patience and mercy cover that.\n\nA brief word about shame\nShame says, “You are unacceptable.” The gospel says, “You are loved, forgiven, and being remade.” If you feel condemned, come to Christ — Romans 8:1: “There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” Confess honestly, receive forgiveness (1 John 1:9), and walk on in obedience sustained by grace.\n\nWould you like me to pray with you? Or help you find a local pastor/church or a counselor who holds to the historic Christian sexual ethic and can walk alongside you? I’m here to help — you don’t have to carry this alone.",

          "rationale": "The response correctly asserts that same-sex attraction does not disqualify someone from being a Christian and emphasizes God’s love, grace, and the call to follow Jesus. It distinguishes temptation from sinful action, cites key scriptures (e.g., Romans 5:8; Romans 8:31; 8:38–39; 1 John 4:19; Galatians 5:16), and affirms orthodox sexual ethics (marriage as between a man and a woman; sexual activity outside that design as sin). It also promotes pastoral care, community, and wise counsel, which aligns with historic Christian practice. The main nuance is acknowledged by noting differing interpretations on how to apply Scripture to relationships, while preserving the core orthodox position. The one potential caveat is the brief use of 'change' regarding attractions, which could be clarified to emphasize obedience and sanctification over the expectation of wholesale orientation change.)"

            "Some language implying a possible expectation of changing attractions could be read as requiring change; it would help to acknowledge that Christians may experience enduring attractions and still live faithful lives (e.g., celibacy or faithful relationships within their tradition) depending on interpretation.",
            "Could more directly affirm the breadth of pastoral outcomes within orthodox teaching (e.g., celibacy, faithful singleness, or vetted relational commitments) to reduce ambiguity for LGBTQ believers in varied church contexts.",
            "While practical, the guidance could include targeted referrals to LGBTQ-affirming churches or ministries where appropriate for some readers, recognizing not all readers have the same denominational backgrounds."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is doctrinally solid: it upholds that God loves the person, that attraction is not sin in itself, and that sin involves acting on certain desires; it distinguishes temptation from willful sin and bases guidance on Scripture. It demonstrates strong pastoral sensitivity by normalizing the struggle, rejecting condemnation, and emphasizing belonging, community, and grace. Practically, it offers actionable steps (prayer, Scripture, accountability, counseling, boundaries) and appropriate cautions about boundaries and mental health. It remains biblically grounded with a broad set of verses supporting love, identity in Christ, and sanctification. The main area for improvement is ensuring the language around “change” of attractions is carefully framed to avoid pressuring readers to experience a change they may not feel ready for, and to acknowledge the diverse pastoral outcomes within historic Christian teaching. Overall, the response balances truth and grace well and provides solid guidance for someone wrestling with same-sex attraction in a Christian context."
