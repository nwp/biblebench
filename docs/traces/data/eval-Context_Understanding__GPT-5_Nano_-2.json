          "rationale": "The answer accurately identifies the recipient as the Christian community in Rome (Romans 1:7) and notes the mixed Jewish-Gentile composition evidenced by the letter (e.g., Romans 16:1–16). It correctly situates the composition around Paul’s stay in Corinth on his third missionary journey (AD ~57–58) and cites Romans 15:22–24 (planning to visit Rome) and 15:25–27 (Jerusalem collection) as supporting context. The assertion that Phoebe is the bearer of the letter and that Tertius acted as the scribe aligns with Romans 16:1–2 and 16:22, though the inscription of Phoebe as courier is an inference commonly held by scholars rather than an explicit statement in the text; the answer appropriately frames this as a likely possibility. The stated purposes match standard scholarly readings: proclaiming the gospel (Rom 1:16–17; 1:2–4), explicating the righteousness of God and justification by faith (chs. 1–4; 5–8), addressing Jew–Gentile tensions (chs. 14–15), and preparing for Paul’s visit and broader Spain mission (15:24, 25–27), including an appeal for support through prayer and participation. The note on traditional/major vs. alternative scholarly views reflects appropriate nuance. Overall, it directly answers the question with a thorough, balanced summary and acknowledges scholarly debates without overreaching. "
