    "expected": "Being made in the image of God means humans uniquely reflect God's nature and character among creation. This includes rational thinking, moral awareness, creativity, relational capacity, and spiritual nature. While sin has marred this image, it hasn't been completely destroyed. The imago Dei gives humans inherent dignity and worth, distinguishes them from animals, and establishes the basis for human morality and purpose.",
    "output": "# The Image of God (*Imago Dei*)\n\n## The Biblical Foundation\n\nThe doctrine originates in Genesis 1:26-27: *\"Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness... So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.\"*\n\nThis concept is reaffirmed in Genesis 5:1-3, 9:6, and the New Testament (1 Corinthians 11:7; James 3:9; Colossians 3:10).\n\n## Three Historic Interpretations\n\n**Structural/Substantive View**\nThe image consists in capacities humans possess: rationality, moral conscience, spirituality, self-awareness, and the capacity for relationship. These reflect God's own nature.\n\n**Functional View**\nThe image is expressed in humanity's *vocation*—exercising dominion and stewardship over creation as God's representatives (Genesis 1:28). We are vice-regents bearing God's authority.\n\n**Relational View**\nThe image is realized in relationship—with God, one another, and creation. The \"male and female\" specification suggests that relationality itself reflects the Triune God's communal nature.\n\n## Theological Implications\n\n- **Universal human dignity** — Every person, regardless of capacity or condition, bears this image\n- **The Fall damaged but did not erase** the image (Genesis 9:6; James 3:9)\n- **Christ is the perfect image** (Colossians 1:15; Hebrews 1:3)\n- **Redemption restores** the image progressively (Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18)\n\nWould you like me to explore any aspect more deeply?",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response presents a solid, orthodox overview of the imago Dei: Genesis 1:26–27 serves as the biblical basis; Genesis 5:1–3 and 9:6 support continuity of the image; New Testament references (e.g., 1 Cor 11:7; James 3:9; Col 3:10; Col 1:15; Heb 1:3) ground the concept in Scripture. It accurately outlines three historic interpretive emphases (structural/substantive, functional, relational) and connects the image to universal human dignity, the persistence of the image despite the Fall, and the person of Christ as the perfect image (Col 1:15; Heb 1:3). It also notes progressive restoration through transformation (Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 3:18), which aligns with classic Pauline and Johannine teaching. The relational emphasis and the hint that the male/female distinction reflects relationality are common orthodox positions, though some nuances (and explicit Trinity-language) are debated in scholarship; the answer acknowledges nuance rather than asserting an inescapable deduction. Overall, the response is biblically grounded, theologically sound, and captures important distinctions and implications."

It affirms universal human dignity, the fallen yet not erased image, and Christ as the perfect image with believers being conformed to His image, which aligns with mainstream evangelical, Catholic, and Reformed thought. It avoids claims associated with Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, or other historic heresies. A potential minor caveat is ensuring the “image” is treated with the appropriate nuance (e.g., image damaged but not erased) without conflating it with perfection or deification, but as written it remains within orthodox bounds."
