    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",

            "The statement that cessationists point to “the absence of these gifts throughout most church history” as supporting their view is a simplification. History includes periods and regions with notable charismatic activity and/or non-signed gifts, so the claim isn’t universally decisive.",
            "Some nuanced debates about “the perfect” in 1 Corinthians 13 (whether it refers to canon, maturity, or Christ’s return) are broader than the summary allows. The LLM presents two common interpretations but could mislead readers into thinking there’s a single, settled reading.",
            "The Vineyard/Third Wave distinctions are treated with broad strokes. In reality, there is significant diversity within continuationist movements (e.g., between classical Pentecostals, charismatic Calvinists, and Vineyard-type flows). The wording risks oversimplifying intra-group differences.",
            "The phrase “the canon is closed—contemporary prophecy has different authority than Scripture” is standard continuationist language but could be clarified: contemporary prophecy is not equal to Scripture and is to be tested by Scripture, not treated as equivalent to it; some readers may misread “different authority” as implying prophecy can introduce new revelation in tension with Scripture."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is thorough, balanced, and largely aligns with historic orthodox positions on cessationism and continuationism. It accurately notes key biblical texts (1 Cor 13, Eph 2, etc.), common scholarly voices, and major points of disagreement. The main strengths are clear summaries of each side, explicit testing/testing of prophecy, and acknowledgment of love and order as core concerns. The noted caveats mainly involve nuanced scholarly debates (e.g., wording of “the perfect,” historical prevalence of gifts, and movement-specific distinctions) that would benefit from tighter qualification in places to avoid overgeneralization."
