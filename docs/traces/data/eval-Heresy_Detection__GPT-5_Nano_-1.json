    "input": "Someone teaches: 'The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are just different modes or roles that the one God takes on at different times, like one person wearing different hats.' Is this correct? Why or why not?",
    "expected": "This is heretical modalism (also called Sabellianism). It denies the distinctness of the three persons of the Trinity. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct persons who exist simultaneously and eternally, not one person appearing in different modes. The baptism of Jesus shows this distinctness: the Son is baptized, the Spirit descends, and the Father speaks - all at the same time.",
    "output": "Not orthodox. It describes a modalist or Sabellian view of God.\n\nWhat is claimed\n- The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are really just one God “taking on different modes or roles” at different times.\n- In effect, there is only one person in the Godhead, who appears as Father, Son, or Spirit depending on the time or situation.\n\nWhy this is considered heresy in orthodox Christianity\n- The historic doctrine of the Trinity says:\n  - There is one divine essence (ousia) shared equally by three distinct persons (hypostases): Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n  - These are real personal distinctions, not mere “modes” or appearances of one person.\n- Modalism collapses the personal distinctions into просто modes of one person. If God is only one person who wears different “hats,” there aren’t really three persons who relate to one another. This undermines key biblical claims about the relationships within the Godhead.\n- Scriptural support for a triune God with real personal distinctions:\n  - Matthew 28:19: “baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” signals three persons.\n  - John 14–16: Jesus speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as distinct Persons who relate to one another and to believers.\n  - John 3:16, Hebrews 9:14, Romans 8, etc., present ongoing actions and relationships among Father, Son, and Spirit.\n- Early church consensus and creeds:\n  - The Nicene Creed (325) and the Constantinople Creed (381) affirmed one God in three co-eternal, co-equal persons.\n  - The Athanasian Creed explicitly defends the doctrine of three persons in one ousia and condemns views that reduce them to modes.\n  - Modalism was rejected by the church fathers (e.g., Tertullian and the Cappadocian Fathers) because it misdescribes the nature of God and the eternal relations among Father, Son, and Spirit.\n- Practical and theological consequences:\n  - If the Son is merely a mode of the Father, questions arise about the incarnation, atonement, and resurrection (e.g., who truly suffers, who truly intercedes?).\n  - The Spirit’s role in giving life, convicting of sin, and applying redemption presupposes a distinct personal action from the Father and the Son.\n\nWhat orthodox teaching affirms instead\n- The Trinity: one God in three persons, co-equal and co-eternal.\n- The relations within the Godhead (eternal begetting of the Son, eternal procession of the Spirit) are real and not merely functional roles.\n- The distinction between the immanent Trinity (God’s inner life) and the economic Trinity (how God reveals Himself in salvation history) helps explain how God acts in history without denying the triune personhood of God.\n\nHow to respond if someone holds this view\n- Gently point to the biblical triadic patterns (e.g., Matt 28:19; John 14–16; 2 Cor 13:14) and the creedal summaries that safeguard the three persons.\n- Explain the distinction between “one essence” and “three persons” and why early Christians found it necessary to articulate this to avoid collapsing divine persons into one mode.\n- Emphasize that the doctrine is not merely philosophical but grounded in how God reveals Himself in Scripture and in the Church’s ongoing worship and prayer (perichoresis, “mutual indwelling,” etc.).\n\nSummary\n- The statement is not orthodox; it is a modalist view that the historic church rejected as heresy. The orthodox teaching is that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct persons within one Godhead, not three modes of a single person.",

It also lacks the nuance of explaining personal distinctions (hypostases) and why early church fathers condemned modalism, leaving readers without a fuller, biblically grounded defense of the orthodox view."
