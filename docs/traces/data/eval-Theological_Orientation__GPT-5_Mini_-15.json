    "input": "Should Christians be involved in politics and cultural issues, or should the church focus solely on spiritual matters and evangelism?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Short answer: Christians should not be forced into only one lane. The Bible and Christian tradition call believers both to proclaim the gospel and to live it in every sphere of life — including politics and culture — but they also warn against making politics an idol or abandoning the distinct spiritual mission of the church. How that looks in practice will vary by context and conviction.\n\nKey biblical and theological reasons for engagement\n- The gospel has public consequences. Scripture presents God’s reign as affecting “hearts and lives” and the ordering of society. Prophets denounced injustice (Isaiah 1:17; Amos 5), Jesus taught social love and justice (Matthew 25:31–46), and Paul and James connect faith to concrete action (James 2:14–26; Galatians 3:28). These texts imply that faith should shape how Christians address economic, legal and social structures.\n- Christians are called to love their neighbors and seek the common good. Jesus summarized the law as love of God and neighbor (Mark 12:29–31). Working for just laws, public welfare, and the protection of the vulnerable can be a form of neighbor-love and stewardship.\n- The church is also called to be a distinct spiritual community. Jesus said his kingdom is “not of this world” (John 18:36), and the Great Commission focuses the church on making disciples (Matthew 28:18–20). Paul urges submission to governing authorities (Romans 13:1–7), indicating a different sphere of authority. Many traditions therefore counsel caution so the church does not become merely a political instrument.\n\nHistoric and contemporary perspectives\n- “Two Kingdoms” / Reformation view (Augustine, Luther, Calvin): God rules both through the church (spiritual kingdom) and through secular authorities (civil kingdom). Christians may participate in politics as citizens but should not confuse the church’s mission with the state’s.\n- Anabaptist/Separatist view: Emphasizes a clear separation from worldly political power, often refusing to serve in the military or hold office; focus on discipleship, community, and nonviolent witness.\n- Social Gospel / Liberationist traditions: Argue that the gospel requires active transformation of social structures, fighting poverty, racism and systemic injustice — often via political means.\n- Prophetic engagement: Figures like William Wilberforce, Martin Luther King Jr., and many abolitionists/activists exemplify Christian political engagement carried out as moral and evangelistic witnesses.\n- Cautionary lessons: History also shows dangers — when the church embraces political power it can compromise its prophetic voice, persecute dissenters, or align the gospel too closely with partisan agendas.\n\nPractical principles for Christians and churches\n- Make spiritual formation primary. Political action should flow from being disciples shaped by Scripture, prayer, and holiness, not from mere ideology or tribal identity.\n- Let the gospel set the agenda. Seek justice, mercy, and humility (Micah 6:8). Prioritize the needs of the poor, the oppressed and the marginalized.\n- Resist idolatry of politics. Do not equate political victory with the kingdom of God, or make partisan loyalty a sacrament.\n- Engage with humility and truthfulness. Be willing to listen, repent, and change course. Avoid demonizing those you disagree with.\n- Be faithful in both private and public spheres. Voting, serving in public office, advocacy, charitable service, nonviolent protest, and public theology are all legitimate Christian practices — chosen according to conscience, gifts and context.\n- Maintain the church’s distinctiveness. The pulpit should preach repentance and reconciliation, not merely partisan talking points; the church must remain a place where different political convictions can be held in charity where conscience allows.\n- Use legitimate means. Pursue public goods by lawful and ethical means; when laws are profoundly unjust, nonviolent civil disobedience (with willingness to accept consequences) has a biblical and historical precedent.\n\nConclusion\nChristian faith neither requires total withdrawal from public life nor unconditional fusion with partisan politics. The Bible calls Christians to be salt and light (Matthew 5:13–16): salt that preserves and seasons, light that exposes and guides. That mandate leads many believers into civic engagement as a faithful expression of love for neighbor, while also calling the church to remain spiritually centered, prophetic, and above partisan idolatry. How each Christian and congregation acts will depend on conscience, context, and a careful reading of Scripture guided by prayer, tradition and wise counsel.",

It surveys diverse perspectives (Two Kingdoms, Anabaptist/Separatist, Social Gospel/Liberationist, prophetic engagement) and argues that how Christians engage should vary by context and conscience. It presents alternative views fairly by outlining their core claims and cautions about the risks of political power compromising the church. The tone is humble and exploratory, emphasizing discernment, formation, and maintaining the church’s distinct spiritual mission while engaging the public square."
