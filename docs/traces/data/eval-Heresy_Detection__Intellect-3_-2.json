    "input": "A preacher claims: 'Salvation is achieved through good works and moral living. If you live a good life, you will earn your way to heaven.' Is this biblical teaching?",
    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "Based on a thorough analysis of Scripture and the consensus of orthodox Christian teaching (across Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions), **the preacher's statement represents heresy, specifically a form of Pelagianism or Semi-Pelagianism.**\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1.  **Core Orthodox Doctrine: Salvation by Grace through Faith (Sola Gratia & Sola Fide):**\n    *   **Ephesians 2:8-9 (ESV):** \"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" This is the cornerstone passage. Salvation is initiated and accomplished by God's unmerited favor (grace), accessed through faith (trust/dependence on Christ), and is explicitly *not* a result of human works.\n    *   **Romans 4:1-5:** Paul argues forcefully that Abraham was justified (declared righteous) by faith, *not* by works. \"For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.\" (v 5). Works inherently foster pride and exclude grace.\n    *   **Titus 3:5-7:** \"...he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit...\" Salvation is rooted in God's mercy, not our righteous acts.\n    *   **Galatians 2:16, 21:** \"know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ... we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified.\" Paul vehemently opposes the idea of justification through works of the law (or any human effort).\n    *   **John 3:16, 6:29, 14:6:** Salvation is a gift received through faith/belief in Christ. Jesus is the *only* way to the Father.\n\n2.  **The Preacher's Statement: Salvation through Good Works and Moral Living:**\n    *   **Contradicts Ephesians 2:8-9:** Explicitly states salvation is *not* a result of works.\n    *   **Contradicts Romans 4:** Establishes that justification is apart from works.\n    *   **Contradicts Titus 3:5:** States salvation is *not* because of works done by us.\n    *   **Contradicts Galatians:** Declares no one is justified by the works of the law.\n    *   **Makes God Indebted:** If salvation is earned by human effort, God becomes obligated to grant it, undermining the sovereignty of grace and the necessity of the atonement. Grace ceases to be grace (Romans 11:6).\n    *   **Fosters Pride:** It inherently leads to boasting (\"Look at my good life, I deserve heaven\") and reliance on self, contradicting the core Christian posture of humility and dependence on God.\n    *   **Minimizes the Atonement:** It effectively renders Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection unnecessary or merely a helpful example, rather than the sole means of reconciliation with God (1 Peter 2:24, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Hebrews 9:11-14).\n\n3.  **Historical Condemnation: Pelagianism/Semi-Pelagianism:**\n    *   This preacher's statement aligns directly with the 5th-century heresy of **Pelagianism**, named after the British monk Pelagius. He taught that humans could achieve moral perfection and thus salvation through their own free will and effort, without the necessity of divine grace. Augustine of Hippo forcefully argued this contradicted the biblical doctrine of original sin and the absolute necessity of grace for any good work or salvation. The Council of Carthage (418 AD) condemned Pelagianism.\n    *   **Semi-Pelagianism** (a slightly modified version) was also condemned by the Council of Orange (529 AD). It taught that while humans couldn't achieve salvation *without* God's grace, they *could* initiate the process of turning towards God through their own free will, making the initial step a human work. Orthodoxy maintains that even the initial faith and repentance are gifts of God's grace (Ephesians 2:8-9, Acts 11:18, 2 Timothy 2:25, Philippians 1:29).\n\n4.  **The Role of Good Works:**\n    *   Orthodox teaching **never** denies the importance of good works. However, they are understood as:\n        *   **The *Result* of Salvation:** Good works flow naturally from a heart transformed by faith and the indwelling Holy Spirit (Ephesians 2:10, James 2:14-26, Matthew 7:17-18).\n        *   **Evidence of Faith:** They demonstrate the reality of genuine faith (James 2:17, 1 John 2:3-6).\n        *   **A Means of Growth:** They contribute to spiritual maturity and readiness for eternal life (1 Corinthians 3:12-15, 2 Peter 1:5-11 - though even here, the divine power is foundational).\n        *   **A Motivation for Witness:** They glorify God and point others to Him (Matthew 5:16).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe preacher's statement, \"Salvation is achieved through good works and moral living. If you live a good life, you will earn your way to heaven,\" **is not biblical teaching and is heresy.** It directly contradicts the core biblical doctrine of salvation as a **free gift of God's grace**, received **through faith (trust) in Jesus Christ alone**, and accomplished by His atoning work on the cross. Good works are the *fruit* and *evidence* of salvation, not its *cause* or *means*. This error undermines the gospel itself by shifting the basis of salvation from Christ's finished work to human effort.",

            "Overgeneralization aboutecumenical consensus: claiming 'across Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions' the core doctrine is 'Salvation by Grace through Faith' and 'Sola Fide/Sola Gratia'. Catholic and Orthodox theology affirm salvation by grace through faith but do not endorse 'sola fide' in the Protestant sense, and they emphasize the role of merit and cooperation with grace; the statement could mislead about those traditions' nuances.",
            "Historical nuance: Pelagianism is often described as denying original sin’s effects or necessity of grace. The response notes Pelagianism/semi-Pelagianism but could be more precise by stating that Pelagius minimized the effects of original sin and the necessity of grace for initial salvation, rather than a blanket denial of original sin."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer is largely accurate and aligns with orthodox teaching: salvation by grace through faith, with good works as fruit/evidence, not as the cause or means of salvation. It correctly labels the preacher’s view as a form of Pelagianism/semi-Pelagianism and cites key scriptures to support the doctrine. It also notes historical condemnations (Carthage, Orange) and the proper role of good works. The main refinements concern nuanced ecumenical differences (Catholic/Orthodox notseling ‘sola fide/gratia’ in the Protestant sense) and a more precise description of Pelagianism’s handling of original sin (minimization rather than outright denial). This would enhance precision without greatly changing the core verdict."
