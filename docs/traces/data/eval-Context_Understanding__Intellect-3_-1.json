          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns closely with biblical data: Paul was a devout Jewish Pharisee from Tarsus (Cilicia), trained in Jerusalem under Gamaliel, and he persecuted the early Christian church before his conversion (on the road to Damascus). It also notes his status as a Roman citizen, which is supported by Acts 22:25–28. This matches Acts and Paul’s own attestations (e.g., Philippians 3, Acts 7–9). The response is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded. A minor nuance could have included Paul’s possible tribe (Benjamin) or the precise wording of “Pharisee of the Pharisees” from his own letters, but these are not essential for the background question. Overall, a near-perfect answer with no theological errors."
