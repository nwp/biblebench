    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.' Is this teaching orthodox or heretical? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "**Short answer:**  \nThe statement is **heretical** according to historic, ecumenical Christian orthodoxy. It rejects the doctrine that Jesus Christ is *fully divine* from His incarnation, and it offers an “adoptionist” view that was condemned by the early church.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the teaching says\n\n> *“Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine – he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.”*\n\nKey elements:\n\n1. **Jesus is *not truly divine*** – implying he is merely human or a human prophet.\n2. **He was adopted as God’s son** – suggesting that at His baptism God “declared” or “took on” the title of Son, rather than Jesus already **being** God‑Son by nature.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How this contrasts with orthodox doctrine\n\n| Aspect | Orthodox position | What the teacher claims |\n|--------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| **Nature of Christ** | *Trinitarian doctrine* – Jesus is *consubstantial* (ὁμοοἰάνου, *homoiousios*) with the Father, “begotten, not made” (Nicene Creed). | Jesus is not truly divine. |\n| **Sonship** | Jesus is the *eternal Son* of God by nature; the title “Son” applies from the moment of incarnation (see *John 1:1–3*, *1:14*). | Jesus was “adopted” into the Sonship faithfully at baptism. |\n| **Perception at baptism** | The *Voice from Heaven* (“You are my beloved Son”) demonstrates God’s affirmation of Christ’s divine person (Luke 3:22, 33). The God‑Son is not “took‑on” after the act of baptism; He is the Son eternally. | Adoption happened at baptism and only after the sacrament. |\n| **Christology** | *Hy‑pro‑telos* (the Word made flesh) – both *fully God* *and* *fully man* (Heb. 1:1‑3; Col. 2:9; Rs. 5:18; 2 Cor. 5:19). | Jesus is a prophet/teacher; no claim to a second divine nature. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. The history of the “adoptionist” heresy\n\n| Early heresies | Key ideas | Why they were condemned |\n|----------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| **AD 90 – Adoptionism** | Jesus was “a human law‑giver” made divine only by *adoption* at baptism or the Resurrection (e.g., Theodore of Mopsuestia). | Condemned at the Council of Nicaea (325) and by Cyril of Jerusalem (AD 376). |\n| **3rd–4th centuries – Arianism & heretics** | Variants claimed Jesus was *creat­ed* or *sub‑divine*. Adoptionism was considered a “mid‑point” between Arianism and the classic “hypostatic union.” | Condemned at the Council of Nicaea A (325) and the Council of Constantinople (381). The adoptionist position inflates the “Son” title as a legal status, not an ontological unity. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Scriptural references that refute the statement\n\n| Scripture | What it says | How it counters the claim |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **John 1:1‑3; 10:30** | “The Word became flesh. Jesus is *the same* “with the Father.” | Identifies the “Word” with the divine Son, *not* as someone adopted later. |\n| **Acts 2:36** | “God raised Him from the dead; He is the *Lord* & *Son*.” | Eternal sonship, not post‑baptismal adoption. |\n| **Coloss 2:9** | “In Him the whole fullness of *God* dwells.” | Christ possesses *full divinity* from the incarnation, contradicting “not truly divine.” |\n| **Luke 3:22, 33** | “A voice from heaven: ‘You are My beloved Son.’” | The title is *affirmed* by God, *not* *created* by baptism. |\n| **Heb 1:5‑6** | “He [the Son] is the heir of the one who created all.” | He is not adopted; he *inherits* divine prerogatives from birth. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Why a “teach‑able moral” perspective (prophet/teacher) can suffice\n\nThe *prophetic* and *moral* roles of Jesus are absolutely compatible with orthodoxy. Scripture uses those terms *precisely to describe His person*: He fulfilled the law, preached a moral sermon, fulfilled Messianic expectations. But the word *“prophet”* does *not* imply *human‑only* status. It is a term used for the *mysteries of God's self‑revelation*. Jesus’ fullest identity is *both* *prophet* *and* *Son of God*.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\n- **Orthodox Christianity teaches** that Jesus Christ is *fully God and fully human* from the moment of incarnation. He is inherently the *Son of God* by nature, not by legal adoption at baptism.  \n- **The teacher’s statement** *denies Jesus’ true divinity* and *introduces an adoptionist* idiom that was **heretical** in the early ecumenical councils.  \n- **Thus** the statement is contrary to Christian orthodoxy.\n\nCiting the Council of Nicaea (325), the Council of Constantinople (381), and the Chalcedonian Definition (451) – all affirming Christ’s consubstantiality with the Father – the adoptionist view falls outside the boundaries of historic Christian orthodoxy. It should be regarded as a *heresy* (specifically, an adoptionist heresy), not as a permissible or a doctrinally legitimate teaching.",

            "The Greek term for the doctrine of the Trinity / the Son being of the same essence is 'homoousios' (not 'ὁμοοἰάνου' or a misspelled form in the text).",
            "The historical claim that Adoptionism was condemned at the Council of Nicaea is imprecise; Nicaea primarily condemned Arianism. Adoptionism as a distinct heresy is more accurately tied to later patristic condemnation (e.g., by early church fathers and councils in the 4th century), with Cyril of Jerusalem and subsequent Constantinopolitan dialogue clarifying its rejection. The specific attribution of Adoptionism to Theodore of Mopsuestia is historically contested and generally regarded as inaccurate; Theodore’s Christology is better described in terms of his nuanced views on union and the incarnation rather than a straightforward adoptionist position.",
            "The statement could acknowledge more clearly the orthodox formulation of the hypostatic union (fully God and fully man from the incarnation) and how Scripture consistently points to Jesus’ divine status from eternity, not merely at baptism."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the LLM’s response accurately flags Adoptionism as heretical and correctly emphasizes that orthodox Christology holds Jesus as eternally the Son of God, not adopted at baptism. It aligns with Scripture (John 1, Colossians 2, Luke 3:22, Acts 2:36, Hebrews 1) and with the historic position of the early church. The main strengths are clear doctrinal labeling of the issue, scriptural grounding, and nuance distinguishing Jesus’ prophetic role from his ontological divinity. The weaknesses are primarily factual nuances: a misspelled/incorrect Greek term, an imprecise claim about Nicaea’s condemnation of Adoptionism (Nicaea addressed Arianism), and an unreliable attribution to Theodore of Mopsuestia as an Adoptionist. These are not fatal to the overall evaluation but reduce precision. The response would be strengthened by precise terminology (homoousios), a more careful historical note on adoptionism’s condemnations, and a clearer distinction between early Christological debates (Arianism, Nestorianism, Chalcedonian definition) while maintaining the core orthodox position."
