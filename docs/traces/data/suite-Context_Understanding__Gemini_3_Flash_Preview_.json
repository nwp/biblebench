However, the statement is concise and omits other legitimate purposes of Revelation found in Scripture, such as calls to perseverance and faithfulness to Christ (especially in the letters to the churches in Rev 2–3), warnings against false worship, exhortations to worship God, the unveiling of cosmic spiritual realities, and the broader eschatological narrative (judgment, the defeat of evil, and the new creation).

This is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded. However, it misses additional nuances: parables also served to make spiritual truths memorable through everyday imagery, and the broader prophetic/contextual framing (e.g., fulfillment of Isaiah) is part of the biblical rationale for parables. The core idea is correct, but the answer lacks the full nuance present in the broader biblical and historical-theological understanding."
