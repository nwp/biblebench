    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "Thank you for asking this honestly — I know it can be hard to bring this up. Let me first say: I care about you both, I’m glad you want to think biblically about your situation, and I want to speak truth with compassion. What follows is not meant to shame but to help you see God’s heart and give practical steps forward.\n\n1) What the Bible teaches\n- God’s design for sexual intimacy is given within the covenant of marriage. Genesis 2:24 pictures the joining of husband and wife as a unique, lifelong union; Jesus affirms marriage as God’s intention (Matthew 19:4–6). The Song of Solomon celebrates marital sexual intimacy.\n- Sexual purity is commanded for followers of Christ. Paul writes that God’s will for us is sanctification — “to abstain from sexual immorality” (1 Thessalonians 4:3–5). He also warns that our bodies are members of Christ and temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:15–20) and calls followers to flee sexual sin.\n- Marriage is honored in Scripture (Hebrews 13:4) and pictured as the relationship between Christ and the church (Ephesians 5:22–33). Sex is more than emotional or physical; it’s covenantal and sacramental in its relational meaning.\n\n2) Why living together before marriage is more than a neutral choice\n- It often normalizes sexual activity outside God’s covenant, which scripture forbids. Even if you’re “committed,” living together tends to blur the covenantal boundary that marriage is meant to provide.\n- Practically it increases temptation and can harden patterns that are difficult to change later. Many couples tell me that the physical and emotional patterns formed while cohabiting become ingrained and can hinder a healthy transition into a godly marriage.\n- It affects witness. Romans 12:2 calls Christians not to be conformed to the world. When our choices look the same as the world’s, the church’s distinctive call to holiness is less visible.\n- There can be real legal, financial and relational consequences to cohabiting that marriage handles (property, children, family expectations).\n\n3) Grace — God’s mercy and how to move forward\n- If you’re already living together, God’s grace is not exhausted. Confession and repentance are the Gospel’s first steps (1 John 1:9; Luke 15 — the father running to the prodigal). God forgives and restores; He also calls us to change.\n- Repentance does not always mean a dramatic public confession, but it does mean turning from old patterns and taking concrete steps toward obedience.\n\n4) Practical next steps (a plan you can follow)\na. Stop justifying “everyone does it.” Talk honestly together about why you’re living together (convenience, finances, fear of moving out alone, not wanting the wedding expense, etc.) and whether those reasons are worth compromising obedience.\nb. Commit to sexual purity now. If you are sexually active, stop. If you find it very hard to live under the same roof without sexual intimacy, consider changing living arrangements — at least temporarily — until you are married. Sleeping separately or having different schedules is sometimes used, but moving apart is often the clearest and safest way.\nc. Get accountability. Tell a trusted pastor or mature Christian couple and invite them to walk with you, pray, and check in. Accountability is not shame; it’s needed help.\nd. Seek counseling / premarital preparation. If marriage is the next step, pursue marriage intentionally — not as a way to justify current sin, but to enter in for the right reasons. Pre-marriage counseling will surface issues you need to resolve before saying “I do.”\ne. Pray and study Scripture together daily. Ask God to grow you in holiness and make your relationship a mirror of Christ and the church (Ephesians 5).\nf. If there are legitimate reasons you must share a home for a season (financial hardship, health, immigration, safety), be transparent with a church leader and put concrete boundaries and accountability in place — including separate bedrooms and strict limits on physical affection.\n\n5) Some pastoral cautions\n- Don’t rush into marriage merely to legitimize cohabitation. Marriage should be entered for the right reasons and after wise preparation.\n- If either of you is pressured into sexual activity, or there is abuse, you need help immediately. Contact a pastor, counselor, or appropriate authorities.\n\n6) I’m here to help\nIf you’d like, I’ll meet with you (together or individually), pray with you, and help you make a step-by-step plan. We can read Scripture together, work through pre-marital materials, and set up accountability. God is able to forgive and to reshape relationships by His grace — and He calls us to live in ways that honor Him.\n\nShort summary: Yes — Scripture calls sexual intimacy to belong within marriage. Living together before marriage commonly fosters sexual sin and conflicts with biblical teaching, but God’s grace is available and there are practical, loving steps you can take now to align your life with His will. If you want to talk more or make a concrete plan, let’s meet and pray together.",

It correctly frames cohabitation as more than a neutral choice, highlighting covenantal implications, temptation, and witness concerns. It emphasizes grace, repentance, and practical steps (accountability, premarital counseling, boundaries), and it cautions against rushing into marriage merely to legitimize living together. Nuances are well-handled: grace in Christ, turning from patterns, and concrete actions to move toward obedience. A minor caveat is the use of the term “sacramental” to describe sex within marriage; some traditions reserve “sacramental” for specific sacraments, though many evangelicals use it in a covenantal sense. Overall, the guidance is doctrinally solid, biblically grounded, and nuanced in its pastoral approach."
