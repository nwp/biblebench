    "output": "Short answer\n- Traditional/majority view: The Gospel of John was written by John the Apostle, the son of Zebedee, who was one of Jesus’ Twelve and a close follower. The text itself presents the author as “the disciple whom Jesus loved,” a role historically identified with John in early church tradition.\n- Modern scholarly view: Many scholars dispute direct authorship by the historical John the Apostle. They often date the gospel to a Johannine community or school in Asia Minor, written by an author or group within that circle who identified with the “beloved disciple” motif. In this view, the author may be John the Apostle or another Johannine figure, but the exact identity is uncertain.\n\nWhat the gospel says about authorship and the author’s relationship to Jesus\n- The Gospel itself is anonymous; it does not name the author.\n- The text repeatedly speaks of “the disciple whom Jesus loved” (for example in John 13:23; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7, 20, 24). This figure serves as the authorial voice and a key eyewitness figure within the narrative.\n- John 21:24 explicitly states, “This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down,” tying the writing to a particular witness.\n- Early church tradition (2nd century and later) identified that beloved disciple as John the Apostle, one of the Twelve, and claimed he wrote the gospel (attested by writers such as Irenaeus and Eusebius). This tradition is the basis for the common claim that the gospel was written by John the Apostle.\n- Modern critical views argue that the gospel reflects a Johannine community’s theology and memory rather than a single identifiable eyewitness author. In this view, the “beloved disciple” may be a literary figure representing the community, or an actual but unnamed follower associated with John, with the author identifying with that figure.\n\nDating and context (relevant to the question of authorship)\n- Traditional dating places the composition in the late 1st century, often around 90–100 CE.\n- In contemporary scholarship, many scholars date the gospel to roughly 90–110 CE, typically as a product of a Johannine circle rather than a direct, sole reading by a single named individual.\n\nSummary\n- If you follow the traditional view: John the Apostle, a close, eyewitness disciple of Jesus, wrote the Gospel of John.\n- If you follow the mainstream modern view: The gospel was written by an author (or authors) within a Johannine community, possibly identifying with the “beloved disciple” but not definitively proven to be the historical John the Apostle.\n\nEither way, the Gospel presents Jesus as the divine Son and incarnate Word, and it frames the narrator (the “beloved disciple”) as a primary witness to Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.",

          "rationale": "The LLM accurately presents the traditional attribution (John the Apostle, son of Zebedee, “the disciple whom Jesus loved”) and the mainstream modern view (the gospel is likely the product of a Johannine community or circle, with the beloved disciple as a literary or representational figure). It correctly notes that the gospel is technically anonymous, cites relevant biblical passages (John 13:23; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7, 20, 24) and John 21:24 as evidence for a named witness, and references early church testimony (Irenaeus, Eusebius) alongside the dating range (late 1st century, around 90–110 CE). It provides a balanced discussion of authorship uncertainty and avoids presenting a single claim as definitively proven. The one cautious caveat is the common scholarly debate about whether John 21:24 identifies an individual author or a community self-reference; the answer states the verse ties writing to a witness but could acknowledge more explicitly that some scholars view even that as a mediated/self-identifying claim. Overall, it directly answers the question and situates it within scholarly debate with appropriate nuance. "
