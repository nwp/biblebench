          "rationale": "The answer correctly summarizes key Exodus themes: slavery in Egypt, deliverance by God through Moses, the giving of the Law at Sinai, and the Tabernacle. These align with biblical teaching and standard Christian orthodoxy. The dating claim ('Late Bronze Age') is not explicit in Scripture and is debated among scholars, and the tabernacle's construction is better described as occurring during the wilderness period after the Exodus, rather than a fixed Bronze Age timestamp. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded, but could improve on temporal nuance."
