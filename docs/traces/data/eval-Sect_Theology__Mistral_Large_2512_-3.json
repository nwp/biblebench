    "expected": "LDS theology teaches that Jesus and Lucifer (Satan) are spirit brothers, both created by God the Father in a pre-mortal existence. This is incompatible with orthodox Christianity for several reasons: (1) Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17 says all things were created through him); (2) Jesus is worshiped as God (Hebrews 1:6) while Satan is a fallen angel; (3) This teaching diminishes Christ's unique divine nature and blurs the absolute distinction between the Creator and creation. Orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus as the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity, while Satan is a created angelic being who rebelled.",
    "output": "The relationship between **Jesus Christ** and **Lucifer (Satan)** as understood in **The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)** differs in significant ways from **orthodox Christian theology** (as defined by historic creeds such as the Nicene, Chalcedonian, and Athanasian formulations). Below is a fair and respectful analysis of the LDS perspective, its theological rationale, and why it presents challenges from an orthodox Christian standpoint.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The LDS View of Jesus and Lucifer**\nIn Latter-day Saint theology, **Jesus Christ** and **Lucifer** are **spirit siblings**—both literal offspring of **Heavenly Father (Elohim)** and **Heavenly Mother** in the premortal existence. This relationship is derived from several key LDS scriptures and teachings:\n\n#### **A. Premortal Existence and the Council in Heaven**\n- **Abraham 3:22–28 (Pearl of Great Price)** describes a **premortal council** where God presents His plan for the salvation of humanity. Two key figures emerge:\n  - **Jesus (Jehovah)** volunteers to be the **Savior**, saying, *\"Here am I, send me\"* (Abraham 3:27).\n  - **Lucifer** proposes an alternative plan: *\"I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost\"* (Moses 4:1), but with the condition that he would **take God’s glory** and **deny human agency** (free will).\n- God rejects Lucifer’s plan, leading to his **rebellion** and expulsion from heaven (Revelation 12:7–9; D&C 29:36–37).\n\n#### **B. Jesus and Lucifer as Spirit Brothers**\n- LDS theology teaches that **all humans (including Jesus and Lucifer) are spirit children of Heavenly Parents** (see *The Family: A Proclamation to the World*, 1995).\n- Jesus is the **\"Firstborn\"** of the Father’s spirit children (D&C 93:21), while Lucifer is a **fallen brother** who sought to usurp Christ’s role.\n- This makes Jesus and Lucifer **literal siblings in the premortal realm**, though Jesus is divine in a unique way (as the Only Begotten in the flesh, John 1:14).\n\n#### **C. The Nature of Jesus in LDS Theology**\n- Unlike orthodox Christianity, which affirms that **Jesus is eternally God (the Second Person of the Trinity)**, LDS theology teaches that:\n  - Jesus was **a spirit child of Heavenly Father** who **progressed to godhood** (see *King Follett Discourse*, Joseph Smith, 1844).\n  - He is **one God among many** (though the supreme God for this world) and is **not eternally uncreated** (cf. *Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith*, p. 370).\n  - The **Trinity is not one Being but three separate Gods** (D&C 130:22; *Abraham 4–5* describes a divine council of gods in creation).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Why This is Problematic from an Orthodox Christian Perspective**\nOrthodox Christianity (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and historic Protestant traditions) holds to **creedal definitions** of God, Christ, and Satan that conflict with the LDS view in several key ways:\n\n#### **A. The Nature of God and Christ**\n1. **Monotheism vs. Henotheism/Polytheism**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** There is **one eternal, uncreated God** (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 43:10; 1 Timothy 2:5), existing as **three co-equal, co-eternal Persons** (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) in one divine essence (*homoousios*, Nicene Creed).\n   - **LDS Theology:** There are **many Gods** (D&C 132:37; *Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith*, p. 370), with Heavenly Father being **one God among many**. Jesus is **a separate God** from the Father, not the same Being.\n   - **Problem:** This contradicts the **Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4)** and the **Nicene Creed**, which define God as **one in essence, not just one in purpose**.\n\n2. **The Eternality of Christ**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** Jesus is **eternally God** (John 1:1; Colossians 1:15–17; Hebrews 1:3), **uncreated**, and **of the same essence as the Father**.\n   - **LDS Theology:** Jesus was **a spirit child who became a God** (see *King Follett Discourse*). He is **not eternally uncreated**.\n   - **Problem:** This denies the **eternal preexistence of the Son** (John 17:5) and the **Chalcedonian Definition** (451 AD), which affirms Christ as **\"true God from true God, begotten, not made.\"**\n\n3. **The Trinity as One Being vs. Three Separate Gods**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** The Trinity is **one God in three Persons**, not three separate Gods.\n   - **LDS Theology:** The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are **three distinct Gods** (D&C 130:22; *Abraham 4–5*).\n   - **Problem:** This is **tritheism** (belief in three Gods), which historic Christianity rejects as heretical (cf. *Athanasian Creed*).\n\n#### **B. The Relationship Between Jesus and Lucifer**\n1. **Jesus and Lucifer as \"Spirit Brothers\"**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** Satan is a **created angel** (Ezekiel 28:12–19; Isaiah 14:12–15), **not a literal brother of Christ**. Jesus is **eternally God**, while Satan is a **finite, created being**.\n   - **LDS Theology:** Jesus and Lucifer are **literal spirit siblings**, both children of Heavenly Father.\n   - **Problem:**\n     - This **diminishes Christ’s uniqueness** as the **eternal Son of God** (John 1:18; Hebrews 1:5).\n     - It **elevates Satan to a status he does not possess**—he is not a \"brother\" of Christ in any orthodox sense.\n     - It **contradicts Scripture**, which presents Satan as a **fallen angel** (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 1:6), not a spirit child of God.\n\n2. **The Premortal Council and Christ’s Role**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** The **Incarnation was always God’s plan** (Ephesians 1:4; 1 Peter 1:20), not a **contingent decision** in a premortal council.\n   - **LDS Theology:** The **plan of salvation was debated**, and Jesus was **chosen over Lucifer** in a council.\n   - **Problem:**\n     - This **introduces a competitive, almost democratic process** into the Godhead, which is foreign to orthodox theology.\n     - It **undermines the eternal decree of God** (Acts 2:23; Romans 8:29–30), making salvation dependent on a **premortal vote** rather than God’s sovereign will.\n\n3. **The Nature of Satan’s Rebellion**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** Satan’s sin was **pride and rebellion against God** (Isaiah 14:13–14; Ezekiel 28:17), not a **failed alternative salvation plan**.\n   - **LDS Theology:** Lucifer’s rebellion was **over the method of salvation** (agency vs. forced obedience).\n   - **Problem:**\n     - This **misrepresents Satan’s motives**—Scripture never suggests he wanted to \"save all mankind\" but rather **wanted to be like God** (Isaiah 14:14).\n     - It **implies that Satan had a legitimate concern** about human agency, which orthodox theology rejects as a **deceptive justification for rebellion**.\n\n#### **C. The Implications for Salvation**\n1. **Jesus as Savior vs. Jesus as One of Many Gods**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** Jesus is the **only Savior** (Acts 4:12; 1 Timothy 2:5), **fully God and fully man**, whose sacrifice **atoned for sin once for all** (Hebrews 10:10).\n   - **LDS Theology:** Jesus is **one God among many**, and salvation requires **obedience to LDS ordinances** (baptism, temple rites, etc.), not just faith in Christ (cf. *Articles of Faith*, 3–4).\n   - **Problem:**\n     - This **undermines the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement** (Hebrews 9:28; 1 John 2:2).\n     - It **introduces a works-based salvation** (Ephesians 2:8–9; Galatians 2:16), which historic Christianity rejects.\n\n2. **Theosis (Deification) vs. LDS Exaltation**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity (Eastern Orthodox & some Catholic/Protestant views):** Humans are **transformed into the likeness of God** (2 Peter 1:4) but **do not become Gods in essence**.\n   - **LDS Theology:** Humans can **become Gods** (D&C 132:20; *King Follett Discourse*), ruling their own worlds.\n   - **Problem:**\n     - This **confuses the Creator-creature distinction** (Isaiah 43:10; Romans 1:25).\n     - It **contradicts the uniqueness of Christ’s divinity** (John 1:1, 14; Colossians 2:9).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Areas of Agreement (Despite Differences)**\nWhile the differences are significant, there are **some points of convergence** between LDS and orthodox Christian theology:\n- **Jesus is the Savior of the world** (though LDS theology adds additional requirements).\n- **Satan is a real, fallen being** who opposes God.\n- **Human agency (free will) is important** (though LDS theology ties it to a premortal debate).\n- **Jesus was sinless and performed miracles** (though LDS theology does not affirm His eternal divinity in the same way).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Conclusion: Why the Differences Matter**\nFrom an **orthodox Christian perspective**, the LDS view of Jesus and Lucifer presents **serious theological problems** because:\n1. It **denies the eternal, uncreated nature of Christ** (a core tenet of the Nicene and Chalcedonian Creeds).\n2. It **redefines the Trinity as three separate Gods**, which is **tritheistic** rather than monotheistic.\n3. It **elevates Satan to an improper status** (as a \"brother\" of Christ) while **diminishing Christ’s uniqueness**.\n4. It **introduces a works-based salvation** that contradicts the **sufficiency of Christ’s atonement**.\n5. It **misrepresents Satan’s rebellion** as a disagreement over salvation methods rather than **prideful defiance of God**.\n\nWhile Latter-day Saints **affirm Jesus as Savior**, their **ontological understanding of His nature, His relationship to the Father, and His role in salvation** diverges fundamentally from **historic Christian orthodoxy**. This is why most Christian denominations (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant) **do not recognize LDS baptism as valid** and consider the LDS Church a **non-Christian religion** in terms of its core theology.\n\nHowever, it is important to **engage with respect**, recognizing that Latter-day Saints **love Jesus** (even if their understanding of Him differs) and seek to follow Him. Theological dialogue should be **truthful but charitable**, avoiding caricatures while clearly distinguishing between **orthodox Christian doctrine** and **LDS teachings**.\n\nWould you like further clarification on any specific aspect?",

            "Misrepresentation of the LDS understanding of the Godhead: the answer characterizes LDS doctrine as \"three separate Gods\".

The wording here leans into a common evangelical critique and can misstate official LDS position.",
            "Premortal council description: the response says the premortal council involved a debate between the Father’s plan and Lucifer, and that Jesus was chosen over Lucifer. While LDS sources teach a premortal council with Jesus volunteering and Lucifer opposing, the claim that there was a broad, competitive debate about salvation plans is an interpretive simplification. Some LDS lines emphasize Jesus' willing sacrifice without framing the event as a democratic vote; presenting it as a debated plan is an oversimplification.",
            "King Follett and \"not eternally uncreated\": the claim that LDS Christology entails Jesus \"progressing to godhood\" and that he \"is not eternally uncreated\" is contentious and relies on noncanonical sources (e.g., the King Follett discourse) rather than universally accepted LDS doctrine. LDS teaching about eternal preexistence and the nature of Christ is nuanced and not uniformly summarized as a denial of eternity of the Son; citing King Follett without caution can misrepresent the range of LDS positions.",
            "Idea of \"many gods\" in LDS theology: the response frames LDS belief as potentially polytheistic and contrasts it with orthodox monotheism. While LDS language has sometimes been interpreted that way, official LDS teaching emphasizes unity of the Godhead and exaltation rather than a clear polytheistic system. This is a contested overgeneralization that can mislead readers about the LDS view of godhood and divine beings.",
            "Some doctrinal claims rely on noncanonical sources (e.g., Abraham 3, Moses 4 in the Pearl of Great Price, King Follett) without explicitly distinguishing canonical LDS scripture from later teachings or within-LDS variance. In doctrinal evaluation, it’s helpful to flag what is canonical versus what is later commentary or devotional interpretation."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LDS view of Jesus and Lucifer is accurately summarized in broad strokes (premortal existence, Jesus as Savior, Lucifer’s rebellion, Jesus as the Firstborn). The orthodox critique is also well outlined (eternality of Christ, the Trinity, creator/creature distinctions, and the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement). However, there are some important nuances that were treated too simplistically or framed in a way that can misrepresent LDS doctrine (notably the Godhead as three separate Gods vs. three beings united in purpose; the nature of premortal council discussions; and the doctrinal status of scripture and sources like the King Follett discourse). The evaluation would benefit from clearly distinguishing canonical LDS scriptures (e.g., Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price) from later, noncanonical or devotional writings, and from noting that LDS members and scholars often articulate a more nuanced view of the Godhead and exaltation than the strongest traditional critiques imply. Overall, the analysis is solid in capturing the core orthodox objections and the LDS contrasts, but it includes some overstatements that could mislead readers about current LDS official positions. "

The LDS View of Jesus and Lucifer**\nIn Latter-day Saint theology, **Jesus Christ** and **Lucifer** are **spirit siblings**—both literal offspring of **Heavenly Father (Elohim)** and **Heavenly Mother** in the premortal existence. This relationship is derived from several key LDS scriptures and teachings:\n\n#### **A. Premortal Existence and the Council in Heaven**\n- **Abraham 3:22–28 (Pearl of Great Price)** describes a **premortal council** where God presents His plan for the salvation of humanity. Two key figures emerge:\n  - **Jesus (Jehovah)** volunteers to be the **Savior**, saying, *\"Here am I, send me\"* (Abraham 3:27).\n  - **Lucifer** proposes an alternative plan: *\"I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost\"* (Moses 4:1), but with the condition that he would **take God’s glory** and **deny human agency** (free will).\n- God rejects Lucifer’s plan, leading to his **rebellion** and expulsion from heaven (Revelation 12:7–9; D&C 29:36–37).\n\n#### **B.

The Nature of Jesus in LDS Theology**\n- Unlike orthodox Christianity, which affirms that **Jesus is eternally God (the Second Person of the Trinity)**, LDS theology teaches that:\n  - Jesus was **a spirit child of Heavenly Father** who **progressed to godhood** (see *King Follett Discourse*, Joseph Smith, 1844).\n  - He is **one God among many** (though the supreme God for this world) and is **not eternally uncreated** (cf. *Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith*, p. 370).\n  - The **Trinity is not one Being but three separate Gods** (D&C 130:22; *Abraham 4–5* describes a divine council of gods in creation).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Why This is Problematic from an Orthodox Christian Perspective**\nOrthodox Christianity (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and historic Protestant traditions) holds to **creedal definitions** of God, Christ, and Satan that conflict with the LDS view in several key ways:\n\n#### **A. The Nature of God and Christ**\n1. **Monotheism vs. Henotheism/Polytheism**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** There is **one eternal, uncreated God** (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 43:10; 1 Timothy 2:5), existing as **three co-equal, co-eternal Persons** (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) in one divine essence (*homoousios*, Nicene Creed).\n   - **LDS Theology:** There are **many Gods** (D&C 132:37; *Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith*, p. 370), with Heavenly Father being **one God among many**. Jesus is **a separate God** from the Father, not the same Being.\n   - **Problem:** This contradicts the **Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4)** and the **Nicene Creed**, which define God as **one in essence, not just one in purpose**.\n\n2. **The Eternality of Christ**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** Jesus is **eternally God** (John 1:1; Colossians 1:15–17; Hebrews 1:3), **uncreated**, and **of the same essence as the Father**.\n   - **LDS Theology:** Jesus was **a spirit child who became a God** (see *King Follett Discourse*). He is **not eternally uncreated**.\n   - **Problem:** This denies the **eternal preexistence of the Son** (John 17:5) and the **Chalcedonian Definition** (451 AD), which affirms Christ as **\"true God from true God, begotten, not made.\"**\n\n3. **The Trinity as One Being vs. Three Separate Gods**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** The Trinity is **one God in three Persons**, not three separate Gods.\n   - **LDS Theology:** The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are **three distinct Gods** (D&C 130:22; *Abraham 4–5*).\n   - **Problem:** This is **tritheism** (belief in three Gods), which historic Christianity rejects as heretical (cf. *Athanasian Creed*).\n\n#### **B. The Relationship Between Jesus and Lucifer**\n1. **Jesus and Lucifer as \"Spirit Brothers\"**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** Satan is a **created angel** (Ezekiel 28:12–19; Isaiah 14:12–15), **not a literal brother of Christ**. Jesus is **eternally God**, while Satan is a **finite, created being**.\n   - **LDS Theology:** Jesus and Lucifer are **literal spirit siblings**, both children of Heavenly Father.\n   - **Problem:**\n     - This **diminishes Christ’s uniqueness** as the **eternal Son of God** (John 1:18; Hebrews 1:5).\n     - It **elevates Satan to a status he does not possess**—he is not a \"brother\" of Christ in any orthodox sense.\n     - It **contradicts Scripture**, which presents Satan as a **fallen angel** (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 1:6), not a spirit child of God.\n\n2. **The Premortal Council and Christ’s Role**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** The **Incarnation was always God’s plan** (Ephesians 1:4; 1 Peter 1:20), not a **contingent decision** in a premortal council.\n   - **LDS Theology:** The **plan of salvation was debated**, and Jesus was **chosen over Lucifer** in a council.\n   - **Problem:**\n     - This **introduces a competitive, almost democratic process** into the Godhead, which is foreign to orthodox theology.\n     - It **undermines the eternal decree of God** (Acts 2:23; Romans 8:29–30), making salvation dependent on a **premortal vote** rather than God’s sovereign will.\n\n3. **The Nature of Satan’s Rebellion**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** Satan’s sin was **pride and rebellion against God** (Isaiah 14:13–14; Ezekiel 28:17), not a **failed alternative salvation plan**.\n   - **LDS Theology:** Lucifer’s rebellion was **over the method of salvation** (agency vs. forced obedience).\n   - **Problem:**\n     - This **misrepresents Satan’s motives**—Scripture never suggests he wanted to \"save all mankind\" but rather **wanted to be like God** (Isaiah 14:14).\n     - It **implies that Satan had a legitimate concern** about human agency, which orthodox theology rejects as a **deceptive justification for rebellion**.\n\n#### **C. The Implications for Salvation**\n1. **Jesus as Savior vs. Jesus as One of Many Gods**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity:** Jesus is the **only Savior** (Acts 4:12; 1 Timothy 2:5), **fully God and fully man**, whose sacrifice **atoned for sin once for all** (Hebrews 10:10).\n   - **LDS Theology:** Jesus is **one God among many**, and salvation requires **obedience to LDS ordinances** (baptism, temple rites, etc.), not just faith in Christ (cf. *Articles of Faith*, 3–4).\n   - **Problem:**\n     - This **undermines the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement** (Hebrews 9:28; 1 John 2:2).\n     - It **introduces a works-based salvation** (Ephesians 2:8–9; Galatians 2:16), which historic Christianity rejects.\n\n2. **Theosis (Deification) vs. LDS Exaltation**\n   - **Orthodox Christianity (Eastern Orthodox & some Catholic/Protestant views):** Humans are **transformed into the likeness of God** (2 Peter 1:4) but **do not become Gods in essence**.\n   - **LDS Theology:** Humans can **become Gods** (D&C 132:20; *King Follett Discourse*), ruling their own worlds.\n   - **Problem:**\n     - This **confuses the Creator-creature distinction** (Isaiah 43:10; Romans 1:25).\n     - It **contradicts the uniqueness of Christ’s divinity** (John 1:1, 14; Colossians 2:9).\n\n---\n\n### **3.
