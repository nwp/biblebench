        "output": "Different Christian traditions and Bible scholars answer “Does the Bible contain any errors in what it affirms?” in different ways, largely depending on (1) what counts as an “error” and (2) what the Bible is understood to be “affirming.”\n\n## 1) The main “no” answer: **inerrancy**\nMany evangelical Protestants (and some others) hold to **biblical inerrancy**:  \n- **Claim:** In its original writings, Scripture is **without error in everything it affirms**—not only in theology and morals, but also when it makes factual claims (history, geography, etc.).  \n- **Key nuance:** Inerrantists usually emphasize that “what it affirms” must be read according to **authorial intent and genre**. So poetry, metaphor, hyperbole, approximations, and phenomenological language (“the sun rose”) are not treated as “errors,” because they aren’t intended as scientific precision.\n\n**Common inerrantist clarifications**\n- Copying/translation issues (textual variants) don’t count against inerrancy, because the claim is about the **original autographs**, not every manuscript copy.\n- Apparent discrepancies are often treated as either (a) resolvable with more context, or (b) not real contradictions because the passages are doing different things rhetorically or perspectivally.\n\n## 2) The main “qualified yes/no” answer: **infallibility**\nMany Catholics, Orthodox, and some Protestants prefer **infallibility** language:\n- **Claim:** Scripture is **reliably true and unfailing in what God intends it to teach for salvation/faithfulness**, even if it is not meant to function as an error-free textbook on every empirical detail.\n- Catholics often express this as: Scripture teaches “solidly, faithfully and without error” the truth God wanted put in the sacred writings **for the sake of our salvation** (a classic formulation in Catholic teaching).\n\nOn this view, the Bible can be wholly trustworthy in its divine purpose while still containing:\n- ordinary human ways of reporting,\n- imprecise numbers or chronologies,\n- varying accounts shaped for theological emphasis,\nwithout those being failures of Scripture’s intended message.\n\n## 3) The main “yes” answer: **critical/academic approaches**\nMany biblical scholars (including many Christians) say the Bible contains **real errors** if “error” means any mismatch with modern standards of historiography, science, or internal consistency.\n- **Claim:** The Bible is a library of ancient texts with divine significance (for believers), but it reflects the limitations, perspectives, and conventions of its human authors and communities.\n- On this view, some contradictions or historical difficulties are best explained as the normal result of composition and transmission over time.\n\nExamples often discussed in scholarship (without trying to adjudicate them here) include:\n- differences between parallel accounts (e.g., Kings/Chronicles; Gospel narratives),\n- numerical discrepancies in some lists,\n- questions about chronology or harmonization in certain episodes.\n\n## 4) The key issue is your definition: “errors in what it affirms”\nEven among people who strongly defend the Bible’s truthfulness, the debate turns on **what counts as an “affirmation.”** For example:\n- Is a poetic line “affirming” a literal cosmology, or using imagery?\n- Is an ancient historiographic style “affirming” modern precision, or telling truthful history with ancient conventions?\n- Is a narrative detail essential to the point being taught, or incidental reporting from a particular angle?\n\nSo two people can look at the same passage and disagree not because one “likes the Bible more,” but because they disagree about the passage’s intended claim.\n\n## Bottom line\n- **If you mean classical inerrancy:** the answer is **no** (the Bible is without error in all it affirms, rightly interpreted by genre and intent).\n- **If you mean infallibility/reliability for faith and salvation:** the answer is **no** in that domain, while allowing that not every incidental detail is guaranteed to meet modern standards of precision.\n- **If you mean modern critical standards applied across the board:** many conclude the answer is **yes**, there are errors or contradictions.\n\nIf you tell me your background (e.g., evangelical, Catholic/Orthodox, mainline Protestant, or “not sure”) and what you mean by “error” (historical/scientific contradictions? moral teaching? theological claims?), I can give a more targeted answer and examples.",
