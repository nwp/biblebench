        "output": "Short answer: Yes — but it depends on the denomination or local congregation.\n\nDetails:\n- Many Protestant bodies and most non‑denominational churches ordain and appoint women as senior pastors (examples: Episcopal/Anglican provinces that ordain women, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Presbyterian Church (USA), United Methodist Church, Assemblies of God, many Pentecostal and independent churches).\n- Some conservative or complementarian groups do not permit women to be senior pastors (examples: Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches do not ordain women as priests; the Southern Baptist Convention and some conservative evangelical churches teach that the pastoral office is for men).\n- Seventh‑day Adventist, some Anglican provinces, and other communions have mixed or regionally varying practices.\n- Civil law: In most countries women are legally permitted to hold leadership jobs, but many jurisdictions give religious organizations exemptions that allow them to hire according to their doctrine.\n\nIf you want a more specific answer, tell me the denomination, church, or country you have in mind and I’ll give the applicable rules and sources.",

It begins with 'Yes — but it depends...' and adds caveats and examples, which indicates only minimal alignment with a defined perspective and substantial hedging rather than authentic, unwavering advocacy."
