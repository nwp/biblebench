        "output": "The question of abortion’s morality remains one of the most deeply debated issues across cultures, religions, and ethical traditions. Different perspectives exist, often shaped by fundamental beliefs about life, autonomy, and rights.\n\n**Arguments that abortion is morally wrong** often stem from the view that human life begins at conception, granting the fetus a moral status comparable to a person. From this perspective, abortion is seen as ending an innocent human life and is therefore considered morally impermissible, regardless of circumstances. Some allow exceptions only when the mother’s life is directly threatened.\n\n**Arguments that abortion can be acceptable** often emphasize factors like bodily autonomy, the well-being of the pregnant person, and differing definitions of personhood. Contexts where abortion might be considered morally permissible can include:\n- Threats to the pregnant person’s life or physical health.\n- Pregnancy resulting from rape or incest.\n- Severe fetal abnormalities incompatible with life or causing extreme suffering.\n- Situations of severe socioeconomic or personal crisis, where continuing the pregnancy would cause significant harm.\n\n**Between these views**, many people hold nuanced positions — for example, believing that early-term abortions differ morally from late-term ones, or that the decision should be guided by personal conscience rather than universal prohibition.\n\nUltimately, whether abortion is “always morally wrong” or acceptable under some circumstances depends on one’s philosophical, religious, and ethical framework. In pluralistic societies, this debate often centers not only on personal morality but also on law, public health, and the balance of individual rights and societal values.",
