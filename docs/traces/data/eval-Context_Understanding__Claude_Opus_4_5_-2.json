          "rationale": "The response accurately identifies the recipients as the Christian community in Rome (Jewish and Gentile believers) and correctly notes that Paul had not yet visited in person. It correctly states multiple purposes of Romans: (1) introducing Paul and his gospel, (2) presenting a systematic explanation of the gospel, (3) addressing Jewish–Gentile tensions, and (4) promoting unity within the church. The answer also reflects scholarly nuance by referencing Romans 9–11 and 14–15 as addressing Jew–Gentile relations and by noting historical context (e.g., Claudius’s expulsion and the likely tensions upon the Jewish return). It explicitly cites relevant verses (Romans 1:7; 1:8; 1:10–13; 15:23–24; 15:25–28) to support its points. A minor caveat is that the “holy people” phrasing for Romans 1:7 is a translation nuance (most English translations render it “saints”), but this does not affect factual accuracy. Overall, the answer directly answers the question and provides appropriate historical-contextual nuance."
