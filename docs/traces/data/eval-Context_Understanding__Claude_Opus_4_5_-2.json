          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer reflects a solid and widely accepted reading of Romans: the addressee is the Christian community in Rome, a church Paul had not yet visited, consisting of Jewish and Gentile believers. The stated purposes align with biblical data: (1) introducing Paul and his gospel before his planned visit (Romans 15:23-29; 15:28-29), (2) presenting a systematic explanation of the gospel and justification by faith (Romans 1–5; 3–4), (3) addressing Jew–Gentile tensions within the congregation (Romans 9–11; 14–15 on how Gentiles and Jews relate within the one people of God), and (4) soliciting support for his westward missionary plan to Spain and for his travel to Rome (Romans 15:24, 28–32). These points are doctrinally orthodox (emphasizing justification by faith and the inclusion of Jew and Gentile) and biblically grounded. While the answer could further elaborate on Romans’ broader themes (e.g., the law, Israel’s status, and God’s faithfulness to Israel) for fuller nuance, the core evaluation of to whom and why Romans was written is accurate and well-captured."
