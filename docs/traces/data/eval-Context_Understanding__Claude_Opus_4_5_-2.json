This served as something of a theological \"letter of introduction.\"\n\n### 2. **To Seek Support for His Spanish Mission**\nPaul hoped Rome would become a base of support for his planned missionary journey to Spain (Rom. 15:23-24, 28). He needed their partnership—both prayerful and material.\n\n### 3. **To Address Jewish-Gentile Tensions**\nA significant portion of the letter (especially chapters 9-11 and 14-15) addresses the relationship between Jews and Gentiles in God's redemptive plan, likely reflecting real tensions within the Roman congregation—possibly exacerbated after Jewish Christians returned following their expulsion under Claudius (Acts 18:2).",

It accurately summarizes Paul’s purposes (gospel introduction, seeking support for a future mission, addressing Jewish–Gentile tensions) and situates the context with Claudius’s expulsion (Acts 18:2) and Pentecost (Acts 2:10). The main point needing nuance is the demographic claim about Gentile vs Jewish composition, which is not definitively established in the text; otherwise, the response aligns with standard historical-critical views."
