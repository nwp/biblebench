    "output": "### Primary Audience of the Sermon on the Mount\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount, as recorded in the Gospel of Matthew (chapters 5–7), is one of Jesus' most extensive teachings in the New Testament, covering topics like the Beatitudes, ethical living, prayer, and the nature of the kingdom of God. Based on the biblical text and historical context, here's a clear breakdown of its primary audience:\n\n#### In the Biblical Narrative\n- **Primary Audience: Jesus' Disciples**  \n  The sermon is explicitly directed toward Jesus' closest followers, often referred to as his \"disciples.\" Matthew 5:1–2 describes the setting: \"Seeing the crowds, he [Jesus] went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying...\" This indicates that Jesus positioned himself to teach his inner circle intimately, using direct address like \"you\" (e.g., \"Blessed are you...\" in the Beatitudes, or instructions on prayer and ethics). The teachings emphasize how disciples should live as part of God's kingdom, contrasting with broader religious practices of the time (e.g., Pharisaic legalism).\n\n- **Secondary Presence: The Crowds**  \n  While the disciples are the focus, a larger crowd is present and overhears the teaching. Matthew 7:28–29 notes that \"when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.\" This suggests the sermon had a ripple effect, inspiring awe among the multitudes who followed Jesus out of curiosity or spiritual interest (as mentioned in Matthew 4:25, describing \"great crowds\" from Galilee, Jerusalem, and beyond). However, the content is not primarily tailored to the crowds but to those committed to following Jesus.\n\nThis structure reflects a common ancient Near Eastern teaching style, where a teacher (like a rabbi) would sit to instruct students, with others potentially listening in. Historically, this event is set during Jesus' Galilean ministry (around 28–30 CE), amid growing public interest in his message, healings, and miracles.\n\n#### Scholarly Perspectives\n- **Traditional/Majority View**: Most biblical scholars, including conservative and evangelical traditions, view the disciples as the primary audience, with the sermon serving as a foundational \"discipleship manual\" for Jesus' followers. This aligns with Matthew's overall emphasis on Jesus as the fulfillment of Jewish law and prophecy, teaching a \"higher righteousness\" (Matthew 5:20) for his committed adherents.\n  \n- **Alternative Perspectives**: Some modern scholars (e.g., in historical-critical approaches) suggest the Sermon on the Mount may be a compilation of Jesus' sayings edited by Matthew's author(s) for a later Christian community, rather than a single historical event. In this view, the \"primary audience\" could extend to the Gospel's original readers—likely Jewish Christians in the late 1st century CE (around 80–90 CE), facing tensions with mainstream Judaism post the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. A parallel but shorter version, the Sermon on the Plain in Luke 6:17–49, addresses a similar mixed audience but emphasizes the plain rather than a mount, leading some to debate if these represent the same event or distinct traditions. However, there is broad consensus that the Matthean version prioritizes instruction for disciples.\n\nIn summary, within the story, the Sermon on the Mount was primarily for Jesus' disciples as a guide for kingdom living, while also impacting the surrounding crowds. If you're interested in specific themes, historical parallels, or comparisons with Luke's account, let me know for more details!",

It cites key biblical texts (Matt 5:1–2; 7:28–29) and situates the setting in the Galilean ministry. It notes the common scholarly view that the Sermon is primarily for disciples, while acknowledging alternative historical-critical perspectives that frame the material as Matthew’s edited compilation for a Christian community, and it mentions Luke's parallel as related tradition. This provides appropriate nuance about authorship and audience without overstating certainty. The response is directly relevant to the question and covers the main points; minor interpretive variations are appropriately flagged."
