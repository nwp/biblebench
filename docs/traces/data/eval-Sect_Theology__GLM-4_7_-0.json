    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "This teaching, often referred to as the \"Lorenzo Snow couplet,\" is one of the most distinct and well-known doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). It encapsulates the LDS concepts of **Eternal Progression** and **Exaltation**.\n\nTo answer your question directly: **No, this teaching is not consistent with orthodox Christian theology.** While there are superficial similarities in vocabulary—specifically regarding the destiny of believers—there is a fundamental and irreconcilable difference regarding the nature of God and the distinction between the Creator and the created.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of the relationship between this LDS teaching and historic, orthodox Christian doctrine (encompassing Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism).\n\n### 1. Analysis of \"As man now is, God once was\"\n\nThe first half of the couplet posits that God the Father was once a mortal man, subject to death and sin, who progressed to become God. This implies that God is of the same \"species\" or nature as humanity, simply at a more advanced stage of development.\n\n**Orthodox Christian View:**\nHistoric Christianity affirms that God is **Uncreated** (*Aseity*).\n*   **Creator/Creature Distinction:** Orthodoxy teaches an infinite ontological chasm between the Creator and the creature. God is the *Uncreated* source of all things; humans are created *ex nihilo* (out of nothing).\n*   **Immutability:** Orthodox doctrine holds that God does not change (Malachi 3:6; James 1:17; Psalm 102:26-27). God has always been God; He did not \"graduate\" to divinity.\n*   **Eternality:** The Nicene Creed states that God is \"eternally begotten, not made.\" In orthodox theology, God has no beginning and no end. To say that God was once a man implies a beginning to His divinity, which orthodoxy rejects as a theological error (specifically, a form of *theological anthropomorphism* or *polytheism*).\n\n**The Departure:**\nThe assertion that \"God was once a man\" contradicts the orthodox definition of God as the *Uncreated* One. It reduces God to a derivative being who is contingent upon a prior reality or system, rather than the self-existent Ground of Being.\n\n### 2. Analysis of \"As God now is, man may become\"\n\nThe second half of the couplet teaches that humans have the potential to become gods in the fullest sense—to procreate spirit children, rule over worlds, and possess the exact same nature and power as God the Father.\n\n**Orthodox Christian View:**\nThis is where confusion often arises, because historic Christianity—particularly in the Eastern Orthodox tradition but also in Catholic and Protestant soteriology—speaks of **Theosis** (or *Deification*).\n*   **Biblical Basis:** St. Peter refers to believers becoming \"partakers of the divine nature\" (2 Peter 1:4), and St. Athanasius famously said, \"He became human so that we might become divine.\"\n*   **Distinction by Nature:** However, orthodox theology is careful to distinguish between **essence** (*ousia*) and **energy** (*energeia*) or grace.\n    *   In orthodoxy, humans can become like God by grace. We reflect His glory, His holiness, and His immortality. We are united to Him.\n    *   We **do not** become God by nature. We never become the *Uncreated Creator*. We do not attain a separate godhood where we rival or replace the One True God. There is only one Who Is God by nature (YHWH).\n\n**The Departure:**\nWhile orthodox Christianity believes humans are destined for glorious transformation and union with God, it rejects the idea that humans will literally become a separate \"God\" (with a capital G) or that we will essentially become the same species as God. The LDS teaching suggests a functional polytheism (many gods) and a form of *evolutionary divinity* that is absent from the Nicene tradition.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n\n| Feature | LDS Teaching (Snow Couplet) | Orthodox Christian Theology |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Nature of God** | Once a man; exalted being; physical. | Spirit (though incarnate in Jesus); Uncreated; Creator. |\n| **Humanity's Potential** | To become a God *by nature* (creating, ruling). | To become like God *by grace* (sanctified, glorified). |\n| **The Goal** | **Exaltation:** Equality with the Father in essence and power. | **Salvation/Theosis:** Restoration of the image of God and eternal union with Him. |\n| **Number of Gods** | Open-ended (Plurality of Gods/Henotheism). | Strict Monotheism (One Divine Nature/Trinity). |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile both traditions agree that human potential is vast and that the ultimate destiny of believers is intimately tied to the divine, the **mechanics and definitions** are entirely different.\n\nThe teaching \"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become\" represents a radical departure from historic Christianity because it denies the **Creator/Creature distinction**. It posits an eternal regression of gods (an infinite past of gods begetting gods), which eliminates the need for a singular, Uncreated Creator. For orthodox Christianity, God is the \"Alpha and Omega,\" the uncaused cause, who alone is God by nature, and who invites humans into a relationship of adoption, not promotion to independent deity.",

            "Use of the term 'henotheism' to describe LDS belief is contested; scholars vary in labeling the Mormon view of multiple gods, and some would describe it more as polytheism or eternal progression rather than a strict henotheism.",
            "Statements about LDS beliefs (e.g., 'spirit children,' 'worlds' to govern, or becoming by nature a God) reflect common summaries but are simplified and not uniformly accepted within LDS thought across all periods and leaders; nuance exists in how exaltation and deification are framed historically and presently.",
            "The discussion of 'as man now is, God once was' could overstate the implications by not distinguishing between Mormon soteriological emphasis on exaltation and the broader spectrum of Christian theological responses to divine immutability and creatio ex nihilo."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies the Creator/creature distinction, immutability, and eternality as central to orthodox theology and correctly treats deification (theosis) as participation in divine life by grace rather than a literal, natural becoming of God. It also accurately notes that orthodox Christianity rejects the LDS claim of God and humanity sharing a divine nature in the sense of independent godhood. The major strengths lie in affirming biblical support for divine transcendence, theosis as grace-filled transformation, and the distinction between Creator and created. The main areas for improvement are that some doctrinal summaries (especially the table) simplify the Triune God and LDS theological vocabulary, and the use of terms like 'henotheism' can be contested or imprecise depending on interpretive lens. The analysis would be strengthened by clarifying the orthodox understanding of the Trinity (one God in three persons) and by more carefully mapping LDS doctrines to specific, citable doctrines or statements from LDS sources."
