    "input": "What is the hypostatic union in relation to Jesus Christ?",
    "expected": "The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is one person with two complete and distinct natures: fully God and fully human. These two natures are united without mixture, confusion, separation, or division. Jesus is not partly God and partly human, but wholly God and wholly human simultaneously.",
    "output": "The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is both fully divine and fully human, united in one divine person. In short: one Person, two complete natures.\n\nKey elements explained simply\n- Hypostasis (person) vs. physis (nature): In Christian theology, a “hypostasis” is a definite, subsisting being or person. A “physis” is a nature with its own properties (divine nature, human nature). The doctrine says: in the one Lord Jesus Christ there is one hypostasis (the divine Son) with two complete natures.\n- The two natures are full and distinct: Jesus possesses a fully divine nature (the eternal Son, the second person of the Trinity) and a fully human nature (true humanity—body and, in orthodox teaching, a true human soul). Each nature retains its own properties.\n- They are united in the one person: The divine and human natures are not two separate persons; they are united in the single person of the Son. He is not a hybrid or a mixture of natures; rather, God the Son assumed humanity in a real, complete way and now exists as the God-man, Jesus Christ.\n- The union is “without confusion, without change, without division, without separation” (Chalcedonian formulation): This is the classic way the early church guarded against various heresies. It means the natures do not lose their distinct properties (divinity stays divine, humanity stays human), and there is not a second person added to Jesus; there is one person with two natures.\n\nBiblical basis (briefly)\n- John 1:14: “The Word became flesh” — the eternal Word (divine Son) took on human nature.\n- Colossians 2:9: “In Christ all the fullness of the Deity dwells in bodily form” — the divine nature is present in Jesus.\n- Philippians 2:6–8: the Son’s form of God and his taking the form of a servant, becoming obedient to death — shows both divine preexistence and genuine humanity in one Person.\n- Hebrews 2:14–17: the Son partook of flesh and blood to save humanity, yet remains the compassionate high priest of one who is human.\n- Luke 2:52 and other Gospel passages: Jesus grows in wisdom and stature, experiences human life, yet remains the eternal Son.\n\nHistorical formulation\n- The term “hypostatic union” comes largely from the teaching of the early ecumenical councils, most notably the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD). Their definition affirms “two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation,” in the one and only person, the Son of God made man.\n- This doctrine was developed to affirm the biblical claim that Jesus is truly God and truly human, while safeguarding against views that would make him only a divine being in disguise or merely a human being who was adopted by God.\n\nWhy this matters\n- Soteriology (the doctrine of salvation): If Jesus were not fully divine, he could not bear the weight of infinite divine justice or reveal God fully. If he were not truly human, he could not represent humanity, bear humanity’s curse, and be a faithful substitute for humans. The hypostatic union makes the atonement truly both God’s work and humanity’s representative work.\n- Revelation and worship: In Jesus, God reveals himself in a comprehensible way (as a human being) while also being the eternal God. Christians worship Jesus as Lord who is God, yet also recognize him as a human being who prayed, learned, suffered, and died.\n- Ethics and miracle-working: Christ’s divine nature enables the divine miracles and authoritative teaching; his human nature grounds his genuine temptations, sufferings, and experiences as a real human being.\n\nCommon questions and clarifications\n- Do two natures mean two persons? No. The hypostatic union affirms one persoon (one hypostasis) with two natures. This distinguishes it from 教 Nestorianism, which proposed two persons.\n- Do the two natures conflict? The aim of the doctrine is that they remain distinct yet perfectly united in the one person. The divine nature does not cease to be divine, and the human nature remains truly human.\n- Do we have to explain wills or operations? The traditional Chalcedonian formula does not explicitly spell out how many wills or operations Jesus had; many orthodox traditions affirm that the divine and human natures each act in accord with their own properties, united in the one person. This is a nuanced area sometimes discussed under dyotheletism (two wills) vs. monothelitism (one will); classical Chalcedon generally supports the integrity of both natures within one person.\n\nIn sum\nThe hypostatic union says: in Jesus Christ there is one person—God the Son)—who assumed a complete human nature. He is truly God and truly man, with the divine and the human natures remaining distinct but inseparably united in the one person of Jesus. This doctrine is grounded in Scripture and codified in the early church to safeguard the fullness of Jesus’ deity and humanity for salvation, revelation, and worship.",

          "rationale": "The response accurately describes the hypostatic union: Jesus is one person (the divine Son) with two complete natures (fully divine and fully human), united without confusion, change, division, or separation. It adopts the standard Chalcedonian formulation and explains the hypostasis (person) vs. physis (nature), with each nature retaining its properties. It rightly emphasizes that the natures are united in one person, not two persons (avoiding Nestorianism), and it cites key biblical texts commonly used to support the doctrine (John 1:14; Colossians 2:9; Philippians 2:6–8; Hebrews 2:14–17; Luke 2:52). The historical and doctrinal context (Chalcedon, two natures in one person) is accurately presented and the practical implications for salvation, revelation, and worship are well articulated. A minor nuanced discussion (e.g., the precise handling of wills in Christ—dyotheletism vs monothelitism) is briefly touched and could be elaborated, but the core statements align well with orthodox Christian teaching."
