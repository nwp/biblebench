    "expected": "Jesus' disciples and the crowds who followed him",
    "output": "The primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount, as presented in the Gospel of Matthew (chapters 5–7), consisted of two distinct groups present at the event: **Jesus' disciples** and the **multitudes (crowds)**.\n\nHowever, scholarly analysis distinguishes between the immediate historical audience and the theological audience intended by the author of the Gospel. Here is a detailed breakdown of the audience based on historical context and biblical scholarship.\n\n### 1. The Immediate Historical Audience\nAccording to the narrative in Matthew 5:1–2, Jesus went up a mountainside, sat down, and his disciples came to him. The text states, \"He opened his mouth and taught *them*.\"\n\n*   **The Disciples (The Inner Circle):**\n    Grammatically and contextually, the specific focus of the sermon is on the disciples. While the crowds were present, the Sermon on the Mount functions as a sort of \"ordination address\" or \"inauguration speech\" for the Kingdom of God. The ethical demands contained within the sermon (e.g., the Beatitudes, the call to be \"salt and light,\" and the high standards of righteousness in Matthew 5–7) are requirements specifically laid upon those who have chosen to follow Jesus.\n*   **The Multitudes (The Outer Circle):**\n    Matthew 4:25 notes that \"great crowds\" followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan. Matthew 7:28 concludes the sermon by stating, \"the crowds were astonished at his teaching.\" Therefore, the disciples were not the only ones listening; the sermon was delivered publicly, serving as a proclamation and a challenge to the nation of Israel at large.\n\n### 2. The Demographic Profile\nThe audience was primarily **Jewish**.\n*   **Geography:** The event takes place in Galilee, a northern region of Israel with a heavy Jewish population but significant Gentile influence (often referred to as \"Galilee of the Gentiles\").\n*   **Cultural Context:** The sermon is deeply rooted in Jewish scripture and tradition. Jesus repeatedly references the Law (Torah), the Prophets, and Jewish religious practices (almsgiving, prayer, and fasting). He argues not for the abolition of the Law, but for its fulfillment. The audience would have understood his arguments within the framework of First Century Judaism, likely familiar with the teachings of the Pharisees and Scribes, whom Jesus critiques indirectly throughout the sermon.\n\n### 3. The Literary Audience (The Author of Matthew)\nFrom a scholarly perspective regarding the composition of the Gospel, the \"primary audience\" shifts from the people on the mountain to the community for which the Gospel of Matthew was written.\n\n*   **The Matthean Community:** Most scholars date the Gospel of Matthew to roughly AD 80–90. The immediate audience was likely a community of Jewish Christians (Jewish believers in Jesus) perhaps living in Antioch or Syria.\n*   **Context of the Community:** This community was navigating the tension between their Jewish heritage and their faith in Jesus as the Messiah. They were likely facing conflict with non-Christian Jewish leadership (Pharisaic Judaism) regarding the interpretation of the Law.\n*   **Purpose:** The author structures the Sermon on the Mount to instruct this community on how to live as the true people of God (\"the new Israel\") in the interim period before the Kingdom's consummation. The sermon serves as a guide for church discipline and communal identity.\n\n### Summary\n*   **Narrative Audience:** The disciples (primary targets) and the Jewish crowds of Galilee (witnesses).\n*   **Demographics:** Jewish subjects living under Roman occupation, familiar with the Hebrew Scriptures.\n*   **Intended Literary Audience:** The early Christian community (specifically Jewish Christians) for whom Matthew wrote his Gospel, defining the ethics and identity of the followers of Jesus.",

          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies the two immediate groups (disciples and crowds) and separates the immediate historical-audience from the gospel’s literary-audience. It reasonably notes that the Matthean community is a key literary-audience and that dating and context are debated among scholars. Minor caveats include: (1) the 'ordination address' framing is interpretive; (2) explicit textual naming of Galilee as the sermon location is not stated in Matthew 5–7 (scholars often place it in Galilee, but the text does not explicitly name the location); (3) while the Matthean audience is commonly described as Jewish Christians, some scholarship emphasizes Gentile participation or readers beyond a purely Jewish milieu. Overall, the answer is accurate, thorough, and appropriately nuanced for the question.)"
