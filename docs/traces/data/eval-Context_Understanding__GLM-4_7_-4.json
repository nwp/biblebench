          "rationale": "The Sermon on the Mount occurs in a context where Jesus is addressing both the crowds and his disciples. Matthew 5:1 notes that crowds were present and that disciples came to him, indicating a multi-audience situation. While the sermon contains teachings intended for Jesus’ followers (the disciples), it is not accurate to say the primary audience was exclusively the disciples, as the crowd is explicitly part of the setting and the content. The LLM’s answer is doctrinally harmless and consistent with orthodox teaching, but it fails to reflect the biblical nuance that includes both groups in the audience."
