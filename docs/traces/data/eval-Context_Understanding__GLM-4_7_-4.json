The Immediate Recipients: The Disciples**\nMatthew’s Gospel makes a clear distinction between the \"crowds\" who followed Jesus and the smaller group of disciples to whom the specific instruction was directed. Matthew 5:1 states, *\"Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them.\"*\n*   **The Meaning:** The Sermon was essentially a \"commissioning\" or \"ordination\" address. It was meant to define the values and lifestyle of those who would follow Him closely.\n*   **The Twelve:** While the text uses the broader term \"disciples\" (which can include a larger group of followers), the context of the surrounding chapters (such as the selection of the Twelve Apostles in Matthew 10) suggests that the core leadership was the focus of this intensive training.\n\n**2. The Secondary Audience: The Crowds**\nWhile the teaching was directed inwardly at the disciples, it was delivered publicly.\n*   **Presence:** Matthew 7:28 notes that *\"the crowds were amazed at his teaching\"* when he finished. This indicates they were present and listening.\n*   **Function:** The sermon served as a proclamation to the wider Jewish public, revealing the true nature of the Kingdom of Heaven and distinguishing Jesus’ authority from that of the religious leaders of the time.\n\n**3. Historical and Religious Context**\n*   **Jewish Audience:** Both the disciples and the crowds were Jewish. Consequently, the Sermon assumes a knowledge of the Hebrew Scriptures (the Old Testament) and First Century Judaism. Jesus frequently references the Law of Moses and Jewish traditions to reinterpret them.\n*   **The Kingdom of Heaven:** A key scholarly understanding is that the audience was anticipating a political Messiah. Jesus redirects their focus to a spiritual kingdom, explaining that citizenship in this Kingdom requires a righteousness that \"surpasses that of the Pharisees and teachers of the law\" (Matthew 5:20).\n\n**Summary**\nWhile the Sermon on the Mount was heard by the multitudes, the primary audience was the disciples. It was intended as an instruction manual for the citizens of the Kingdom of God, distinguishing the true follower of Christ from the nominal adherent or the religious establishment.",

            "The line about the audience expecting a political Messiah is a generalization; first-century Jewish expectations varied, and the Sermon presents a spiritual/ethical kingdom rather than simply reframing political hopes; a note about the diversity of eschatological expectations would add nuance."

          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies the immediate recipients (disciples) and acknowledges the crowds present, notes the public setting, and situates the sermon within Jewish/Hebraic context and the Kingdom of Heaven theme. It also correctly notes that the disciples represent a broader 'disciples' category. However, it relies on a specific inference that the Twelve were the primary audience (not explicitly stated in Matt 5:1), and it characterizes the sermon as a 'commissioning' address, which is interpretive. It also presents the political Messiah expectation as a key, broadly held scholarly view without acknowledging the diversity of First Temple/Second Temple Jewish expectations. Overall, the core facts are sound, with minor interpretive and nuanced caveats that could be clarified."
