          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns well with the biblical portrayal of Revelation: it emphasizes God’s sovereignty and Christ’s ultimate victory over evil, and it highlights the book’s pastoral aim to encourage persecuted believers to persevere (e.g., guidance to remain faithful in Rev 2–3; the victorious Christ in Rev 19–20). These elements are central to Revelation’s purpose and are biblically grounded. However, the response omits explicit mention of the book’s apocalyptic visions (the visionary, symbolic nature of the text) and the explicit future return of Christ, which are commonly highlighted in traditional summaries of Revelation’s purpose. The core message—perseverance in faith in light of God’s sovereign victory—is present, but the nuance regarding visions and the eschatological return could be more explicit. Overall, it is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded with minor gaps in nuance."
