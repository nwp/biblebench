    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",

            "The description of LDS theology as 'three separate divine beings, united in purpose but distinct in substance' is a rough over-simplification and risks misrepresenting Mormon ontology (they emphasize three distinct personages rather than a single divine essence, and the phrase 'distinct in substance' echoes classical tritheism rather than LDS teaching).",
            "The claim 'This represents a form of modalism or tritheism depending on interpretation' is inaccurate about LDS doctrine. LDS theology generally rejects modalism and describes the Godhead as three distinct beings united in purpose, not as modes of one Person in three modes.",
            "The assertion 'Christ is God's Son, created spiritually before the world' is misleading. In LDS belief, Jesus is the Only Begotten Son in the flesh and existed as a pre-mortal spirit; mainstream LDS sources do not teach that He was 'created spiritually before the world' in the sense implied by the line.",
            "Some phrases imply ontological subordination (e.g., 'subordinate to the Father in a way classical theology rejects'), which is a contested and nuanced topic. In classical orthodoxy, ontological equality within the Trinity is maintained; LDS economic subordination is a different category and not the same as classical subordinationism.",
            "The answer would benefit from explicit biblical citations or direct scriptural grounding (e.g., Matt 28:19; John 1:1; Colossians 1:15–20) to anchor statements about the Trinity, Christology, and the Holy Spirit rather than relying on broader doctrinal summaries."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response captures a key distinction (historic Trinitarian orthodoxy vs. LDS beliefs) and notes some common areas of agreement. However, it contains several doctrinal inaccuracies or rough characterizations (especially regarding the nature of the Godhead in LDS theology and Christology) and lacks explicit scriptural grounding. It also portrays LDS positions in a way that could be read as modalism or as a form of subordinationism, both of which require careful proportional clarification. Overall, it’s mostly aligned with the expected assessment but needs correction of several specifics and better scriptural support for a solid theological evaluation."
