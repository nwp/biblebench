    "input": "Oneness Pentecostals teach that God is one person who manifests himself in three different modes or roles - sometimes as Father, sometimes as Son, sometimes as Holy Spirit - rather than three distinct persons. Is this orthodox?",
    "expected": "No, this is the ancient heresy of modalism (also called Sabellianism), which was condemned by the early church. Orthodox Christianity teaches that God is one being eternally existing as three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Biblical evidence for their simultaneous distinct existence includes Jesus' baptism (Matthew 3:16-17) where the Son is baptized, the Spirit descends, and the Father speaks - all at the same time. Jesus prays to the Father (John 17), showing personal relationship between persons. The apostolic blessing (2 Corinthians 13:14) distinguishes three persons. Modalism was rejected because it cannot account for the relationships within the Godhead and makes Jesus' prayers to the Father nonsensical.",
    "output": "**Short answer:**  \nNo.  In the context of the historic, ecumenical creeds and the theological consensus that has been “orthodox” since the first formal church councils, Oneness (or modal) theology is *not* considered orthodox Christian doctrine.  It represents a non‑trinitarian position that rejects the distinct persons of the Trinity while retaining the idea of one divine essence.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The orthodox picture of God (Trinitarianism)\n\n| Source | Key points |\n|--------|------------|\n| **The Nicene Creed (325 CE)** | “We believe in one God, the Father... we believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only Son of God... we believe in one Holy Spirit” |\n| **The Athanasian Creed (a later formulation, but widely cited)** | “The Godhead is one in all, yet each Person is individually a Person.  This is not a simple multiplicity of the same Person, nor a single Person which is the Godhead in truth.” |\n| **Biblical support** | *Matth. 28:19* – “Baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”  *John 1:1‑14* – the Word “was God” and “became flesh.”  *1 Cor. 12:4‑6* – “there are kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit, different ministries.”  *John 14:16‑17* – the Son will send the Father‑related Spirit.  *Eph. 4:4‑6* – “united in one Spirit.” |\n\n- **Essence–Person distinction** – God has one divine essence, but three divine Persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit).  \n- **Co‑existence & equality** – each Person is fully God, co‑existent, co‑eternal, and equally distinct.  \n\nThese doctrines were affirmed at the First Council of Nicaea (325 CE), the Council of Constantinople (381 CE), and the Council of Ephesus (431 CE).  The doctrine has been considered *orthodox* by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and most mainline Protestant churches.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Oneness (modal) theology in brief\n\n| Element | What Oneness says |\n|---------|--------------------|\n| **One Person of God** | God is one person who “manifests” in different modes or roles. |\n| **Father, Son, Holy Spirit** | These are *titles* or *manifestations* of that single person; they are not distinct Persons. |\n| **Biblical motivation** | Reference to the “unity” of Jesus, the singularity of God in *John 1* and *Heb. 1:* “I am the Father” (John 5:18). |\n| **Practice** | “Only Jesus is necessary for salvation”; “the Father is found in the Son” (John 1:18). |\n\nOneness/Pentecostal theologians usually trace their view to the **Sabellian** (or *Modalistic*) tradition, which is named after the early heresiarch *Sabellius* (c. 3rd C E).  This view was explicitly condemned as *Sabellianism* at the **Council of Nicaea** and again at the **Council of Constantinople** when judges of the defining creeds spoke of a *composite God*.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Why Oneness is not orthodox\n\n| Criterion | What the orthodox faith holds | How Oneness diverges |\n|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Distinctness of Persons** | Three Persons *in one essence* (see Nicene & Athanasian Creeds). | Argues there are *no* distinct Persons; Father, Son, & Spirit are modes of one Person. |\n| **Scriptural language** | Scripture explicitly speaks of a *triple* nature: “Fath­­er, Son, and Holy Spirit” (e.g., 1 Cor. 12:4‑6; John 14:16‑17). | Emphasises that the names “Father” and “Son” are used *interchangeably* for Jesus; the Holy Spirit is a “mode” or “function” of the same Person. |\n| **Christology** | Jesus is fully the Son of God by nature and identity, and is *distinct* from the Father (John 1:18; 1 Cor. 15:3‑8). | Jesus is *not* a distinct Person from the Father but the *manifestation* of the Father; hence, the term *Son* is only a relational term. |\n| **Historical Consensus** | Uniform Emphasis on Trinitarianism since the Council of Nicaea onward, widely accepted (Catholic, Orthodox, most Protestants). | Rejects the core distinctness the Councils insisted upon; thus it is a *non‑trinitarian* belief. |\n\nBecause it denies the *three distinct Persons* while claiming “God is one,” Oneness theology falls into the category of *non‑trinitarianism* or *modalism*.  Most mainstream Christian bodies list it as a theological error—or a **heresy**—since it diverges from the creeds that define “orthodoxy.”\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Theological points of posterity\n\n| Others' view | Key idea | Status in orthodox circles |\n|--------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| **Modalism** (Sabellianism) | Same as Oneness: one Person who *modes* as father, son, spirit. | Heresy in church history. |\n| **Unitarianism** | Only one person, no Trinity. | Unitarian churches consider themselves Christian, but remain outside Trinitarian orthodoxy. |\n| **High Church (Catholic/Eastern)** | Trinitarian in essence & institution. | Fully consistent with orthodoxy. |\n| **Protestant Evangelical** | Trinitarian or, in very few cases, a variant called “Non‑Trinitarian Evangelicalism.” | Most evangelical churches also keep trinitarian doctrine. |\n\nThe *Oneness* position is therefore **not historic orthodoxy** but a **modern, non‑trinitarian** theological tradition.  It has, however, gained a modest following among certain Pentecostal and charismatic groups that emphasize the unity of God’s manifested modes.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Bottom line\n\n- **Orthodox** Christian theology (catholic, ortho‑... etc.) maintains the *Trinitarian* formulation: one divine essence in three co‑existent, co‑equal Persons.  \n- **Oneness** theology, by defining those persons as modes of one Person, *rejects* the very concept of distinct Persons that this doctrine affirms.  \n- Consequently, Oneness Pentecostal teaching does **not** align with historic Christian orthodoxy and is classified as a non‑trinitarian doctrine, often labeled as **modalism** or **Sabellianism** in theological discourse.\n\nIt is always encouraging to discuss these differences respectfully, recognizing that people’s beliefs carry deep personal and communal meaning, even when the doctrinal claims differ from historical consensus.",

            "Historical detail: Ephesus is cited as a Trinity-defining council, but the Nicene (325) and Constantinople (381) creeds are the primary canonical sources for Trinitarian orthodoxy; Ephesus (431) addressed Christology regarding Mary and the two natures of Christ rather than redefining the Trinity."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately identifies Oneness/modalism as non‑trinitarian and explains why traditional orthodoxy affirms Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three distinct Persons within one divine essence. It correctly cites major creedal data and Scripture supports for the Trinity and notes the historical consensus. The main weakness is a factual slip regarding a scriptural quotation (John 5:18 vs. Hebrews 1) which undermines biblical grounding in one place. It also overstates Ephesus’s role in defining the Trinity, though that council contributed to the broader Christological framework. Overall, the answer is solid but should correct the cited scripture reference and amend the historical detail for full accuracy."
