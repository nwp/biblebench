    "expected": "To encourage persecuted Christians with visions of God's ultimate victory and the return of Christ",
    "output": "Short answer\nThe book of Revelation was written to reveal the sovereignty and redemptive plan of God in Jesus Christ, to encourage and strengthen Christians under persecution, and to call them to faithful witness and worship. It aims to show that evil will be judged, that God’s kingdom will prevail, and that believers should remain faithful until the end.\n\nKey points for understanding its purpose\n- Core aim: Unveil Jesus as exalted Lord who conquers evil and will bring history to its rightful conclusion; encourage perseverance and faithful witness in the face of oppression.\n- Pastoral purpose: Comfort exhausted churches, urge repentance where needed, and exhort believers to resist compromise with pagan power (notably the imperial cult in the late first century).\n- Theological purpose: Affirm theodicy (God’s justice), the reality of spiritual warfare, and the eventual restoration of all things—new heaven and new earth, with worship of God and the Lamb.\n- Liturgical and ethical purpose: Promote true worship, purity, steadfastness, and ethical conduct in light of the coming kingdom.\n- Eschatological frame: The message operates on an “already/not yet” pattern—Christ has won the decisive victory, but the full consummation awaits future fulfillment.\n\nTraditional authorship and dating (with scholarly options)\n- Traditional view: John the Apostle (the “beloved disciple”) wrote Revelation while in exile on Patmos, probably in the 90s CE (often dated around 95 CE). This view connects Revelation to the Johannine corpus’ broader theology (in continuity with the Gospel of John and the Epistles).\n- Alternative views: Some scholars appeal to a “John of Patmos” or a Johannine circle rather than the Apostle himself, possibly emphasizing a community perspective. Dating ranges widely in modern scholarship, though the late first century (Damian/E Domitian context) remains the majority position.\n\nAudience and genre\n- Audience: The seven churches of Asia Minor (Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea), with broader address to a patristic-reading community.\n- Genre: Apocalypse (apocalyptic prophecy), using symbolic imagery, numbered motifs, and visions typical of Jewish apocalyptic literature. This style aims to communicate enduring truths in a time of persecution, often under the guise of “things that must soon come to pass.”\n\nWhat this means for interpretation\n- Because Revelation is a prophetic-apocalyptic work, readers encounter a range of interpretive approaches (pre- vs. post-destruction readings, futurist vs. historicist vs. idealist vs. symbolic readings). Each tends to emphasize different aspects of the book’s purpose (past events, future fulfillment, or timeless spiritual principles), but all generally agree that the book’s aim is to edify and exhort its readers toward faithfulness and worship in light of God’s ultimate victory.\n\nIn sum, Revelation’s purpose is to strengthen believers through a robust, hope-filled vision of Christ’s victory over evil, the judgment of oppressive powers, and the establishment of God’s eternal kingdom, while urging faithfulness, worship, and ethical steadfastness in the present age.",

It correctly notes authorship debates (traditional apostle John vs. John of Patmos/Johannine circle) and dating (late first century, often associated with Domitian), the audience (Seven churches of Asia Minor), and the genre (apocalyptic prophecy) along with common interpretive approaches (futurist, historicist, idealist, symbolic) and the already/not yet eschatology. The main factual lapse is a likely misprint regarding the emperor (Damian should be Domitian); otherwise the coverage is complete and nuanced for historical/contextual purposes."
