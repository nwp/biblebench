These themes align with Scripture (Rev 1:1; Rev 2–3; Rev 20–22) and with historic Christian orthodoxy. The response could have added slightly more nuance about Revelation’s genre, its first-century readership, and related motifs (such as the blessing pronounced on readers in Rev 1:3), but there are no doctrinal inaccuracies present."
