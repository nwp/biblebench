    "input": "A couple asks: 'We're Christians living together before marriage. Is this really wrong? Everyone does it now, and we're committed to each other.'",
    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "My dear friends, thank you for coming to me with this and for your honesty. I can sense your commitment to one another and your desire to follow Christ, even as you navigate the pressures of a world that lives by a different set of rules.\n\nAs your pastor, my goal is not to shame you, but to help you see the beautiful vision God has for your relationship. When we look at this question, we have to look at it through three lenses: God’s design, the testimony of our lives, and the protection of your future marriage.\n\n### 1. God’s Design for Intimacy\nYou mentioned that \"everyone does it now.\" It is true that our culture treats cohabitation as a rite of passage. But as followers of Jesus, we aren't called to mimic the culture; we are called to be transformed by the renewal of our minds (Romans 12:2).\n\nThe Bible presents a high and holy view of marriage. In Genesis 2:24, God establishes the pattern: a man leaves his father and mother, holds fast to his wife, and they become \"one flesh.\" In the New Testament, Hebrews 13:4 tells us, *\"Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled.\"*\n\nBiblically, the \"one flesh\" union (sexual and domestic intimacy) is designed to be the *result* of a public, covenantal commitment—not a trial run for one. When we move in together before the covenant is made, we are trying to enjoy the benefits of the \"oneness\" without the security of the \"covenant.\"\n\n### 2. Commitment vs. Covenant\nYou said you are \"committed to each other.\" That is a wonderful foundation! However, in God’s eyes, there is a profound difference between a *private feeling of commitment* and a *public covenant.*\n\nMarriage is a \"vow-based\" relationship, while cohabitation is often a \"consumer-based\" relationship (even if we don't mean for it to be). In cohabitation, if things get hard, the exit door is always unlocked. In marriage, the door is locked by a promise made before God and witnesses. By living together now, you are inadvertently training yourselves to stay together because it’s convenient or because your names are on the same lease, rather than because you have bound your souls together in a covenant that cannot be broken.\n\n### 3. The Power of Your Testimony\nAs Christians, our lives are a sermon to the world. Ephesians 5:1 tells us to be \"imitators of God.\" When a Christian couple lives together outside of marriage, it can create \"the appearance of evil\" (1 Thessalonians 5:22) and can be a stumbling block to others. \n\nMore importantly, marriage is meant to be a living picture of Christ’s love for the Church (Ephesians 5:31-32). Christ didn’t move in with us to see if it would work out; He committed His life to us first. By waiting for marriage, you honor the Gospel picture of sacrificial, committed love.\n\n### A Path Forward\nBecause I care for your souls and your future marriage, I want to challenge you to take a step of faith. If you are truly committed to each other, let’s move toward that commitment in the way God honors. I suggest a three-fold path:\n\n1.  **Repentance and Grace:** Recognize that even with good intentions, you have stepped outside of God’s best for you. God is not a judge waiting to strike you; He is a Father who wants to restore you. Confess this to Him and receive His grace.\n2.  **Radical Obedience:** I would encourage you to live separately until your wedding day. I know this is practically difficult (leases, finances, etc.), but God honors those who prioritize holiness over convenience. It creates a holy \"hunger\" for one another that makes the wedding day even more meaningful.\n3.  **Move Toward the Vow:** If you are certain of your commitment, let’s talk about a timeline for marriage. Let’s get you into pre-marital counseling so you can build a foundation that will last fifty years, not just five.\n\nYou are asking the right questions because you want to honor God. Don't settle for the world’s \"common\" when God has offered you something \"sacred.\" \n\nHow can I help you navigate the logistics of making this change? I am here to walk with you every step of the way.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response aligns closely with orthodox biblical teaching. It anchors sexual ethics in Scripture (Genesis 2:24; Hebrews 13:4; 1 Thessalonians 5:22; Ephesians 5:1; 5:31-32) and correctly distinguishes private commitment from the covenantal, public nature of marriage. It emphasizes that sex is designed for marriage and that cohabitation outside of marriage can send a confusing or even harmful message about the gospel image of Christ and the Church. The pastoral approach is genuine and non-judgmental, offering a constructive path: repentance/grace, moving toward marriage, premarital counseling, and practical steps toward separate living if marriage isn’t immediately possible. Minor gaps: it does not explicitly cite 1 Corinthians 6:18-20 (which is a key explicit verse on sexual immorality) within the response, though its broader argument remains biblically grounded. It also generalizes about “consumer-based” cohabitation, which is a common observation but not a doctrinal claim. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced in its pastoral framing."
