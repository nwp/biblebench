    "input": "Oneness Pentecostals teach that God is one person who manifests himself in three different modes or roles - sometimes as Father, sometimes as Son, sometimes as Holy Spirit - rather than three distinct persons. Is this orthodox?",
    "expected": "No, this is the ancient heresy of modalism (also called Sabellianism), which was condemned by the early church. Orthodox Christianity teaches that God is one being eternally existing as three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Biblical evidence for their simultaneous distinct existence includes Jesus' baptism (Matthew 3:16-17) where the Son is baptized, the Spirit descends, and the Father speaks - all at the same time. Jesus prays to the Father (John 17), showing personal relationship between persons. The apostolic blessing (2 Corinthians 13:14) distinguishes three persons. Modalism was rejected because it cannot account for the relationships within the Godhead and makes Jesus' prayers to the Father nonsensical.",
    "output": "### Orthodox Christian Theology on the Trinity\n\nOrthodox Christian theology, as defined by the early ecumenical councils (e.g., Nicaea in 325 AD and Constantinople in 381 AD) and enshrined in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, affirms the doctrine of the **Trinity**: one God eternally existing in three distinct, co-equal, co-eternal **persons** (hypostases)—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who share the same divine essence (ousia) but are not merely modes or roles of a single person. This is summarized in the Creed: \"We believe in one God, the Father Almighty... and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God... and in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of life.\" The Trinity preserves both God's absolute unity (monotheism) and the real distinctions observed in Scripture (e.g., the baptism of Jesus in Matthew 3:16-17, where the Father's voice, the Son's incarnation, and the Spirit's descent occur simultaneously).\n\n### Oneness Pentecostal Teaching\n\nOneness Pentecostalism (also called \"Jesus-Only\" Pentecostalism) teaches **modalistic monarchianism** (or Oneness theology): God is a single person who reveals Himself successively in three modes or roles—Father in creation, Son in redemption, and Holy Spirit in regeneration—without three distinct persons. Jesus is seen as the fullness of the Godhead incarnate (Colossians 2:9), so the Father, Son, and Spirit are different manifestations of the one person, Jesus. This leads to practices like baptizing \"in the name of Jesus only\" (Acts 2:38) rather than the Trinitarian formula (Matthew 28:19).\n\n### Areas of Agreement\n- **Monotheism**: Both affirm the **Shema** (Deuteronomy 6:4)—\"The Lord our God, the Lord is one\"—and reject polytheism or tritheism (three gods). Oneness theology rightly emphasizes God's indivisible unity, echoing Jewish roots and countering any dilution of divine oneness.\n- **Full Deity of Christ**: Both hold that Jesus is fully God (John 1:1, 14; Philippians 2:6), countering Arianism.\n- **Scriptural foundation**: Both draw from verses stressing oneness (e.g., Isaiah 9:6, \"Everlasting Father\"; John 10:30, \"I and the Father are one\") and the Spirit's role (John 14:16-17).\n\n### Areas of Departure\nOneness theology **departs significantly** from orthodox Trinitarianism in these key ways:\n- **Denial of distinct persons**: Orthodoxy insists on three **personal distinctions** within the Godhead (e.g., the Son prays to the Father in John 17; the Spirit intercedes in Romans 8:26). Modalism collapses these into sequential modes, implying God changes roles, which contradicts immutability (Malachi 3:6; Hebrews 13:8) and the eternal relations (e.g., the Son is \"eternally begotten,\" not temporarily manifested).\n- **Historical condemnation**: This view resembles **Sabellianism** (3rd century), condemned by church fathers like Tertullian (in *Against Praxeas*) and councils as heretical. It was rejected at Constantinople I (381 AD) to safeguard the distinct personhood affirmed in Scripture.\n- **Christological issues**: If the Son is merely a mode, the incarnation becomes a divine masquerade rather than the eternal Son assuming humanity (Chalcedon, 451 AD). This risks patripassianism (the Father suffering on the cross), blurring Creator-creature distinctions.\n- **Pneumatological issues**: The Holy Spirit as a mode subordinates the Spirit's distinct personhood (e.g., sent by Father and Son in John 15:26).\n- **Baptismal and soteriological implications**: Oneness rejection of Trinitarian baptism is seen by orthodoxy as invalidating a core ordinance tied to Matthew 28:19.\n\n### Is This Orthodox?\n**No, Oneness Pentecostal theology is not orthodox** by historic Christian standards. It is a form of modalism, long classified as heresy because it undermines the relational distinctions in the Godhead essential to biblical revelation (e.g., eternal love between Father and Son, John 17:24). While sincere and biblically motivated—often arising from a zeal for God's oneness amid perceived Trinitarian confusions—it represents a significant departure from the consensus of the undivided church.\n\nRespectfully, Oneness believers are part of the broader Pentecostal tradition emphasizing Spirit baptism and holiness, and many affirm core Christian truths like Christ's atonement. Dialogue often hinges on passages like Matthew 3 and John 17, inviting mutual study. Orthodox Trinitarians appreciate their monotheistic fervor but urge reconsideration of the creedal framework for fuller scriptural harmony.

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately presents orthodox Trinitarianism (one God existing in three eternal, co-equal persons: Father, Son, Spirit) and correctly identifies Oneness Pentecostalism as modalistic monarchianism. It correctly notes historical condemnation of modalism (Sabellianism) and cites key scriptural anchors used in debates (Matthew 3:16-17; John 17; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Romans 8:26; Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38; Colossians 2:9; John 10:30; Deuteronomy 6:4; Hebrews 13:8; Malachi 3:6). It acknowledges monotheism, the full deity of Christ, and the alleged hermeneutical foundations both sides claim, while outlining the essential departures of Oneness theology from historic orthodoxy (denial of three persons, potential patripassian implications, and the Chalcedonian framework). The response also notes practical and doctrinal implications (baptismal formula, prayers of Jesus, intercession of the Spirit) and suggests constructive dialogue and scholarly sources for further reading. Minor caveats exist in nuances around how specific verses (e.g., Isaiah 9:6, John 10:30) are interpreted differently by each tradition, but these are acknowledged and handled with appropriate caveats. Overall, the answer is faithful to historic theology, biblically anchored, and appropriately nuanced. "
