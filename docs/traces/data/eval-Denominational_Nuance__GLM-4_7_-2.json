    "expected": "Calvinism and Arminianism differ primarily on sovereignty and free will. Calvinists emphasize God's unconditional election, where God chooses who will be saved based solely on His will (TULIP: Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance of saints). Arminians emphasize that God's election is based on foreknowledge of who will freely choose faith, that Christ's atonement is unlimited, that grace can be resisted, and that believers can potentially lose salvation. Both affirm salvation by grace through faith and God's sovereignty, but differ on how divine sovereignty relates to human choice. Both views have been held by orthodox Christians throughout church history.",
    "output": "The theological debate between Calvinism and Arminianism is one of the most enduring and significant conversations in Protestant church history. At its heart, this debate explores how God’s sovereignty relates to human responsibility, particularly regarding the process of salvation.\n\nAs a fair-minded theologian, it is important to acknowledge at the outset that both traditions are deeply rooted in Scripture, both affirm the core tenets of the Christian faith (such as the Trinity, the Deity of Christ, and the necessity of grace), and both have produced saints, scholars, and missionaries who have profoundly advanced the Kingdom of God.\n\nThe differences are often systematized using the \"Five Points of Calvinism\" (often remembered by the acronym TULIP), which were originally drafted in 1619 at the Synod of Dort to respond to the \"Remonstrance\" of the Arminians.\n\nHere is an accurate comparison of the two perspectives on these five key points.\n\n### 1. Human Nature and Sin\n**The Core Question:** Are humans capable of choosing God on their own, or is our will enslaved by sin?\n\n*   **Calvinist View (Total Depravity):**\n    Calvinists teach that because of the Fall, humanity is spiritually dead. Sin has affected every part of human nature—mind, will, and emotions. Consequently, human beings are not simply sick or injured; they are spiritually incapable of inclining themselves toward God. Therefore, no one would ever choose God unless God first intervened to change their nature.\n\n*   **Arminian View (Depravity with Prevenient Grace):**\n    Arminians agree that humanity is deeply fallen and cannot save themselves. However, they generally reject the idea that the human will is \"enslaved\" in a way that makes response impossible. They believe that through **Prevenient Grace** (grace that \"goes before\"), the Holy Spirit restores a measure of free will to all people, enabling them to respond to the Gospel. While we cannot save ourselves, we are given the grace to accept or reject the offer of salvation.\n\n### 2. Divine Election\n**The Core Question:** Whom does God choose to save, and upon what basis is that choice made?\n\n*   **Calvinist View (Unconditional Election):**\n    This view holds that God’s choice of who will be saved is based solely on His sovereign will and good pleasure, not on any foreseen action or condition within the individual. Before the foundation of the world, God elected certain individuals to receive eternal life. This election is not dependent on human merit or even foreseen faith; it is an act of God's free mercy.\n\n*   **Arminian View (Conditional Election):**\n    Arminians believe that God, in His foreknowledge, looked ahead through time and saw who would place their faith in Christ. Election is therefore conditional; God chooses to save those whom He foresees will believe. In this view, God’s election is corporate (He chooses the Church, the body of Christ) and individual believers are added to that number through faith.\n\n### 3. The Atonement\n**The Core Question:** For whom did Christ die?\n\n*   **Calvinist View (Limited Atonement or Particular Redemption):**\n    Calvinists argue that Christ’s death was efficacious—meaning it actually secured salvation for a specific people. They believe that Christ did not simply make salvation *possible* for everyone, but that He actually atoned for the sins of the elect. Therefore, His sacrifice perfectly accomplishes the salvation of those for whom it was intended.\n\n*   **Arminian View (Unlimited Atonement or Universal Atonement):**\n    Arminians teach that Christ’s atoning sacrifice was sufficient for all and was offered on behalf of all people without exception. However, while the payment for sin is available to everyone, it is only *efficacious* (effective) for those who place their faith in Jesus. In this view, the barrier to salvation is not the limits of the atonement, but the unbelief of the sinner.\n\n### 4. Grace and Human Will\n**The Core Question:** Can a person resist the call of the Holy Spirit?\n\n*   **Calvinist View (Irresistible Grace):**\n    Since humanity is spiritually dead, Calvinists argue that the call to salvation must be effective. When God calls an elect person to Himself, He does more than just invite them; He changes their heart, causing them to be born again (regeneration precedes faith). Because of this inward transformation, the elect person cannot help but willingly come to Christ. The grace is \"irresistible\" not in the sense that it forces us against our will, but that it changes our nature so that we willingly desire what God desires.\n\n*   **Arminian View (Resistible Grace):**\n    Arminians believe that God’s grace is genuinely extended to all people through the preaching of the Gospel and the work of the Spirit. While God actively seeks to draw people to Himself, He does not force the human will. Humans possess the God-given freedom to accept this grace or to resist and reject it. Therefore, it is possible to spurn the Holy Spirit’s invitation.\n\n### 5. The Security of the Believer\n**The Core Question:** Can a true believer lose their salvation?\n\n*   **Calvinist View (Perseverance of the Saints):**\n    Calvinists hold that because salvation is a work of God from start to finish, those who are truly elect and regenerated will persevere to the end. While a believer may fall into temporary sin, they will not ultimately fall away from the faith. God preserves them, ensuring that the good work He began in them will be completed.\n\n*   **Arminian View (Conditional Security / Possibility of Apostasy):**\n    Arminians generally believe that our relationship with Christ is maintained through continued faith. They warn that it is possible for a believer to turn away from the faith, willfully reject God’s grace, and thereby lose their salvation. They argue that the Bible contains warnings against falling away, which would be unnecessary if salvation were guaranteed regardless of future actions.\n\n### Summary and Ecclesial Context\n\nIt is helpful to view these differences through the lens of **God’s Sovereignty vs. Human Responsibility**. Calvinism emphasizes the monergistic (one-working) view that God alone initiates and completes salvation to ensure His glory. Arminianism emphasizes the synergistic (working-together) view that while God initiates grace, the human response is a necessary component to the relationship.\n\n**Denominational Affiliations:**\n*   **Calvinist traditions** include many Presbyterian churches (PCA), Reformed churches (CRC, RCUS), and some Baptist groups (e.g., Founders Ministries, Sovereign Grace).\n*   **Arminian traditions** include Methodist, Nazarene, Pentecostal (Assemblies of God), and many General Baptist and Holiness movements.\n\nIt is also worth noting that many believers sit somewhere in the middle (often called \"Amyraldians\" or \"4-point Calvinists\"), and many denominations (like the Anglican/Episcopal church) historically allow for a wide spectrum of views on these specifics.\n\n### A Theological Conclusion\nWhile these differences are significant and have profound implications for how we understand evangelism and the Christian life, they do not constitute the Gospel itself. Both Calvinists and Arminians affirm that we are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, not by works. As the Apostle Paul writes in Romans 8:38-39, nothing can separate us from the love of God—a promise in which both traditions find their ultimate hope and assurance.",

A tighter formulation would distinguish regeneration/effective calling for the elect from ongoing human resistance before belief."

          "rationale": "The response is broadly accurate and well-structured, and it captures the core distinctions between Calvinism and Arminianism (depravity, election, atonement, grace, perseverance) in line with historic Protestant thought. It is practically faithful to Scripture and classic church teaching. The main caveats are (1) a potentially over-emphasized corporate-election angle for Arminianism, which is not the unanimous stance within that camp, and (2) a need for a more precise articulation of Irresistible Grace to avoid implying absolute, universal coercion of the will. Overall, it presents a solid, nuanced overview with a sound doctrinal and biblical orientation."
