The substitution of 'mixture' for 'change' is theologically inaccurate though the intent is close."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer accurately states the hypostatic union as one Person with two complete natures (divine and human) united without confusion, change, division, or separation. It correctly traces biblical support (John 1:1-14; Col 2:9; Phil 2:6; Heb 2:14-17; 1 Tim 2:5) and cites Chalcedon (451) to define orthodoxy. It notes the salvific and mediatorial significance of the union. The only notable issue is a minor variation in the Chalcedonian wording (the standard list uses 'change' instead of 'mixture'), which does not undermine the doctrine but should be corrected for precision."

          "explanation": "Assessment: The response presents orthodox Christology. It accurately explains the hypostatic union — one person (the Son) with two complete natures, divine and human, united without mixture, change, division, or separation — in line with the Chalcedonian Definition (451 AD). The biblical citations (John 1:1,14; Colossians 2:9; Philippians 2:6; Hebrews 2:14,17; 1 Timothy 2:5) support both the deity and humanity of Christ as foundational to the doctrine. The “Why It Matters” section (salvation requires both natures; Christ as mediator) aligns with historic orthodox teaching. The response also correctly flags common Christological heresies to be mindful of (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism) and does not promote any of them. No explicit or implicit heretical claim is present. A potential enhancement could include noting historic debates such as Miaphysitism to acknowledge related controversies, but this is not a doctrinal error. Overall severity: none."
