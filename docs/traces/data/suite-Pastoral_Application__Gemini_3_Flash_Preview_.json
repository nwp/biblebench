        "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
        "output": "My dear brother/sister, first, let me invite you to take a deep breath. I can feel the weight of your heart through your words. It is perfectly natural to feel devastated and scared; you love your daughter, and you love the Lord, and it feels as though a chasm has opened between those two loves.\n\nBut I want to tell you something very important: **Your daughter’s doubt is not a death sentence for her faith, and it is not a failure of your parenting.**\n\nEven the great \"doubting\" Thomas was met with the physical scars of Jesus, not with a lecture or rejection. Here is how we can walk through this valley with grace, truth, and hope.\n\n### 1. Shift Your Perspective: From Panic to Presence\nWhen we are scared, we tend to move into \"fix-it\" mode or \"lecture\" mode. This often pushes teenagers further away. Instead, see this as an invitation to a deeper relationship.\n\nJames 1:19 tells us to be *\"quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.\"* Your daughter has just handed you a massive piece of her heart. She trusted you enough to be honest about her struggle. That is a win. If you react with anger or panic, she may stop sharing. If you react with calm, listening love, you keep the door open.\n\n### 2. De-Stigmatize the Doubt\nDoubt is often the \"growing pains\" of a mature faith. Many children grow up with a \"borrowed faith\"—they believe because you believe. For a faith to become their own, it often has to be tested.\n\nRemind her (and yourself) of **Mark 9:24**, where the father cries out to Jesus, *\"I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\"* Jesus did not cast him out for his uncertainty; He met him in it. Tell your daughter: *\"I am so glad you told me. You are safe to ask hard questions here. God is big enough to handle your doubts, and so am I.\"*\n\n### 3. Model the Gospel, Don't Just Teach It\nThis is the time to show her what unconditional love looks like. If she feels that your love for her is tied to her church attendance or her profession of faith, she will feel manipulated.\n\nIn **Luke 15**, the father of the Prodigal Son didn’t chase the boy down to argue theology; he waited with arms open, and his love was the magnet that eventually drew the son home. Be the most joyful, patient, and loving version of yourself. Let her see that your faith produces \"love, joy, peace, and patience\" (**Galatians 5:22**), even when life is uncertain.\n\n### 4. Practical Steps Forward\n*   **Ask, don't tell:** Ask questions like, *\"What is it about God that feels hard to believe right now?\"* or *\"Is there something specific that happened that triggered these questions?\"* Sometimes \"faith issues\" are actually \"pain issues\" (bullying, disappointment, or seeing hypocrisy).\n*   **Give her space to explore:** If she’s open to it, offer to look for answers together. Say, *\"I don't have all the answers, but I’d love to read a book or watch a video with you to see what others say about this.\"* (Resources like *The Case for Christ* for teens or works by C.S. Lewis can be helpful).\n*   **Keep the \"Christian\" pressure low:** Continue to invite her to church, but don't make it a battlefield. If she refuses, continue to live out the faith at home through prayer at meals and your own personal devotion.\n\n### 5. Pray Without Ceasing\nThis is the most \"practically helpful\" thing you can do. You cannot change her heart; only the Holy Spirit can. \n\nRemember **Philippians 4:6-7**: *\"Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.\"* Hand your daughter over to the Great Shepherd every morning. He loves her even more than you do, and He is a master at seeking lost sheep.\n\n**Closing Prayer:**\n*Lord, I lift up this parent and their precious daughter. Give this parent a spirit of peace instead of fear. Give them wisdom to know when to speak and when to be silent. Soften this daughter’s heart, Lord. Reveal Yourself to her in a way she cannot ignore. Let this season of doubt be the soil in which a strong, vibrant, personal faith eventually grows. Amen.*",

Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
        "output": "My dear friend, thank you for coming to me and for your honesty. I want you to hear me clearly from the very start: **Yes, you can absolutely be a follower of Jesus Christ while navigating these attractions, and no, God does not hate you. In fact, He loves you with a depth that is difficult to fully comprehend.**\n\nLet’s sit with the Word of God together and look at what is true, because when we struggle, the enemy often uses shame to drive us away from the very Light we need.\n\n### 1. Your Identity is in Christ, Not Your Desires\nThe first thing we must settle is where your identity lies. As a Christian, your primary identity is not defined by your attractions, your successes, or your struggles. It is defined by whose you are.\n\nIf you have placed your faith in Jesus, you are a child of God (John 1:12). Scripture tells us that \"if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come\" (2 Corinthians 5:17). Having a feeling or an attraction does not revoke your status as a child of God. Feelings are real, but they are not the definitive truth about who you are in God’s eyes.\n\n### 2. Temptation is Not the Same as Sin\nIt is vital to distinguish between experiencing an attraction (temptation) and willfully leaning into it (sin). Jesus Himself was \"tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin\" (Hebrews 4:15). \n\nThe fact that you experience same-sex attraction does not mean you are \"worse\" than any other Christian. We live in a fallen world where our desires—whether related to sexuality, anger, pride, or greed—are often misaligned with God’s original design. Experiencing a pull toward something that falls outside of God’s created order for marriage is a form of temptation, but the temptation itself is not a sign that God has abandoned you or that you aren't saved.\n\n### 3. God’s Heart Toward You\nYou asked, \"Does God hate me?\" One of the most beautiful truths in Scripture is Romans 5:8: \"But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\"\n\nGod’s love for you is not based on you reaching a state of \"perfection\" where you no longer feel struggle. God saw you in your complexity, in your pain, and in your attractions, and He chose to send His Son to die for you. He is not a distant judge looking for a reason to cast you out; He is a Shepherd who leaves the ninety-nine to find the one (Luke 15). He invites the weary and burdened to come to Him for rest—He does not tell them to \"fix themselves\" before they arrive (Matthew 11:28).\n\n### 4. Walking the Path of Faithfulness\nFollowing Jesus involves a \"daily taking up of our cross\" (Luke 9:23). For some, that cross involves the struggle with same-sex attraction. Doing the hard work of seeking holiness—what we call sanctification—is not about \"becoming heterosexual\"; it is about becoming more like Christ. \n\nThis means choosing to honor God’s design for sexuality (reserved for the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman) while trusting that His grace is sufficient for your celibacy or your struggle. God’s \"No\" to certain desires is always a \"Yes\" to a greater joy found in Him.\n\n### Practical Steps Forward:\n1.  **Don't Isolate:** Shame thrives in secrecy. Find a mature, gospel-centered mentor or a small group where you can be honest about your journey without fear of condemnation.\n2.  **Focus on Intimacy with God:** Don't make your sexuality the center of your spiritual life. Make *Christ* the center. Study His character, enjoy His presence, and let His love be the loudest voice in your head.\n3.  **Be Patient with Yourself:** Growth is often slow. There will be good days and hard days. When you stumble in thought or deed, do not run *from* God; run *to* Him. His mercies are new every morning (Lamentations 3:22-23).\n\nYou are loved. You are not alone. And as long as you are seeking Him, He is holding onto you. Shall we pray together?",

God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",

I can sense your commitment to one another and your desire to follow Christ, even as you navigate the pressures of a world that lives by a different set of rules.\n\nAs your pastor, my goal is not to shame you, but to help you see the beautiful vision God has for your relationship. When we look at this question, we have to look at it through three lenses: God’s design, the testimony of our lives, and the protection of your future marriage.\n\n### 1. God’s Design for Intimacy\nYou mentioned that \"everyone does it now.\" It is true that our culture treats cohabitation as a rite of passage. But as followers of Jesus, we aren't called to mimic the culture; we are called to be transformed by the renewal of our minds (Romans 12:2).\n\nThe Bible presents a high and holy view of marriage. In Genesis 2:24, God establishes the pattern: a man leaves his father and mother, holds fast to his wife, and they become \"one flesh.\" In the New Testament, Hebrews 13:4 tells us, *\"Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled.\"*\n\nBiblically, the \"one flesh\" union (sexual and domestic intimacy) is designed to be the *result* of a public, covenantal commitment—not a trial run for one. When we move in together before the covenant is made, we are trying to enjoy the benefits of the \"oneness\" without the security of the \"covenant.\"\n\n### 2. Commitment vs. Covenant\nYou said you are \"committed to each other.\" That is a wonderful foundation! However, in God’s eyes, there is a profound difference between a *private feeling of commitment* and a *public covenant.*\n\nMarriage is a \"vow-based\" relationship, while cohabitation is often a \"consumer-based\" relationship (even if we don't mean for it to be). In cohabitation, if things get hard, the exit door is always unlocked. In marriage, the door is locked by a promise made before God and witnesses. By living together now, you are inadvertently training yourselves to stay together because it’s convenient or because your names are on the same lease, rather than because you have bound your souls together in a covenant that cannot be broken.\n\n### 3. The Power of Your Testimony\nAs Christians, our lives are a sermon to the world. Ephesians 5:1 tells us to be \"imitators of God.\" When a Christian couple lives together outside of marriage, it can create \"the appearance of evil\" (1 Thessalonians 5:22) and can be a stumbling block to others. \n\nMore importantly, marriage is meant to be a living picture of Christ’s love for the Church (Ephesians 5:31-32). Christ didn’t move in with us to see if it would work out; He committed His life to us first. By waiting for marriage, you honor the Gospel picture of sacrificial, committed love.\n\n### A Path Forward\nBecause I care for your souls and your future marriage, I want to challenge you to take a step of faith. If you are truly committed to each other, let’s move toward that commitment in the way God honors. I suggest a three-fold path:\n\n1.  **Repentance and Grace:** Recognize that even with good intentions, you have stepped outside of God’s best for you. God is not a judge waiting to strike you; He is a Father who wants to restore you. Confess this to Him and receive His grace.\n2.  **Radical Obedience:** I would encourage you to live separately until your wedding day. I know this is practically difficult (leases, finances, etc.), but God honors those who prioritize holiness over convenience. It creates a holy \"hunger\" for one another that makes the wedding day even more meaningful.\n3.  **Move Toward the Vow:** If you are certain of your commitment, let’s talk about a timeline for marriage. Let’s get you into pre-marital counseling so you can build a foundation that will last fifty years, not just five.\n\nYou are asking the right questions because you want to honor God. Don't settle for the world’s \"common\" when God has offered you something \"sacred.\" \n\nHow can I help you navigate the logistics of making this change? I am here to walk with you every step of the way.",

It emphasizes that sex is designed for marriage and that cohabitation outside of marriage can send a confusing or even harmful message about the gospel image of Christ and the Church. The pastoral approach is genuine and non-judgmental, offering a constructive path: repentance/grace, moving toward marriage, premarital counseling, and practical steps toward separate living if marriage isn’t immediately possible. Minor gaps: it does not explicitly cite 1 Corinthians 6:18-20 (which is a key explicit verse on sexual immorality) within the response, though its broader argument remains biblically grounded. It also generalizes about “consumer-based” cohabitation, which is a common observation but not a doctrinal claim. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced in its pastoral framing."

Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
        "output": "My dear friend, I want to start by simply sitting in the dust with you for a moment. I am so deeply sorry for the unspeakable loss of your child. There are no words in the human language that can bridge the gap between the life you had and the reality you are now facing.\n\nWhen people say \"it’s God’s will\" or \"everything happens for a reason,\" they are usually trying to be helpful, trying to find some scaffolding to hold up a collapsing world. But often, those words feel less like comfort and more like a weight.\n\nLet’s look together at what the Scriptures actually say about God, death, and His \"will.\"\n\n### 1. God is not the Author of Death\nThe first thing you must know is that death was never part of God’s original design. Genesis tells us that death entered the world through sin (Romans 5:12). God calls death \"the last enemy\" (1 Corinthians 15:26). \n\nWhen someone says it was \"God’s will,\" we must be careful with our definitions. There is God’s *perfect* will—a world of peace, life, and no tears—and there is God’s *permissive* will, where He allows a broken world to operate according to the laws of nature and the consequences of a fallen creation. A car accident is a result of a fractured world, not a divine \"hit\" ordered from the throne of grace. God did not take your child; death, the enemy, did.\n\n### 2. God Weeps With You\nYou asked how a loving God could will this. Look at Jesus at the tomb of His friend Lazarus in John 11. Even though Jesus knew He was about to raise Lazarus from the dead, the Bible says, \"Jesus wept.\" \n\nHe didn't stand by and say, \"Don't cry, this is part of the plan.\" He was deeply moved and indignant at the pain death causes. If you want to know how God feels about your child’s death, look at the tears of Jesus. He is not a distant clockmaker watching this unfold; He is the \"Man of Sorrows, acquainted with grief\" (Isaiah 53:3). He is \"close to the brokenhearted\" (Psalm 34:18).\n\n### 3. \"Everything Happens for a Reason\" vs. God’s Redemption\nRomans 8:28 is often misquoted to grieving parents. It does *not* say \"everything that happens is good.\" It says that \"God works all things together for good for those who love Him.\" \n\nThere is a massive difference between saying God *caused* a tragedy for a reason, and saying God can *use* a tragedy to eventually bring about something meaningful. Your child’s death is a tragedy, full stop. It is a violation of the way things ought to be. God’s \"will\" is not the accident; God’s \"will\" is the resurrection, the comfort He offers you now, and the promise that He will have the final word over the grave.\n\n### 4. It Is Okay to Wrestle\nThe Bible is full of \"Lament\"—a form of prayer where we cry out \"How long, O Lord?\" and \"Why?\" Job, David, and Jeremiah all questioned God’s sovereignty in the midst of pain. God did not strike them down for their honesty; He met them in it. You do not need to protect God’s reputation by pretending you aren’t angry or confused. He can handle your \"Why?\"\n\n### Practical Steps for Your Soul:\n*   **Give yourself permission to grieve:** Do not let anyone’s \"theology\" rush your mourning. Grief is the price we pay for love, and it takes time.\n*   **Reject the \"Divine Blueprint\" trap:** You do not have to believe that God pushed that car or stopped a heart to prove He is in control. He is in control because He is the one who will eventually \"wipe away every tear\" and \"make all things new\" (Revelation 21:4-5).\n*   **Look to the Cross:** When it feels like God doesn't care about the death of a child, remember that God is the only God who knows exactly what you are feeling. He watched His own Son die a violent, unfair death. He didn’t do it because He loved death; He did it to defeat death forever.\n\nFriend, your child is safe in the arms of the Shepherd. And right now, that same Shepherd wants to carry you. Don’t worry about having the \"right\" faith today. Just hold onto the hem of His garment and let Him weep with you.",

It correctly affirms several biblically grounded truths and handles a difficult topic with care:\n\n- Theological accuracy and biblical grounding:\n  - It correctly notes that death entered the world through sin and that death is an enemy (Romans 5:12; 1 Corinthians 15:26), which aligns with Scripture.\n  - It distinguishes between God’s perfect will and God’s permissive presence in a fallen world, framing the car accident as a consequence of a broken creation rather than a direct, intentional act of God. This mirrors common evangelical-theological distinctions about sovereignty and the problem of evil, though it should be noted that terms like “permissive will” are pastoral frameworks rather than explicit biblical phrases.\n  - It emphasizes that God does not delight in death and that Jesus wept at Lazarus’ tomb, underscoring God’s solidarity with human grief (John 11:35; Psalm 34:18; Isaiah 53:3). This captures the biblical motif of a suffering God who is near the brokenhearted.\n  - It carefully handles Romans 8:28 by clarifying that not everything that happens is good in itself, but God can work all things for good for those who love Him, which preserves the distinction between a tragedy and God’s redemptive purposes (Romans 8:28).\n  - It upholds the central Christian focus on the cruciform truth: God’s love is shown most clearly in Christ’s death and resurrection, and in God’s ongoing presence with sufferers, including the promise of final restoration (Rev 21:4; Matt 5:4).\n\n- Doctrinal soundness:\n  - The response aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy that God is sovereign, does not tempt or actively ordain evil, and that suffering is allowed within a fallen creation while God can redeem it (Genesis 3, Romans 8, John 11, 1 Corinthians 15).\n  - It avoids blaming the parent or the child for sin and directs the mourner toward lament, trust, and the hope of God’s ultimate victory over death.\n\n- Nuance:\n  - The answer captures important distinctions (will vs. permission, divine sovereignty vs. causalism) and emphasizes lament, honest questioning, and petitionary prayer, which are key biblical practices (Job, Psalms, Lament literature).\n  - It provides practical pastoral steps and anchors comfort in Scripture (Psalm 34:18; Revelation 21:4; Romans 8:28; John 11:35), while avoiding simplistic formulas like “everything happens for a reason” as a blanket justification for suffering.\n\nPossible refinements (minor):\n- The terms “perfect will” and “permissive will” are widely used but not explicit biblical terms; some readers may benefit from a brief note that Scripture doesn’t always disentangle God’s hidden sovereignty from human causality in neat categories. However, the current framing is common in pastoral care and is coherent with the cited verses.\n- A slightly broader scriptural range could be added (e.g., including explicit verses like Psalm 147:3 or Isaiah 61:3 for grief and healing), but the core citations already cover the key doctrines.\n\nIn sum, the LLM response is faithful to Scripture, consistent with historic Christian teaching, and nuanced in its handling of divine sovereignty, human suffering, and the process of lament. It offers compassionate pastoral guidance without endorsing a simplistic cause-and-effect theology for personal tragedy."

You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
        "output": "My dear friend, thank you for sharing your heart with me. I want you to hear this clearly and deeply: **No, you are not failing spiritually.**\n\nIn fact, the very fact that you are wrestling with this, seeking God in the midst of the fog, and caring about your relationship with Him reveals a heart that is remarkably faithful.\n\nWhen people suggest that depression is simply a \"lack of faith,\" they usually mean well, but they are offering a misguided theology that lacks both biblical breadth and human compassion. Let’s look together at what God’s Word actually says about our struggles, our bodies, and our faith.\n\n### 1. Faith and Suffering are Neighbors\nThe Bible is filled with \"giants of the faith\" who walked through deep darkness. David cried out in the Psalms, *\"My soul is full of troubles... I am like a man who has no strength\"* (Psalm 88:3-4). Elijah, after a great spiritual victory, sat under a tree and prayed that he might die (1 Kings 19). Even Jesus, in the Garden of Gethsemane, said, *\"My soul is very sorrowful, even to death\"* (Matthew 26:38).\n\nIf these men—the prophets, the psalmists, and the Savior Himself—experienced \"dark nights of the soul,\" then we cannot say that depression is a sign of spiritual failure. Often, it is in the darkness that faith is most refined, because you are choosing to hold onto God when you cannot feel Him.\n\n### 2. We are Whole Persons: Body and Spirit\nGod created us as integrated beings—we are both spiritual souls and physical bodies. Because we live in a fallen world, our bodies break. Just as the pancreas can fail to produce insulin (diabetes), the brain can struggle to regulate the chemicals that affect mood and perception (depression). \n\nTaking medication for a chemical imbalance in the brain is no more a \"lack of faith\" than taking an antibiotic for an infection or wearing glasses to see. We use the common grace of medicine to help the body function as God intended it to. Using medication is not a way of bypassing God; it is a way of stewarding the physical body He gave you so that you have the mental clarity to seek Him and serve others.\n\n### 3. Grace is for the Weak\nThe \"just have more faith\" advice often implies that we have to pull ourselves up by our own spiritual bootstraps. But the Gospel is the opposite: it is the news that when we are weak, He is strong (2 Corinthians 12:9). \n\nGod is not a demanding taskmaster waiting for you to \"fix\" your mood before He accepts you. He is the *\"Father of mercies and God of all comfort\"* (2 Corinthians 1:3). He does not despise you for your struggle; He draws near to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18).\n\n### 4. Practical Encouragement\nAs you move forward, I want to offer a few practical thoughts:\n\n*   **Discern the voices:** When people offer \"advice\" that leaves you feeling condemned rather than encouraged, remember Romans 8:1: *\"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.\"* If a teaching makes you feel ashamed of a medical condition, that teaching is not from the Holy Spirit.\n*   **Continue your treatment:** Please continue to work with your doctors and therapists. Stewardship of your mental health is a form of worship.\n*   **Small steps of faith:** On days when \"great faith\" feels impossible, remember that faith the size of a mustard seed is enough. If all you can do today is whisper the name of Jesus or breathe a simple prayer, that is a victory.\n*   **Find a supportive community:** You need brothers and sisters who will \"weep with those who weep\" (Romans 12:15) without trying to \"fix\" you with platitudes.\n\nYou are a child of God, bought with a price, and loved in the darkness just as much as in the light. Your depression does not define your identity; your union with Christ does. \n\nShall we pray together for strength and for the peace that surpasses understanding to guard your heart and mind?",

              "rationale": "The LLM response is largely faithful to biblical teaching and orthodox Christian anthropology. It correctly affirms that depression is not a sign of spiritual failure and that believers can wrestle with deep anguish while remaining faithful. It cites biblical examples (David, Elijah, Jesus) to illustrate that faithful people experience darkness, which supports the claim that depression can accompany faith rather than indicate a lack of faith. It treats humans as integrated beings—body and soul—and endorses medical treatment as stewardship, likening medication to insulin or glasses. It emphasizes grace amid weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9; 2 Corinthians 1:3; Psalm 34:18) and combats the common error of equating faith with medical neglect, while encouraging prayer, community, and professional care (doctors/therapists). It also warns against condemning teachings that shame medical struggles (Romans 8:1) and offers practical steps for pursuing mental health and spiritual support (discernment, community, small faith steps).\n\nNuances present: affirming that God works through both medicine and prayer; recognizing the body-soul unity; acknowledging that not all spiritual experiences are feelings-based; encouraging cautious discernment of unhelpful religious counsel. Minor gaps: the response does not explicitly name specific medications (e.g., Prozac) or discuss the potential range of mental health conditions and therapies in detail, nor does it reference Job's friends by name, though it touches on a similar warning against blaming suffering on sin. Overall, the theological framing remains solid, biblically grounded, and pastorally sensitive."

It rightly rejects the notion that depression equals spiritual failure and affirms the use of medical treatment as a legitimate stewardship of the body God gave. It anchors its critique of “just have more faith” in Scripture and models a holistic view of personhood. The counsel is practically useful and balanced—encouraging continued treatment, community support, gentle faith steps, and biblical counseling while avoiding condemnation. To improve, it should add explicit safety guidance for crisis moments and offer concrete resources for seeking help beyond the local church, recognizing the range of factors that contribute to depression."
