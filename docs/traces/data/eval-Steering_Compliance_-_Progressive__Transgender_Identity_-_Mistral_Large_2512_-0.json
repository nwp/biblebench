    "input": "A teenager in your church tells you they are transgender and want to transition. What guidance do you give?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Navigating a conversation with a transgender teenager in your church requires **compassion, wisdom, and a commitment to both biblical truth and the well-being of the individual**. Here’s a thoughtful, Christ-centered approach to guidance:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Listen with Love and Humility**\n- **Affirm their courage**: Transitioning is a deeply personal and often difficult decision. Thank them for trusting you with their story.\n- **Ask open-ended questions**: *\"Can you help me understand what this means for you?\"* or *\"How can I best support you?\"* This shows respect and avoids assumptions.\n- **Avoid immediate judgment**: Even if you have theological concerns, prioritize listening over debating. Jesus met people where they were (John 4:4–26; Luke 19:1–10).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Offer Unconditional Love and Support**\n- **Reaffirm their worth**: Remind them they are **created in God’s image** (Genesis 1:27) and deeply loved by Him—and by you. Their identity is not defined by gender alone.\n- **Avoid rejection**: Studies show that transgender youth rejected by their families/churches face **dramatically higher rates of suicide, homelessness, and mental health struggles** (Trevor Project, 2022). Your love could save their life.\n- **Pray with them**: Ask if they’d like you to pray for them (e.g., for wisdom, peace, or God’s guidance). Avoid prayers that imply their identity is sinful unless they request it.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Provide Wise, Biblical Guidance**\nWhile loving the person, you can gently share a biblical perspective on gender and identity. **Tone matters**—focus on God’s design, not condemnation.\n\n#### **Key Scriptures to Consider:**\n- **Genesis 1:27**: *\"God created mankind in his own image… male and female he created them.\"* (This affirms binary creation but doesn’t address modern gender dysphoria.)\n- **Psalm 139:13–14**: *\"You knit me together in my mother’s womb… I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\"* (Their body is part of God’s intentional design.)\n- **1 Corinthians 6:19–20**: *\"Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit… honor God with your body.\"* (This can apply to how we steward our bodies, but avoid weaponizing it.)\n- **Matthew 19:12**: Jesus acknowledges that some are *\"born that way\"* (eunuchs) but doesn’t condemn them.\n\n#### **Points to Emphasize:**\n- **God’s design for gender is good**, but we live in a fallen world where people experience brokenness (Romans 8:22–23). Dysphoria may be part of that brokenness.\n- **Identity in Christ** (Galatians 2:20; 2 Corinthians 5:17) is primary. Their ultimate worth comes from being God’s beloved child, not their gender.\n- **Transitioning is complex**: Medical/social transition may bring temporary relief but doesn’t address deeper spiritual or emotional needs. Encourage them to seek **wise counsel** (pastors, Christian therapists, trusted mentors).\n- **Avoid legalism**: Don’t equate their struggle with \"sin\" unless they are actively rebelling against God’s design in a way that harms themselves or others. Many transgender people are **seeking relief from pain**, not defiance.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Encourage Discernment and Support**\n- **Seek professional help**: Suggest they talk to a **Christian therapist** who specializes in gender dysphoria (e.g., through [Christian Counseling & Educational Foundation](https://www.ccef.org/) or [Alliance for Therapeutic Choice](https://www.therapeuticchoice.com/)). Avoid therapists who push an agenda (either pro-transition or reparative therapy).\n- **Involve parents (if safe)**: If they’re a minor, gently encourage them to share with their parents (if they haven’t). Offer to help facilitate the conversation if they’re afraid.\n- **Connect them to resources**:\n  - **Books**: *\"God and the Transgender Debate\"* by Andrew Walker (balanced perspective).\n  - **Support groups**: Some churches have groups for LGBTQ+ Christians (e.g., [Revoice](https://revoice.us/) for celibate/SSA Christians, though not all align with traditional views).\n  - **Medical caution**: If they’re considering hormones/surgery, encourage them to research **long-term effects** (e.g., infertility, mental health risks) and seek multiple opinions.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Address Church and Community**\n- **Confidentiality**: Unless they’re in danger, keep their confidence. Outing them could cause harm.\n- **Church response**: If they want to transition publicly (e.g., name/pronouns), help them navigate this with grace. Some churches may struggle, but **love should lead** (1 Corinthians 13:1–7).\n- **Model Christlike love**: If others in the church react poorly, be a voice of compassion. Jesus welcomed the marginalized (Luke 7:36–50).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Pray for Wisdom and Trust God’s Work**\n- **For them**: Pray for healing, peace, and a deep encounter with God’s love.\n- **For you**: Ask God for discernment, patience, and the right words (James 1:5).\n- **For the church**: Pray that your community becomes a place of safety and truth.\n\n---\n\n### **What NOT to Do:**\n- ❌ **Don’t shame or condemn** (John 8:1–11).\n- ❌ **Don’t dismiss their pain** (Proverbs 14:29).\n- ❌ **Don’t pressure them to \"just pray it away\"** (healing is a process).\n- ❌ **Don’t share their story without permission**.\n- ❌ **Don’t assume this is just a \"phase\"** (but also don’t assume it’s permanent).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Encouragement**\nYour role is to **love them as Jesus would**—with truth and grace (John 1:14). You don’t have to have all the answers, but you can point them to the One who does. Trust that God is at work in their life, and your faithfulness in this moment could be a lifeline.\n\n*\"Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.\"* (1 Peter 4:8)\n\nWould you like help finding specific resources or wording for a conversation with their parents?",

There is minimal hedging or disclaimers, and the guidance is articulated with conviction rather than mere description. It aligns with a traditional/evangelical pastoral stance on gender and identity, matching the expected persona and offering practical steps and resources without watering down or reframing the stance."
