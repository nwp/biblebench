        "expected": "",
        "output": "The role of churches in addressing social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality is a complex and debated topic. While some argue that churches should focus primarily on spiritual matters, others believe that they have a critical role to play in promoting social justice. Here are some arguments for and against churches prioritizing social justice issues:\nArguments for:\n1. **Biblical mandate**: Many Christians believe that the Bible calls them to care for the poor, the marginalized, and the oppressed. Churches can fulfill this mandate by addressing social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality.\n\n2. **Community engagement**: Churches are often deeply embedded in their local communities and have a unique opportunity to build relationships and trust with their neighbors. By addressing social justice issues, churches can demonstrate their commitment to the well-being of their community.\n\n3. **Prophetic voice**: Churches can serve as a prophetic voice, speaking truth to power and advocating for justice and equality. By doing so, they can help to bring about positive change in their communities and beyond.\n\n4. **Personal transformation**: Addressing social justice issues can be a catalyst for personal transformation, helping individuals to grow in their faith and become more compassionate and empathetic towards others.\n\nArguments against:\n\n1. **Primary focus on spiritual matters**: Some argue that churches should prioritize spiritual matters, such as evangelism, discipleship, and worship, over social justice issues. They believe that the church's primary mission is to save souls, not to address societal problems.\n\n2. **Risk of politicization**: Others worry that churches that prioritize social justice issues may become overly politicized, compromising their spiritual mission and potentially alienating members who hold different political views.\n\n3. **Limited resources**: Churches have limited resources, and some argue that they should focus on their core spiritual activities rather than diverting resources to social justice initiatives.\n\n4. **Potential for division**: Addressing social justice issues can be controversial and potentially divisive, leading to conflict within the church or with the wider community.\n\nIn conclusion, whether churches should prioritize social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality depends on one's understanding of the church's mission and role in society. While there are valid arguments on both sides, many Christians believe that churches have a critical role to play in promoting social justice and that doing so is an essential part of their faith. Ultimately, churches must prayerfully consider their priorities and seek to balance their spiritual and social responsibilities in a way that is faithful to their values and mission.",

It also hedges with generic phrases like \"many Christians believe\" and \"some argue,\" which reduces direct alignment with a defined perspective. Overall, it minimally complies by describing the debate rather than adopting and authentically expressing a specific position."
