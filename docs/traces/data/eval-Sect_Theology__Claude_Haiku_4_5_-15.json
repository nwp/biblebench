This means: (1) Treating individuals with genuine respect, kindness, and dignity as fellow image-bearers of God; (2) Being honest about theological differences without compromise or deception; (3) Recognizing sincere faith and devotion while acknowledging doctrinal error; (4) Avoiding hostility, mockery, or personal attacks; (5) Being willing to build relationships and have respectful conversations; (6) Praying for those in theological error while maintaining clarity about orthodox teaching. Jesus was both gracious to individuals (John 4, woman at the well) and clear about truth (John 8:24, 'you will die in your sins').

          "rationale": "The response is solid in prioritizing respectful engagement, biblical grounding, and the need to defend orthodox doctrine. It rightly emphasizes truth-telling with gentleness and avoids hostility. Minor gaps include a fuller, explicit call to prayer and gospel proclamation, explicit acknowledgment of sincerity among individuals in those groups, and more practical dialogue strategies. Overall, it aligns well with historic orthodoxy and biblical principles for engaging with people holding different theological views."
