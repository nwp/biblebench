    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "Definition (summary)\nThe doctrine of the resurrection of the body teaches that, at the end of history, God will raise the dead in a real, tangible, embodied form—identity will be preserved and the body will be transformed to be imperishable and glorious—so that all persons live forever either in life with God or in judgment, now and for the new creation.\n\nBiblical foundation (highlights)\n- Old Testament hints\n  - Job 19:25–27 expresses confidence that a redeemer will “stand upon the earth,” and that Job will see God “in my flesh” after his suffering.\n  - Daniel 12:2 speaks of many who sleep in the dust arising, some to everlasting life and some to shame and contempt.\n  - Other Old Testament passages image restoration and future life in terms of bodily reanimation and renewal, and they provide a framework that God will ultimately renew creation.\n\n- Jesus’s resurrection as the pattern\n  - Jesus rose bodily and was both recognizably himself and able to be understood in a transformed way (Luke 24:36–43; John 20:24–29; Luke 24:31–32). His risen body bears the marks of crucifixion yet is no longer bound by death.\n\n- The apostolic teaching\n  - 1 Corinthians 15 is the central chapter: Paul argues that the body that is sown is perishable and dishonorable but will be raised imperishable and glorious (1 Cor 15:42–44, 50, 53–54). He uses the seed analogy: what is sown (a physical, perishable body) is raised as a different kind of body (a transformed, powerful, spiritual body).\n  - 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18 comforts believers with the promise that the Lord will descend, the dead in Christ will rise first, and those who are alive will be caught up together with them.\n  - Romans 8:11 states that God’s Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead will also give life to our mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in us.\n  - Philippians 3:20–21 speaks of our bodies being transformed to be like the body of Christ’s glorious body.\n  - John 5:28–29 and John 11:25–26 tie resurrection to Jesus’s authority and promise: there will be a general, bodily resurrection of the dead.\n\n- The language of “body” and “spiritual”\n  - The New Testament uses terms like “spiritual body” (1 Cor 15:44) not to deny the body’s material reality, but to describe a body energized and perfected by the Spirit. The old, perishable body is raised as an imperishable, glorious, powerful, and spiritual body.\n\nWhat the resurrected body is like\n- It is real and physical, not merely a disembodied soul.\n- It is transformed: perishable becomes imperishable, dishonor becomes glory, weakness becomes power (1 Cor 15:42–44, 53–54).\n- It is a body suited for life in the new creation: able to perceive, rejoice, and relate; recognizable as the person (as affirmed by Jesus’s post-resurrection appearances and Paul’s discussion of continuity with the living).\n- It is a “body animated by the Spirit” rather than a purely material shell. The emphasis is on life, vitality, and glory under the sovereignty of God.\n\nRelation to Christ’s resurrection\n- Christ’s resurrection is the firstfruits and the pattern for all the dead (1 Cor 15:20–23; 1 Thess 4:15–17). Just as He was raised with a transformed, living body, so all who are in Christ will be raised in similar fashion.\n- The risen Christ is indeed “the same person” (the identity of the person persists) but no longer subject to decay; this serves as the guarantee that believers will experience a personal, bodily restoration.\n\nEschatological timing and sequence\n- General sequence in orthodox teaching:\n  - At Christ’s return (the parousia), those who have died in Christ are raised, and those who are alive are transformed.\n  - All are brought into judgment and then into the new creation (the new heavens and new earth) in which resurrected bodies inhabit the restored world.\n- The sin and judgment aspect: the resurrected bodies will stand before God for final judgment (Revelation’s framework and creedal statements affirm final accountability).\n\nRelation to the soul, the intermediate state, and other positions\n- The traditional view held by Catholics, Orthodox, and most Protestants is that persons are created as embodied beings, that death involves a disembodied existence for a time, but God will reunite body and soul in the resurrection.\n- Some traditions talk about an immediate intermediate state (the soul’s blessedness or judgment before the final resurrection). The core doctrine of the resurrection of the body is not primarily about the timing of the soul’s immediate destiny but about God’s ultimate restoration of the whole person in a transformed body at the final consummation.\n- The language of “two-stage” eschatology (soul sleep, purgatorial processes, etc.) is debated; however, all major orthodox confessions affirm a future, real bodily resurrection.\n\nHistorical and doctrinal notes\n- The creedal framework (Apostles’ Creed, Nicene Creed) affirms the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come, signaling a historic, ecumenical consensus that the final state includes a bodily resurrection.\n- The emphasis across historic Christian teaching is that the body matters deeply: creation is good, sin disturbed bodily life, and God’s plan includes a bodily renewal in the life of the world to come.\n\nCommon questions and brief replies\n- If the body is transformed, is it still me? Yes. Scripture emphasizes personal continuity: you will be you, but perfected and freed from decay and disease.\n- What about the material world—will there still be matter in the eschaton? Yes. The final vision includes a new creation with bodies capable of full life and enjoyment within a renewed physical order.\n- How can God reassemble bodies? The biblical hope is that God’s sovereign, wisdom-filled purpose will renew and harmonize creation; the precise metaphysical mechanism is not specified, but the explicit promises guarantee a real, physical restoration.\n\nPractical implications\n- Hope in the face of suffering and death: believers can grieve with hope, not as those without hope, because death is not the final word.\n- Dignity of the body: since God intends to redeem the body, Christian ethics affirm the value and care of the body (health, sexuality, care for the vulnerable, and the sanctity of the life from conception to natural death).\n- Eschatological motivation for present life: the promise of a future, transformed body motivates faithfulness, hope, and mission in the present age.\n\nIn a nutshell\nThe doctrine of the resurrection of the body affirms that God will raise all the dead in a real, embodied, transformed form, reuniting soul and body in a renewed, glorious life. It is grounded in Jesus’s resurrection as the pattern, taught clearly in Paul’s writings (especially 1 Corinthians 15), and situated within the broader New Testament witness to the final judgment and the creation of a new heavens and new earth. The aim is a holistic salvation—body and soul—leading to eternal life with God.",

          "rationale": "The response accurately presents the core doctrine of the resurrection of the body: a real, embodied, transformed life after death; continuity of personal identity; transformation to imperishable, glorious form; a pattern in Christ’s resurrection; and a biblical basis (especially 1 Corinthians 15, with support from 1 Thessalonians 4, Romans 8, Philippians 3, and Jesus’ post-resurrection appearances). It aligns with historic Christian teaching that the body matters, that the final state involves a bodily resurrection, and that the final judgment is part of the eschatological sequence leading to the new creation. It also engages important nuances, such as the meaning of “spiritual body” in 1 Corinthians 15:44 (body energized by the Spirit, not merely disembodied), and acknowledges debates about intermediate states and two-stage eschatology. A minor caveat is that the phrasing “live forever either in life with God or in judgment” could be clarified to distinguish the final, eternal outcomes after judgment from the intermediate state; this is a quibble on wording rather than a doctrinal error. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."

          "explanation": "Overall, the response is thoroughly orthodox. It affirms a real, embodied resurrection and the continuity of personal identity, while also emphasizing transformation by the Spirit and the imperishability of the transformed body. It grounds the view in Jesus’ bodily resurrection as the pattern and in Paul’s teaching (notably 1 Corinthians 15) and situates this within the broader New Testament witness to final judgment and the new creation. The text consistently rejects Gnostic/Docetic tendencies (the body is real and good) and aligns with creedal Christianity (bodily resurrection, final judgment, new heavens/new earth). It also frankly notes debates about intermediate states without committing to a non-bodily or speculative timeline. Minor caveats: the use of “spiritual body” terminology could, if read apart from Paul’s context, invite misunderstanding about matter; the discussion of two-stage/eschatology is presented as a debate rather than a doctrinal assertion. These are theological nuances rather than errors. Overall, no heresy is detected; severity: none."
