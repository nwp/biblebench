    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",

Let me offer a framework that aims to be both principled and fair.\n\n## The Historical Orthodox Consensus\n\nOrthodox Christianity isn't defined by any single denomination but by the **ecumenical consensus** that emerged across the early centuries—what C.S. Lewis called \"mere Christianity\" and what Vincent of Lérins described as *\"what has been believed everywhere, always, by all.\"*\n\nThe core boundaries typically center on:\n\n### 1. **The Nature of God**\n- Classical Trinitarianism: One God in three co-equal, co-eternal Persons\n- Departures: Modalism (one Person in three modes), tritheism (three gods), subordinationism (Son/Spirit as lesser beings), or denial of Christ's full divinity\n\n### 2. **The Person of Christ**\n- Fully God and fully human, two natures in one Person (Chalcedonian definition)\n- Departures: Denying either nature, or claiming Jesus was a created being\n\n### 3. **The Gospel and Salvation**\n- Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work\n- Departures: Adding requirements that effectively make Christ's work insufficient\n\n### 4. **Scriptural Authority**\n- The Bible as the authoritative revelation of God\n- Departures: Elevating other texts to equal or superior status\n\n---\n\n## Why This Line-Drawing Is Necessary (But Difficult)\n\n**Legitimate reasons for boundaries:**\n- Jesus and the apostles themselves warned against false teaching (Matthew 7:15; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Peter 2:1)\n- Words must mean something—\"Christian\" loses coherence if infinitely elastic\n- Protecting people from spiritual harm\n\n**Necessary cautions:**\n- Majoring on minors has caused tremendous harm (excommunicating over secondary issues)\n- Power dynamics often corrupt boundary-enforcement\n- Humility: the church has sometimes been wrong about who's \"out\"\n\n---\n\n## A Proposed Framework\n\nI'd suggest distinguishing three categories:\n\n| Category | Description | Example Issues |\n|----------|-------------|----------------|\n| **Dogma** (essential) | Denying these places one outside historic Christianity | Trinity, deity of Christ, bodily resurrection |\n| **Doctrine** (important) | Christians disagree but remain Christian | Baptism mode, predestination, eschatology |\n| **Opinion** (negotiable) | Matters of wisdom and conscience | Worship style, political applications |\n\n---\n\n## Applying This Carefully\n\nA group falls outside orthodox Christianity when it **systematically denies the dogmatic core**, not when it:\n- Has unusual practices\n- Emphasizes neglected truths\n- Holds minority positions on secondary matters\n- Is culturally unfamiliar\n\n**Red flags** (not proof, but warrant examination):\n- New revelation that contradicts or supersedes Scripture\n- A different Jesus (pre-existent angel, purely human teacher, one god among many)\n- Salvation requiring something other than/beyond Christ's finished work\n- Exclusive claims to be the only true church with essential truths others lack\n\n---\n\n## A Word on Posture\n\nWe can hold firm boundaries while maintaining:\n- **Epistemic humility**: \"This is the historic consensus and why it matters\"\n- **Charitable interpretation**: Understanding groups as they understand themselves\n- **Relational respect**: People in heterodox groups are image-bearers, often sincere seekers\n- **Self-examination**: Our own traditions have blind spots too\n\nThe goal isn't to win arguments but to preserve the gospel that actually saves and to love people enough to speak truthfully.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to apply this framework to any specific movement or teaching?",

It correctly notes that Christian terminology alone does not guarantee orthodoxy and provides a practical framework (dogma vs. doctrine vs. opinion) for evaluating groups. It cites biblical warrants (Matt 7:15; Gal 1:8–9; 2 Pet 2:1) and appeals to traditional formulations (Vincent of Lérins, C.S. Lewis’ “mere Christianity”), while emphasizing humility, charitable interpretation, and relational caution. Minor caveats exist in the simplification of certain historical nuances (e.g., subordinationism versus other non-orthodox Christological positions), but these do not undermine the overall accuracy or usefulness of the framework."
