    "expected": "The Trinity is the Christian doctrine that God exists as three distinct persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) who are coequal and coeternal, yet remain one God in essence and substance. This is a mystery that transcends human comprehension - not three gods (tritheism) nor one person in three modes (modalism), but one God in three persons who are distinct yet inseparable in their divine nature and work.",
    "output": "# The Doctrine of the Trinity\n\n## Core Definition\n\nThe doctrine of the Trinity affirms that God is **one in essence** yet **three in persons**: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each person is fully God, possessing the complete divine nature, yet they are distinct persons, not simply modes or manifestations of one person.\n\n## Key Formulation\n\n- **One What**: One God, one divine essence/nature\n- **Three Whos**: Three distinct persons\n- Each person is fully God, not one-third of God\n- The persons are co-eternal and co-equal\n\n## Biblical Foundation\n\n### One God (Monotheism)\n- Deuteronomy 6:4 - \"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one\"\n- Isaiah 45:5 - \"I am the LORD, and there is no other\"\n\n### Three Divine Persons\n\n**The Father is God** (1 Corinthians 8:6)\n\n**The Son is God**:\n- John 1:1 - \"The Word was God\"\n- John 20:28 - Thomas calls Jesus \"My Lord and my God\"\n- Colossians 2:9 - \"In him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily\"\n\n**The Spirit is God**:\n- Acts 5:3-4 - Lying to the Holy Spirit is lying to God\n- 1 Corinthians 2:10-11 - The Spirit knows the depths of God\n\n### Trinitarian Formulas\n- Matthew 28:19 - Baptism in the name (singular) of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\n- 2 Corinthians 13:14 - The trinitarian benediction\n\n## Understanding the Mystery\n\n### Important Distinctions\nThe Trinity is **not**:\n- Three gods (tritheism)\n- One person with three masks or modes (modalism)\n- One God divided into three parts\n\n### Helpful Analogies (with limitations)\nWhile all analogies fail, some point to aspects of the truth:\n- **The sun**: one sun with light, heat, and radiation (but these aren't persons)\n- **Human personhood**: mind, will, and emotions in one being (but this leans toward modalism)\n- **The triangle**: three corners, one shape (but corners aren't persons)\n\n## Theological Significance\n\n1. **Salvation requires the Trinity**: The Father sends, the Son redeems, the Spirit applies salvation\n2. **Love is inherent to God's nature**: Eternal love exists between the persons\n3. **Reveals God's complexity**: God is unity in diversity\n4. **Foundation for community**: Reflects relationality within the Godhead\n\n## Historical Development\n\nThe Church formalized Trinitarian doctrine against heresies:\n- **Nicaea (325 AD)**: Affirmed the full deity of the Son\n- **Constantinople (381 AD)**: Affirmed the full deity of the Spirit\n- **Chalcedon (451 AD)**: Clarified the person of Christ\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Trinity is a **mystery to be embraced, not a problem to be solved**. It's beyond human comprehension but not contradictory—God is one *in one sense* (essence) and three *in another sense* (persons). This doctrine emerges from Scripture's testimony and defines orthodox Christian faith. We worship one God who exists eternally as three persons in perfect, loving relationship.",

          "rationale": "Overall, the response accurately presents the classical Christian doctrine of the Trinity: one God in essence (or one divine nature) existing eternally as three distinct persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), with each person fully God, coequal and coeternal, and not reducible to modes or to multiple gods. It aligns with key biblical data and historic confessional statements by citing Scriptural foundations for the divinity of the Father (1 Cor 8:6), the Son (John 1:1; John 20:28; Col 2:9), and the Spirit (Acts 5:3-4; 1 Cor 2:10-11); it also cites Matthew 28:19 and the 2 Cor 13:14 benediction as Trinitarian formulas. It correctly rejects tritheism and modalism and recognizes the mystery involved in the doctrine, while acknowledging that analogies have limits. The discussion of the Trinity’s theological significance (salvation, love within God, relational unity) and a brief historical note (Nicaea, Constantinople, Chalcedon) are appropriate and standard within orthodox teaching. The response also notes the economic (works) and relational aspects of the Trinity, which points toward a helpful nuance about how the Trinity operates in creation and redemption. Potentially missing nuance (not a doctrinal error): the article does not explicitly discuss the eternal relations of origin within the Trinity (the Father as unmoved origin, the Son eternally begotten, the Spirit proceeding), nor does it address the immanent vs. economic Trinity in depth or the Filioque clause. It also does not explicitly articulate perichoresis (the mutual indwelling) as a technical term, though its idea is conveyed. Despite these omissions, the core accuracy and alignment with historic orthodoxy are strong, justifying a high score."

          "explanation": "The response accurately articulates orthodox Trinitarian doctrine: one God in essence, three distinct persons; each person fully God; Scripture supports (e.g., Deut 6:4; John 1:1; Matt 28:19; Acts 5:3-4; 2 Cor 13:14). It correctly rejects common heresies (tritheism, modalism) and uses cautions about inadequate analogies. The theological significance (economic Trinitarian activity in salvation, relational love, and community) aligns with traditional teaching. A minor clarificational point: Chalcedon (451 AD) is primarily about Christology (the two natures of Christ) rather than a definitive statement on the Triune God, though it is historically linked to broader Trinitarian development. The statement that “salvation requires the Trinity” reflects orthodox teaching about the triune economy of salvation, though it isn’t a single explicit scriptural formula. Overall, there are no orthodox errors; the content adheres to historic Christian orthodoxy."
