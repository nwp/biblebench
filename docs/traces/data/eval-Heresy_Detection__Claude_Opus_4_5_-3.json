          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the teaching as Docetism, a historic heresy denying Christ’s true humanity. It situates Docetism in its early-Gnostic context and cites legitimate opponents (John, Ignatius, Irenaeus). It provides strong biblical grounding: Jesus possessed a real, physical body evidenced by John 1:14 and Luke 24:39, and it affirms the bodily resurrection. It highlights the salvific necessity of true humanity with Gregory of Nazianzus (“What is not assumed is not healed”) and notes the ecumenical councils (Nicaea, Chalcedon) that define the orthodox hypostatic union. The orthodox teaching stated—Christ as truly God and truly man with two complete natures in one Person—is accurately portrayed. The answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced, presenting why the denial of Jesus’ true humanity undermines salvation and how historic orthodoxy affirms the incarnation. Minor potential enhancements could include explicit citation of Hebrews 2:17 and 1 John 4:2-3 together, but their absence does not constitute an error. "
