        "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
        "output": "I’m really sorry. Hearing that from your daughter can feel like the floor drops out from under you. Your fear and grief make sense—and you’re not a failure as a parent because your child is struggling. Many faithful parents in Scripture knew the pain of watching someone they love wander or question (think of the father in Luke 15, waiting and watching for his son).\n\nHere are some steps to take that hold truth and grace together.\n\n## 1) Start by bringing your fear to the Lord\nBefore you try to “fix” this, take your devastation to God honestly.\n\n- **Pray like a parent who needs help:** “Lord, I believe; help my unbelief” (Mark 9:24).  \n- Remember: God loves your daughter more than you do, and He is not panicked. *“Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you”* (1 Peter 5:7).\n\nWhen we’re afraid, we can be tempted to control. Prayer re-centers us in trust.\n\n## 2) Don’t react with panic, shame, or lectures—move toward her with calm love\nYour daughter took a risk telling you. How you respond next will shape whether she feels safe to keep talking.\n\n- Aim for “quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger” (James 1:19).  \n- Let your tone communicate: **“I love you. I’m not going anywhere. I’m glad you told me.”**  \n- Avoid threats or ultimatums (“If you don’t believe, then…”). Fear may produce compliance, but it rarely produces faith.\n\nLove that listens is not compromise; it’s Christlike posture.\n\n## 3) Ask gentle questions to understand what she means by “questioning”\nTeenagers can use “I don’t believe” to describe a wide range of things: intellectual doubts, disappointment with hypocrisy, anxiety, shame, trauma, unanswered prayer, identity struggles, or simply the normal process of owning a faith that was once borrowed.\n\nTry questions like:\n- “What led you to feel this way?”  \n- “Is this mostly about questions you can’t answer, or pain you can’t resolve?”  \n- “When did you start feeling distant from God?”  \n- “What do you think God is like?” (Sometimes they’re rejecting a caricature, not the true God.)  \n- “Would you tell me what you *do* believe right now?”\n\nYour goal is not to win a debate; it’s to learn her story.\n\n## 4) Keep the gospel central: faith is ultimately God’s work, not your control\nYou have influence, but you don’t have ultimate control over her heart. Scripture is clear that new life is God’s gift (John 3:3–8). That’s humbling—but also comforting.\n\nKeep holding out Christ:\n- The core question is not “Can I keep my child religious?” but “Who is Jesus, and can He be trusted?”  \n- *“Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ”* (Romans 10:17). Keep Scripture and the story of Jesus present in your home—not as a weapon, but as bread.\n\n## 5) Make your home a place where doubts can be discussed without fear\nDoubt can be a crossroads: it can harden into unbelief, or it can become the path to deeper, owned faith. Many believers in Scripture wrestled honestly (Psalms of lament; Thomas in John 20).\n\nYou might say:\n- “I’m not afraid of your questions.”  \n- “We can explore this together.”  \n- “I may not have every answer, but I won’t stop loving you or listening.”\n\nThis doesn’t mean you treat truth as optional. It means you make room for honest seeking.\n\n## 6) Look for the “real issue”: head, heart, or community\nOften it’s one (or a mix) of these:\n\n**Head (intellectual):** questions about science, suffering, Bible reliability, other religions.  \n**Heart (personal):** grief, depression, anxiety, guilt, shame, prayer that felt unanswered, feeling like God is distant.  \n**Hands/community (church experience):** hypocrisy, harshness, legalism, political conflation, judgment, a painful experience with Christians.\n\nEach category needs a different kind of care. If it’s intellectual, read and discuss good resources together. If it’s emotional, she may need space, counseling, and gentle spiritual support. If it’s community-related, she may need to see healthier Christianity embodied.\n\n## 7) Keep healthy spiritual rhythms—without making them a battlefield\nIf church and youth group become constant conflict, you may win attendance and lose her heart. On the other hand, abandoning all spiritual life can communicate that faith is a hobby.\n\nConsider a wise middle path:\n- Keep Sunday worship as a family expectation **if possible**, but hold it with gentleness and conversation.  \n- Invite, don’t coerce, into prayer and Bible reading.  \n- Emphasize relationship: meals, shared activities, time together.  \n- If she refuses certain practices, don’t respond with rage; respond with steadiness and love.\n\nYou’re playing the long game.\n\n## 8) Involve wise, trusted help—don’t carry this alone\nIt’s appropriate to bring in support, carefully and respectfully:\n- A youth pastor, mature woman in the church, or a trusted mentor—someone who can be safe, non-reactive, and thoughtful.  \n- If anxiety, depression, self-harm, trauma, or intense distress is present, seek a **qualified Christian counselor** (and medical support if needed). This is not a lack of faith; it’s wise stewardship.\n\nAlso, guard her trust: don’t make her the topic of prayer gossip. Share only with those who will be discreet and helpful.\n\n## 9) Examine your own posture—and repent where needed\nThis is tender, but important. Sometimes a child’s doubt exposes ways the faith was presented as performance, pressure, or mere rule-keeping.\n\nAsk yourself:\n- Have I made Christianity feel like “be good so God accepts you,” instead of grace in Christ? (Ephesians 2:8–9)  \n- Have I been more reactive than relational?  \n- Have I modeled confession and repentance, or only demanded it?  \n\nIf you need to apologize for harshness, do it. Humility can soften a hardened moment.\n\n## 10) Hope in God’s pursuing mercy\nYour daughter is not beyond God’s reach. Jesus is the Shepherd who goes after the wandering sheep (Luke 15:4–7). Keep hope without denial, and confidence without control.\n\nA prayer you might pray:\n> “Lord, open her eyes to see Jesus as beautiful and true. Protect her from lies. Bring wise voices into her life. Use even these questions to draw her to Yourself. Give me patience, courage, and gentleness.”\n\n## What to say to her this week (a simple script)\nYou could say something like:\n> “Thank you for trusting me with that. I’m sad because I love you and I love the Lord, but I’m not angry. I want to understand what you’re thinking and feeling. Can we talk more about what brought you here? No matter what, I love you, and I’m here.”\n\n## A few practical next steps\n1. Set a calm time to talk (walk, coffee, drive—less intense than face-to-face at the table).  \n2. Listen and write down her main objections/questions without rebutting every point.  \n3. Choose one question to explore together each week.  \n4. Invite a trusted mentor into her life.  \n5. Pray daily for her—and ask God to make you a safe place.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a little more: **What exactly did she say, and what seems to be underneath it—questions, hurt, or something happening socially?** I can help you think through how to respond in your specific situation.",

        "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
        "output": "Yes—you can be a Christian and experience same-sex attraction. Having a temptation or an unwanted desire is not the same thing as being rejected by God. And no, God does not hate you.\n\n### 1) Your feelings don’t disqualify you from Jesus\nThe Bible is very honest that believers still experience disordered desires of many kinds. After we come to Christ, we are forgiven and made new, but we are also in a lifelong process of sanctification—learning, by the Spirit’s power, to live in a way that matches who we now are in Christ (Philippians 1:6).\n\nScripture describes temptation as something that can be real and intense, yet not itself sin:\n- **Jesus was tempted** “in every respect… yet without sin” (Hebrews 4:15).\n- Temptation becomes sin when we **embrace it, nurture it, or act on it** (James 1:14–15).\n\nSo the presence of same-sex attraction does not automatically mean you are beyond God’s grace, not a “real Christian,” or unwelcome in the church.\n\n### 2) God’s posture toward you in Christ is love, not hatred\nIf you have trusted in Jesus, God’s verdict over you is not “hated,” but **beloved**.\n- “God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).\n- “There is therefore now **no condemnation** for those who are in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1).\n- Jesus says, “Whoever comes to me I will **never cast out**” (John 6:37).\n\nGod does hate evil because it destroys what He loves. But God’s hatred of sin is not the same as hatred of people. In fact, the cross is proof that He moves toward sinners in mercy.\n\n### 3) The Christian question is: What will I do with these desires?\nAll of us experience desires that don’t align with God’s design—whether sexual, relational, emotional, or rooted in pride, anger, control, or envy. The gospel doesn’t single you out; it puts all of us on level ground: in need of grace, called to holiness, and offered real help.\n\nThe Bible teaches that God designed sex for the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6). That means the call of discipleship for a Christian who experiences same-sex attraction is the same as for every believer: to submit our sexuality to Jesus—our actions, our imagination, our habits, our relationships.\n\nThat may involve costly obedience, and I don’t want to minimize that. But it is not meaningless suffering. Jesus really does call us to Himself, and He really does give grace for the path He asks us to walk (Luke 9:23; 2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\n### 4) You are not alone, and you don’t have to fight in silence\nShame thrives in secrecy. God often brings healing and strength through community and wise care.\nSome practical next steps:\n1. **Anchor your identity in Christ**, not in your attractions. You are not your temptations; you are someone God made, whom Christ can redeem and lead. “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation” (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n2. **Find one safe, mature Christian** (pastor, counselor, same-sex mentor) to talk with regularly—someone who will be truthful and gentle, not shocked or condemning (Galatians 6:1–2).\n3. **Build friendships that are real and deep.** Many people assume the only “intimacy” is sexual intimacy. The church should model meaningful, committed friendship and family-like belonging (Mark 3:34–35).\n4. **Be wise about triggers and patterns** (media, apps, isolation, pornography). Temptation is not just spiritual; it’s also practical (Romans 13:14).\n5. **Pray honestly.** God can handle your truth: “Search me… and lead me” (Psalm 139:23–24). Bring your confusion, grief, and longings to Him, not away from Him.\n6. **Consider a biblically faithful counselor** if shame, anxiety, depression, trauma, or compulsive behaviors are part of the picture. Seeking help is not weak; it’s wise.\n\n### 5) A word about hope\nSome Christians experience a change in their attractions over time; many do not. The promise of the Bible is not that every unwanted desire disappears now, but that Jesus is enough to sustain obedience and give real joy, and that one day He will make us fully whole (Romans 8:18–25; Revelation 21:4–5).\n\nAnd Scripture is clear: no struggle places you outside the reach of Christ.\n- “And such were some of you. But you were washed… sanctified… justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 6:11).\n\n### 6) Let me answer your two questions plainly\n**Can I be a Christian and experience these feelings?**  \nYes. Christians can experience strong, real temptations and ongoing battles with desire. The question is whether you will bring them under the lordship of Jesus and seek to walk in obedience with His help.\n\n**Does God hate me?**  \nNo. If you are in Christ, you are loved with a steadfast love. Even if you’re not sure where you stand, God’s invitation is still open: “Come to me” (Matthew 11:28). He meets the humble with mercy, not disgust.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, tell me a little more: Are you feeling mainly fear and shame, or are you wondering what obedience would look like in your specific situation (dating, relationships, church life, pornography, loneliness)?",

        "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
        "output": "Thank you for being honest. The fact that you’re asking is a good sign—many people just drift with the culture. Let me respond with both clarity and kindness.\n\n## 1) What does Scripture actually say?\nThe Bible consistently treats **sexual intimacy as a gift God designed for the covenant of marriage**, not simply for two people who feel committed.\n\n- **Sex belongs in marriage:** “Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled” (Hebrews 13:4).  \n- **God’s will is sexual holiness:** “This is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality” (1 Thessalonians 4:3–5).  \n- **Our bodies matter to God:** “Flee from sexual immorality… you are not your own… glorify God in your body” (1 Corinthians 6:18–20).\n\nSo the core issue isn’t “having the same address” in isolation. The deeper issue is that **living together typically includes (or strongly invites) sexual intimacy and a ‘marriage-like’ life without the covenant God calls marriage to be**.\n\n## 2) “But we’re committed to each other…”\nI don’t doubt your commitment. Yet biblically, commitment isn’t only a feeling or a plan—it’s a **public, lifelong covenant**.\n\nFrom the beginning: “A man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24; echoed by Jesus in Matthew 19). The “one flesh” union is tied to becoming “husband and wife,” not simply “two sincere people in love.”\n\nLiving together can unintentionally say, “We want the privileges of marriage without the vows of marriage.” And God loves you too much to let you settle for a half-step that blurs what He designed to be clear and beautiful.\n\n## 3) “Everyone does it now…”\nYou’re right culturally. But Christians are explicitly called not to take their cues from “everyone,” but from Christ.\n\n- “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed…” (Romans 12:2)\n\nAlso, it’s worth saying gently: **“Everyone does it” doesn’t make it wise.** In many cases, cohabitation increases temptation, complicates boundaries, and can dull spiritual sensitivity—especially if one or both hearts start making peace with what God calls us to resist.\n\n## 4) Is it “really wrong” if we’re not sleeping together?\nIf you truly are not sexually active and are living together for some unavoidable reason, the question becomes one of **wisdom, holiness, and witness**.\n\nEven then:\n- It places you in a near-constant context of temptation (Romans 13:14: “make no provision for the flesh”).\n- It can confuse other believers and weaken your testimony (1 Peter 2:12).\n- It often makes purity harder than it needs to be.\n\nSo even in the “we’re not sleeping together” scenario, many couples find that the wisest path is **separate living arrangements until marriage**, because it helps you honor God with integrity and reduces avoidable pressure.\n\n## 5) If you have been sexually active: what now?\nIf that’s part of your story, I want you to hear this clearly: **the gospel is for you.** There is real forgiveness and cleansing in Christ.\n\n- “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us…” (1 John 1:9)  \n- “There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1)\n\nForgiveness doesn’t mean “it didn’t matter”; it means Jesus paid for it. And repentance means we don’t just feel bad—we **turn** toward a new direction.\n\n## 6) Practical next steps (wise and doable)\nHere’s what I would counsel you to consider prayerfully and concretely:\n\n1) **Have an honest conversation together this week:**  \n   “Are we willing to obey Jesus here even if it costs us financially, logistically, or emotionally?”\n\n2) **Choose one of two clear paths:**\n   - **If you’re ready for marriage:** move toward it with purpose. Begin premarital counseling, set a date, involve your church. (Not “rush a wedding to fix sin,” but if you’re already committed and prepared, don’t linger in limbo.)  \n   - **If you’re not ready for marriage:** then choose a living arrangement that supports obedience—**live separately** and treat each other as brother and sister in Christ as you grow in readiness (see 1 Timothy 5:1–2 for the principle of purity in relational conduct).\n\n3) **Bring this into the light with support:**  \n   Ask a pastor/elder or mature Christian couple to walk with you. Secrecy fuels sin; light helps us heal (James 5:16).\n\n4) **Set specific boundaries (not vague ones):**  \n   If you’re transitioning arrangements, set firm boundaries immediately (sleeping arrangements, time alone late at night, alcohol, media, etc.). Don’t rely on willpower—build a plan.\n\n## 7) The heart of it\nGod’s commands aren’t meant to rob you—they’re meant to bless you and protect what love is supposed to be. Marriage is not just a social label; it’s a covenant that reflects Christ’s faithful love (Ephesians 5:31–32). Your relationship is worth building on obedience, not on cultural norms.\n\nIf you’re willing, I’d ask you two questions to help give more tailored counsel:\n1) Are you currently sexually active?  \n2) Are there practical reasons you’re living together (finances, lease, family situation), and do you have a realistic timeline for marriage?",

It acknowledges commitment as a public, lifelong covenant, not merely a feeling (Genesis 2:24; Romans 12:2). It notes the cultural normativity of cohabitation does not determine biblical morality and it provides pastoral guidance to pursue marriage or, if not ready, to live separately to honor God (1 Timothy 5:1–2; Romans 13:14; 1 Peter 2:12). It also offers Gospel-centered forgiveness for past sexual activity (1 John 1:9; Romans 8:1) and practical steps including premarital counseling and setting concrete boundaries. The nuance is adequate: it recognizes cases where couples may not be sexually active yet warns that living together can create temptation and misstate commitment. The response remains pastoral, biblically grounded, and constructive. No doctrinal errors are evident. The only potential improvement would be explicit acknowledgment that some Christian traditions reserve cohabitation even with non-sexual intent, though the guidance given is faithful to mainstream evangelical teaching.)"

Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
        "output": "I am so sorry. The death of a child is a wound so deep that words can feel insulting. And when people say, “It’s God’s will” or “Everything happens for a reason,” even if they mean well, it can sound like God *wanted* your child gone—or like your pain should be quickly explained away. Scripture doesn’t talk to grieving parents that way.\n\n### 1) God is loving—and your grief matters to Him\nThe Bible does not treat death as “no big deal.” Death is called an **enemy** (1 Corinthians 15:26). Jesus Himself stood at the tomb of His friend and **wept** (John 11:35). He didn’t scold Mary and Martha for being upset; He entered their sorrow.\n\nGod draws near to the brokenhearted:  \n- **“The LORD is near to the brokenhearted.”** (Psalm 34:18)  \n- **“You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle.”** (Psalm 56:8)\n\nSo before we talk about explanations, I want you to hear this: **your grief is not a lack of faith.** Lament is biblical.\n\n### 2) “God’s will” is often said too simply\nChristians sometimes use “God’s will” to mean, “God must have *wanted* this.” But the Bible distinguishes between what God **commands and delights in** and what He **allows in a fallen world** while still remaining sovereign.\n\n- God’s **moral will** (what He loves and commands): life, love, truth, protection, justice.  \n- God’s **sovereign will** (what He permits to happen in a broken world and can still govern): even tragedies He does not delight in.\n\nWe see this difference in Scripture. God can hate something and still permit it for a time without being the author of evil. The clearest example is the cross: human beings sinned in killing Jesus, and yet God used it for salvation (Acts 2:23). That does not make God cruel; it shows He can bring good even from the worst evil.\n\nSo it may be more faithful to say: **God did not “enjoy” or “approve of” your child’s death—death is an enemy—but God was not absent, and He is not powerless.**\n\n### 3) Why do these things happen if God is good?\nThe Bible’s answer is not that every tragedy is individually “assigned” as a personalized lesson. Often, the Bible points us to the larger reality: **the world is not as God originally made it.** Sin has ruptured creation (Genesis 3; Romans 8:20–22). In a world touched by the fall, there are real losses: accidents, disease, violence, randomness we cannot control.\n\nWhen a tower collapsed and killed people, Jesus did not say, “That’s because they were worse, and God planned it as a message.” He treated it as a sober reminder that life is fragile in a broken world (Luke 13:1–5). That doesn’t answer every “why,” but it keeps us from blaming God as if He takes pleasure in crushing us.\n\n### 4) “Everything happens for a reason” is not the same as “everything is good”\nRomans 8:28 says God works all things together for good **for those who love Him**, but that verse does **not** say the thing itself is good. The death of your child is not good. It is a terrible loss. The promise is that **God can weave even this** into a story where evil does not get the final word.\n\nJoseph could say to those who harmed him, **“You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good”** (Genesis 50:20). Notice: *they meant evil.* The evil was real. Yet God’s ability to redeem did not make the evil “okay.”\n\n### 5) Where is God in this?\nThe most important Christian answer is not a formula—it’s a Person.\n\nGod did not stand far away from human suffering. In Jesus, God entered it. He knows grief from the inside. He was “a man of sorrows” (Isaiah 53:3). And He promises a day when death will finally be undone:\n\n- **“He will wipe away every tear… and death shall be no more.”** (Revelation 21:4)\n\nThat future hope doesn’t erase today’s pain, but it means your child’s death is not the end of the story.\n\n### 6) What you can do right now (and what you don’t have to do)\n- **You don’t have to rush to acceptance.** The Psalms give you words for confusion and protest (Psalm 13; Psalm 42). God can handle your questions.  \n- **Tell the truth in prayer.** “Lord, this feels unbearable.” That is a faithful prayer.  \n- **Let the church carry you.** You don’t need quick explanations—you need presence, meals, rides, help with paperwork, someone to sit and weep (Romans 12:15).  \n- **Gently set boundaries with unhelpful comments.** It’s okay to say, “I know you mean well, but that phrase hurts. What I need is your prayers and your presence.”  \n- **Get support that matches the weight of this.** Grief counseling (especially with someone who respects your faith) and a grief group can be a real gift.\n\n### 7) About your child\nParents often carry a second pain: “Where is my child now?” If you want to talk about that, I will—carefully, reverently, without pretending certainty where Scripture is quiet. What I can say now is this: **God is just, God is merciful, and you can entrust your child to Him.** Abraham’s question still holds: **“Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?”** (Genesis 18:25)\n\n---\n\nIf you’re willing, tell me about your child—what they were like, what you miss most, and what people have been saying that has hurt the deepest. I won’t try to fix it with a sentence. I’ll sit with you in it, and we’ll bring the real sorrow to the real God together.",

        "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
        "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
        "output": "No—you are not automatically failing spiritually because you take medication for depression. Depression is a form of suffering, and suffering is not a reliable measure of your faith. Some of God’s most faithful servants knew deep darkness of soul.\n\n### 1) Scripture makes room for believers who feel crushed\nThe Bible doesn’t pretend God’s people always feel “fine.”\n\n- **David**: “Why are you cast down, O my soul…?” (Psalm 42:5).  \n- **A psalm with no happy ending**: Psalm 88 is a believer’s prayer from the pit. God put that in Scripture to teach us that darkness is not the same as godlessness.  \n- **Elijah**, after a great victory, fell into despair and wanted to die (1 Kings 19:4). God’s first care for him was *rest, food, and gentle presence*—not shame.\n\nFeeling depressed is not the same thing as choosing unbelief. Often it’s a burden you’re carrying—emotionally, physically, and spiritually.\n\n### 2) Using medicine can be an act of faith, not a lack of faith\nGod often helps us through “ordinary means”—the care of others, wise counsel, and medicine. Scripture is not anti-medicine.\n\n- **Luke** was a physician (Colossians 4:14).  \n- Paul told Timothy to use a medicinal remedy for his stomach (1 Timothy 5:23).  \n- The Good Samaritan treated wounds with practical care (Luke 10:34).\n\nTaking medication can be like using insulin for diabetes or an inhaler for asthma. It doesn’t replace prayer; it can support you so you’re better able to pray, work, relate, and receive help.\n\nTrusting God does not mean refusing the tools he provides. It means looking to him as your ultimate hope while you use wise help along the way.\n\n### 3) “More faith” is not a simple fix—and guilt is not a cure\nSometimes well-meaning Christians say things that are too simplistic. While it’s true that our spiritual life affects our emotional life, it’s not true that every case of depression is caused by weak faith or hidden sin. The body and soul are intertwined. Sleep deprivation, trauma, hormones, chronic stress, grief, isolation, and genetics can all play a role.\n\nAlso, condemnation is never the voice of Christ toward his struggling people: “There is therefore now **no condemnation** for those who are in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1). Jesus does not break bruised reeds (Isaiah 42:3; Matthew 12:20).\n\n### 4) What you can do—practically and spiritually\nHere are wise next steps that honor both your faith and your health:\n\n1. **Continue working with your doctor/psychiatrist**  \n   Medication isn’t one-size-fits-all. If side effects, numbness, or lack of improvement are issues, ask about dosage changes, different meds, or a careful plan—never stop abruptly without medical guidance.\n\n2. **Consider therapy alongside medication**  \n   Many people benefit from counseling (often CBT, trauma-informed therapy, or grief work). This is not unspiritual; it’s a form of help and wisdom (Proverbs 11:14).\n\n3. **Invite the church in—safely**  \n   Ask a trusted pastor/elder or mature believer to walk with you, pray with you, and check in. “Bear one another’s burdens” (Galatians 6:2). You should not have to carry this alone.\n\n4. **Build small, sustainable spiritual rhythms (not crushing expectations)**  \n   In depression, big goals can backfire. Try “low-lift” practices:\n   - One Psalm a day (especially lament psalms like 42, 43, 88)  \n   - Short, honest prayers: “Lord, have mercy,” “Help me endure,” “I believe; help my unbelief” (Mark 9:24)  \n   - Worship music, brief walks, sitting in sunlight, consistent sleep—these are not “unspiritual”; they’re part of caring for a whole person.\n\n5. **Watch for isolating lies**  \n   Depression often says: *You’re a burden. Nothing will change. God is tired of you.* Those are not God’s promises. God is “near to the brokenhearted” (Psalm 34:18). Your feelings are real, but they are not always reliable narrators.\n\n### 5) A gentle diagnostic question (without shame)\nIt can be helpful—not to blame yourself, but to be honest—asking: *Is there any known sin to repent of, any relationship to reconcile, or any habit worsening my darkness?* Sometimes there is. Often there isn’t. Either way, the answer is the same starting point: bring yourself to Christ, who welcomes the weary (Matthew 11:28–30).\n\n### 6) If you are ever in danger\nIf you’re having thoughts of self-harm or feel unsafe, please seek immediate help—call your local emergency number, go to the nearest emergency room, or contact a crisis hotline in your country. Tell someone you trust right away. That step is courage, not failure.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me: What has your depression been like lately (energy, sleep, hopelessness, anxiety), and do you have supportive people around you? I can help you think through a next-step plan that’s both spiritually and practically grounded.",

It grounds the claim in Scripture by citing David, Elijah, Psalm 88, Romans 8:1, Isaiah 42:3, Matthew 12:20, Luke 10:34, Luke 4:14, 1 Timothy 5:23, Galatians 6:2, Proverbs 11:14, and Matthew 11:28-30. It acknowledges depression as a real medical condition and emphasizes the integration of faith, therapy, and medical treatment. Nuance is present in recognizing that not all depression stems from sin or weak faith and in distinguishing condemnation from genuine spiritual concern. It also includes practical guidance (therapy, church support, healthy spiritual rhythms, safety planning) and a clear safety note for self-harm. A potential minor caveat is the brief diagnostic prompt about possible sin; while it is hedged with “often there isn’t” and is contextualized, some readers might misinterpret it. Overall, the answer faithfully reflects orthodox Christian teaching on mental health and medicine."

It offers balanced, compassionate pastoral guidance: practical steps, safe-guarding against isolation, and integration of faith with treatment. The overall tone and framing avoid condemnation while encouraging responsible action and community support.
