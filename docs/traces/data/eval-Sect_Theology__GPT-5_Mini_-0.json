    "input": "A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches: 'As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become.' Is this consistent with orthodox Christian theology? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "Short answer\nNo — the couplet “As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become” as taught in much Latter‑day Saint (LDS) teaching is not consistent with historic, orthodox Christian doctrine of God. Although there is a superficial similarity in language about “becoming like God,” the underlying meanings are substantially different. The LDS statement implies that God once had a beginning as a man and that humans can become gods in the same way God is God; classical Christianity affirms God’s uncreated, eternal, and transcendent nature and understands human “deification” (theosis) as a participation in God’s life by grace without becoming divine by nature.\n\nWhat the LDS couplet means in LDS theology\n- The phrase is associated with Joseph Smith, the King Follett discourse, and later leaders (and a famous couplet of Lorenzo Snow). It is usually taken to teach two things:\n  1. Heavenly Father was once a mortal man who progressed to godhood (an origin to God).\n  2. Faithful humans can “progress” to exaltation and become gods and goddesses — eventually inheriting divine attributes, authority, and the capacity to procreate spirit children, etc.\n- Core ideas include “eternal progression,” an anthropomorphic and embodied Heavenly Father, and a plurality of exalted gods (though LDS rhetoric varies on details).\n\nWhat historic/orthodox Christianity teaches about God\n- God is uncreated, self‑existent (aseity), eternal, immutable in essence, and utterly distinct from creatures (Creator/creature distinction). Scriptures and the creeds affirm this (e.g., Exodus 3:14; John 1; Hebrews 1; Nicene Creed: “begotten, not made”).\n- The Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one God in three persons. The Father is not a created or formerly mortal being.\n- The classic doctrine of “deification” or theosis (especially in Eastern Orthodoxy, also present in patristic and some Catholic language) teaches that Christians are called to share in the divine life by grace (cf. 2 Peter 1:4; Athanasius’s famous line, “God became man that man might become god”). But this participation:\n  - Is a gracious sharing in God’s life and energies, not an ontological absorption into God’s essence.\n  - Leaves intact the Creator/creature distinction: humans do not become God in God’s essential being (they do not become uncreated or turn into the ontological kind “God”).\n  - Is rooted in what Christ accomplished by incarnation and sanctification, not in a prior god’s becoming a man.\n\nPoints of agreement (surface and genuine)\n- Both traditions affirm that humans are created in God’s image and called to a profound union with God.\n- Both use language of transformation into Godlikeness: holiness, sanctification, and fellowship with God are central.\n- Both reject pantheism (God is not simply the world); both emphasize moral perfection and conformity to God as a goal.\n\nMajor points of departure\n1. God’s beginning and aseity\n   - LDS: God once was a man (had a beginning). God allegedly advanced to his present state.\n   - Orthodox Christianity: God is unoriginated, without beginning. To say “God once was a man” contradicts classical theism’s claim that God is not a creature and never had a beginning.\n\n2. Creator/creature distinction\n   - LDS exaltation doctrine tends to blur or reject a strict ontological separation between Creator and creature (creatures can become gods).\n   - Orthodox Christianity maintains a firm distinction: creatures may participate in God’s life but do not become God by nature.\n\n3. The Trinity and God’s nature\n   - LDS understanding of the Godhead typically treats Father, Son, and Spirit as distinct exalted beings (and the Father as embodied), not the classical doctrine of one divine essence in three persons.\n   - Orthodox Christianity insists on God’s unity and simplicity and on the Trinity as an eternal communion of persons within the one divine essence.\n\n4. What “becoming god” means\n   - LDS: often taught as an ontological ascent to godhood (creating worlds, fathering spirit children), implying parity in kind with Heavenly Father.\n   - Orthodox/Western classical: “Deification” is participation by grace; humans remain creatures, transformed ethically and spiritually, not turned into gods by nature.\n\nScriptural and creedal considerations\n- Scriptures Christians cite for God’s aseity and uniqueness: Exodus 3:14 (“I AM”), Isaiah 43:10–11, Acts 17:24–25; for theosis: 2 Peter 1:4 and the patristic tradition (Athanasius) about participation in divine life. The Nicene and Chalcedonian formulations protect both the uniqueness of God and the true divinity and humanity of Christ — and thereby shape how Christians understand any claim that God “was once” a man.\n\nA charitable note about overlap and misunderstandings\n- The patristic phrase “become god” is sometimes quoted to suggest similarity, but patristic theosis always preserves Creator/creature distinction: humans become “partakers of the divine nature,” not gods by essence.\n- Some Latter‑day Saints emphasize relational and transformational aspects of their teaching and would deny crude readings that reduce everything to literal ontological equivalence; still, the mainstream LDS theological framework holds claims that are at odds with classical theism.\n\nConclusion\nThe LDS couplet expresses a doctrine — that God was once as we are and that we may become as God is — that departs significantly from historic Christian orthodoxy. While both traditions value transformation into Godlikeness and use language of “becoming like God,” orthodox Christianity rejects the notion that God was once a created mortal or that creatures can become gods in God’s own essence. The differences are not merely semantic but concern the nature of God, the Creator/creature distinction, and the meaning of salvation and deification. A respectful dialogue can focus on shared commitments (God’s love, Christ’s transforming work, human destiny in communion with God) while recognizing these fundamental theological divergences.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer accurately distinguishes LDS teachings from historic Christian orthodoxy. It correctly notes the Creator/creature distinction, God’s aseity, and the orthodox understanding of the Trinity. It affirms that while both traditions speak of becoming ‘like God’ or sharing in God’s life, orthodox Christianity rejects the idea that God was once a mortal being or that creatures can become gods by nature. It also correctly describes theosis as participation by grace rather than ontological identity with God, preserving the uncreated Creator while allowing transformative union with the divine life. The response cites relevant biblical/creedal anchors (e.g., Exodus 3:14, Isaiah 43:10–11, 2 Pet 1:4, Nicene Creed) and articulates the key doctrinal differences with clear nuance. The evaluation would be strengthened by explicitly noting that some patristic language about deification is contextually cautious about the creature/Creator distinction, but the summary given is accurate and aligned with orthodox teaching."
