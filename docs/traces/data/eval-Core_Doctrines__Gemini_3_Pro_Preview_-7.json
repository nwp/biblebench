    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "**The Doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body**\n\nAs a systematic theologian, I define the doctrine of the **Resurrection of the Body** as the future, eschatological act of God wherein the dead—both the righteous and the unrighteous—are raised to life in bodily form. This event is inextricably linked to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ (the Parousia).\n\nThis doctrine stands in stark contrast to the Greek philosophical concept of the \"immortality of the soul,\" which views the body as a prison to be escaped. Instead, Christian theology affirms that the human person is a unified psychosomatic whole (body and soul) and that redemption is not complete until the body is restored, glorified, and reunited with the soul/spirit.\n\nHere is a systematic breakdown of the doctrine.\n\n---\n\n### I. The Biblical Foundation\nThe doctrine is not merely a comforting sentiment but is structurally necessary to the biblical narrative.\n\n**1. Old Testament Anticipation**\nWhile the concept develops slowly in the Old Testament, clear affirmations appear in the prophets.\n*   **Job 19:26:** \"And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God.\"\n*   **Daniel 12:2:** \"And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.\"\n\n**2. The Resurrection of Jesus (The Prototype)**\nThe linchpin of this doctrine is the bodily resurrection of Jesus. He is described by the Apostle Paul as the \"firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep\" (1 Corinthians 15:20).\n*   **Physicality:** In Luke 24:39, the risen Jesus asserts, \"See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.\" He eats broiled fish to prove He is not a ghost.\n*   **Transformation:** While His body was physical, it was also transfigured—able to appear inside locked rooms and free from the constraints of mortal decay.\n\n**3. Pauline Theology**\nThe most extensive treatment is found in **1 Corinthians 15**. Paul argues that if there is no resurrection of the dead, Christ is not raised, and faith is futile. He teaches that redemption applies to the physical creation, stating in Romans 8:23 that we wait eagerly for \"the redemption of our bodies.\"\n\n---\n\n### II. The Nature of the Resurrected Body\nWhat will the resurrected body look like? Christian theology holds two distinctive tensions: **Continuity** and **Discontinuity**.\n\n**1. Continuity (It is *your* body)**\nThere is a connection between the body that dies and the body that is raised. The tomb of Jesus was empty; God did not create a new Jesus ex nihilo (from nothing), but raised the body that was crucified. Therefore, the resurrection preserves personal identity.\n\n**2. Discontinuity (It is a *transforming* body)**\nPaul uses the agricultural metaphor of a seed (1 Cor. 15:35-44). The seed (the mortal body) is buried, but what comes out of the ground is different in glory and power, though related to the seed.\nPaul lists four changes in the believer's body:\n*   **Sown imperishable:** It will no longer be subject to sickness, aging, or death.\n*   **Sown in glory:** It will be radiant, free from the shame of sin.\n*   **Sown in power:** It will be robust and capable, no longer weak.\n*   **Sown a spiritual body (*soma pneumatikon*):** This is often misunderstood. It does not mean a body made of \"spirit\" (mist) or gas. It means a body *animated and empowered* by the Holy Spirit, suitable for the new creation, rather than a \"natural body\" driven by ordinary biological life (*psyche*).\n\n---\n\n### III. The Scope and Timing\nThe resurrection is a universal event, though the outcome differs based on one's relationship to Christ.\n\n*   **Universal Scope:** Jesus taught, \"Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment\" (John 5:28-29).\n*   **Timing:** While theologians debate the specifics of the millennium and the tribulation, the classic orthodox position is that the general resurrection occurs at the end of the age, coinciding with the Return of Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:16).\n\n---\n\n### IV. Theological Significance\nWhy does this doctrine matter? It carries profound implications for how we view God and the world.\n\n**1. The Goodness of Material Creation**\nThis doctrine refutes Gnosticism (which claims matter is evil). By resurrecting the body, God reaffirms his verdict in Genesis 1: \"It is very good.\" God intends to redeem the physical world, not scrap it.\n\n**2. The Defeat of Death**\nDeath is the separation of soul and body. If the soul lives on forever but the body remains dust, death has won a partial victory by unmaking the human nature. The resurrection is the reversal of the curse of Eden, the final conquering of death (1 Corinthians 15:54-55).\n\n**3. The Totality of Salvation**\nSanctification is not merely the purification of the mind or emotions. God saves *humans*, and humans are embodied creatures. Therefore, salvation must encompass our biology as well as our psychology and pneumatology (spirit).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe doctrine of the resurrection of the body teaches that the ultimate Christian hope is not an eternity as a disembodied spirit floating in an ethereal heaven. Rather, the hope is for the restoration of the whole person, to live in a glorified, physical body, on a renewed Earth, in the direct presence of God. It is the affirmation that **matter matters to God**, and that in Christ, the physical order is destined for glory.",

            "In the breakdown of the resurrected body, the LLM maps the contrasts as “sown imperishable; sown in glory; sown in power; sown a spiritual body.” This does not align with Paul’s explicit sequence in 1 Corinthians 15 (perishable ⇒ imperishable; dishonor ⇒ glory; weakness ⇒ power; natural body ⇒ spiritual body). The second item should be “sown in dishonor” (not “sown in glory”). This is a minor textual cue but affects precision.",
            "The conclusion’s emphasis on a renewed Earth reflects a particular eschatological reading. While compatible with many orthodox trajectories (including a future new heavens and new earth), it is a specific interpretive angle and not absolutely required by all traditional creedal formulations of the resurrection.",
            "The claim that the resurrection definitively unites soul/spirit with a glorified body as a single psychosomatic whole is broadly correct, but the LLM could have acknowledged tensions in historic debates about the exact nature of the intermediate state (death, heaven, and the immediate disembodied existence before the general resurrection). Acknowledging this nuance would enhance precision."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is largely accurate and well-grounded in Scripture (Key texts: John 5:28–29; 1 Cor 15; Rom 8:23; Luke 24:39; Job 19:26; Dan 12:2). It correctly emphasizes bodily resurrection, continuity with the person, and the transformation into a glorified body, while resisting Gnostic tendencies. It also correctly situates the resurrection in the Second Coming framework and highlights the salvific scope for the whole person. The main points of refinement are (1) a need for precise mapping of 1 Corinthians 15’s contrasts (the sequence of ‘perishable/imperishable’ etc.), (2) avoiding any premature sweeping statement about universal life for all in the opening line, and (3) noting that eschatological details (renewed earth vs. new creation) reflect a particular but not universally binding interpretive stance. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically anchored, and nuanced, with only a few minor clarifications needed."
