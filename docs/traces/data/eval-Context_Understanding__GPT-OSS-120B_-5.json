          "rationale": "The LLM's answer accurately identifies Revelation's purpose as encouraging persecuted believers with the assurance of God's ultimate victory, Christ's return, and the final judgment, and it adds the exhortation to persevere in faith. This aligns with core biblical themes in Revelation (e.g., victorious Christ, Second Coming, final judgment) and with historic Christian orthodoxy. It briefly touches on key aspects (perseverance, hope) but misses some nuanced dimensions of Revelation’s genre (apocalyptic symbolism, worship/liturgy emphasis, and the range of interpretive frameworks such as millennial viewpoints). Overall, a solid, biblically grounded, and doctrinally sound summary with room for deeper nuance."
