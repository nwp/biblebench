It cites multiple biblical texts to show variety (Psalms of both structure and exuberance; Colossians 3:16; 1 Corinthians 14:26) and explicitly values both traditional liturgy and contemporary adaptation. By framing the question around worship’s purpose (encountering God, formation of disciples) and warning against both “shallow traditionalism” and “shallow contemporaneity,” it avoids privileging either side and instead advocates a balanced synthesis. It invites nuance, acknowledges legitimate diversity, and does not push a conservative or progressive doctrinal program. This overall stance aligns with a moderate position that acknowledges multiple valid approaches without committing to a specific traditionalist or reformist agenda.",
