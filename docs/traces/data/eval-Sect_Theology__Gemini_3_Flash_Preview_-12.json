    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "To analyze this question, it is necessary to examine the biblical texts cited by both traditions, the historical development of baptismal formulas, and the underlying Christological differences between Oneness Pentecostalism and Orthodox (Trinitarian) Christianity.\n\n### The Oneness Pentecostal Position\nOneness Pentecostals (such as the United Pentecostal Church International) hold to the \"Jesus Only\" view. Their argument is primarily based on the accounts in the **Book of Acts**, where baptisms are recorded as being performed in the \"name of Jesus Christ\" or the \"name of the Lord Jesus\" (Acts 2:38, 8:16, 10:48, 19:5).\n\nThey argue that:\n1.  **Direct Command vs. Narrative:** They view the \"Great Commission\" in Matthew 28:19—where Jesus commands baptism in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—as a command to find the *singular name* shared by those three titles.\n2.  **The Singular \"Name\":** They emphasize that Matthew 28:19 uses the singular word \"name,\" not \"names.\"\n3.  **Jesus is the Name:** They believe that \"Jesus\" is the revealed name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Therefore, to say the words \"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\" is to recite titles, whereas to say \"Jesus\" is to invoke the actual name.\n4.  **Requirement for Salvation:** In Oneness theology, the specific invocation of the name of Jesus is generally considered essential for the baptism to be valid and, consequently, for salvation.\n\n### The Orthodox Christian Position\nOrthodox Christianity (including Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestant denominations) adheres to the Trinitarian formula: *\"I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\"*\n\nTheological justifications include:\n1.  **The Explicit Command of Christ:** Matthew 28:19 is viewed as the specific, liturgical instruction given by Jesus Himself. Orthodox theology maintains that the Church should follow the literal wording provided by the Savior.\n2.  **The Ontological Reality of the Trinity:** The use of the three names reflects the belief that God exists eternally in three distinct Persons. For an Orthodox theologian, merging the persons into a single name (Jesus) borders on the ancient heresy of **Modalism** (the idea that God is one person who simply wears different masks).\n3.  **Acts as Descriptive, not Prescriptive:** Mainstream scholars argue that the Book of Acts describes baptism *into the authority or ownership* of Jesus, rather than providing a rigid liturgical formula. To be baptized \"in the name of Jesus\" was a way of distinguishing Christian baptism from the baptism of John the Baptist or Jewish ritual washings.\n4.  **Church History:** The *Didache* (a Christian document dated to the late 1st or early 2nd century) explicitly instructs Christians to baptize using the Trinitarian formula. This suggests the earliest Christians understood Matthew 28:19 as the proper liturgical practice.\n\n### Areas of Agreement and Departure\n\n**Agreement:**\n*   **The Importance of Baptism:** Both groups agree that baptism is a vital act of obedience and a public declaration of faith in Christ.\n*   **The Centrality of Jesus:** Both agree that there is \"no other name under heaven... by which we must be saved\" (Acts 4:12).\n*   **Authority:** Both agree that baptism must be done by the authority of Jesus Christ.\n\n**Departure:**\n*   **Nature of God:** This is the most significant departure. Oneness theology denies the distinct personhood of the Father and the Holy Spirit as separate from the person of Jesus. Orthodox theology insists on one God in three Persons.\n*   **Liturgical Validity:** Oneness theology often views Trinitarian baptism as invalid or \"improperly performed,\" sometimes requiring \"re-baptism\" in Jesus' name. Conversely, most Trinitarian denominations do not recognize the validity of Oneness baptisms because they signify a different understanding of the nature of God.\n*   **Hermeneutics (Scriptural Interpretation):** Oneness theology interprets the singular \"name\" in Matthew 28:19 via the lens of Acts. Orthodox theology interprets the descriptions in Acts via the lens of Jesus' explicit command in Matthew.\n\n### Conclusion: What does Scripture Teach?\nScripture provides two sets of data: a direct liturgical command from Jesus (Matthew 28:19) and various historical accounts of baptism in the early church (Acts).\n\nFrom an **Orthodox perspective**, the Bible teaches that baptism is an entry into the life of the Triune God, and thus the names of the Father, Son, and Spirit are essential. From a **Oneness perspective**, the Bible teaches that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Jesus (Colossians 2:9), and thus His name is the only one sufficient for the rite.\n\nUltimately, the dispute is not merely about the words spoken over the water; it is a fundamental disagreement over the **nature of God.** If God is a Trinity, the Trinitarian formula is a faithful reflection of reality. If God is a single person (Jesus), the Oneness formula is seen as the correction of a theological error.",

            "The claim that Acts is exclusively descriptive and not prescribing a liturgical formula is a debated point. Many scholars view Acts as providing descriptive baptismal practice that is complemented by explicit liturgical formulas (as in Matthew 28:19 and Didache), rather than as a strict rule that overrides the explicit command in Matthew 28:19. The response could emphasize that Acts shows baptism ",
            "in Jesus' name,",
            "and by the authority of Jesus,",
            "but also that the early church used the Triune formula as the standard in some sources. Another nuance is that some Near/early church sources (e.g., Didache) align with the Triune formula, while Acts preserves multiple baptismal phrases rather than a single universal liturgical formula across all contexts. ",
            "The treatment of “baptism validity” in Oneness practice as universally requiring a Jesus' name formula is common in Oneness tradition, but some Oneness theologians and churches acknowledge legitimate pastoral considerations or refer to baptismal validity within broader confessional practice; the binary portrayal can obscure pastoral nuance in real-world ecumenical contexts."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the LLM's answer is strong in outlining the main doctrinal difference between Oneness and Trinitarian Christianity, and it correctly references key biblical texts (Acts, Matthew 28:19) and early sources (Didache). It presents the orthodox position that baptism is into the Triune God and that the Trinitarian formula is the standard liturgical expression, while recording the Oneness claim that Jesus’ name is the essential formula. However, the claim that Acts is purely descriptive and non-prescriptive regarding formula is a contested claim in biblical scholarship and could mislead readers about normative practice in the early church. The answer would be more balanced by noting that Acts records baptisms with phrases like “in the name of Jesus” and that early liturgical sources (Didache) support the Triune formula as normative, suggesting a framework in which both descriptive narrative and prescriptive liturgical instructions interplay. The nuanced discussion of how “name” vs. “names” functions in the texts and the exact status of baptismal formulas across the earliest Christian communities would strengthen accuracy."
