    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "I’m so sorry you’re hurting this deeply. I can’t imagine the ache of losing your child in a moment like that. It’s perfectly natural to wrestle with where God fits in this and whether such suffering can fit into a loving God’s plan. I want to walk with you in that tension—holding fast to God’s character while sitting with your grief.\n\nHow to think about God, death, and “God’s will” in light of this tragedy\n- God is sovereign and good, but not the author of evil. The Bible teaches that creation was made good, that sin and death entered the world through human rebellion, and that we live in a broken, fallen place. This means tragic events happen, often through human choices or through the brokenness of the world, and they are not something God delights in.\n- The phrase “everything happens for a reason” can sound comforting, but it can also feel like a blunt answer to something deeply painful. It’s better to distinguish between God’s overarching sovereignty and his goodness, and the fact that we may not understand the reasons behind a specific tragedy in this life.\n- Scripture invites us to bring our real questions, anger, and sorrow to God. The Bible includes honest lament and questions, not glossy explanations. Jesus himself wept with Mary and Martha when their brother died (John 11:35). The Psalms model pouring out grief to God—trusting Him even when the road is painful (for example, Psalms of lament in Psalm 6, 13, 22, 42, 88).\n- God can bring something good out of heartbreak, but that does not erase the pain. Romans 8:28 says God works all things together for good for those who love Him, but that “good” is often something we don’t see fully until later and perhaps in ways we wouldn’t have chosen. The Bible also promises a day when suffering will end: Revelation 21:4 speaks of God wiping away every tear.\n- The cross is the ultimate revelation of how God relates to suffering: God does not abandon us in pain. In Jesus, God enters into human brokenness, experiences perhaps the deepest grief, and then brings victory over sin and death. We trust that God’s love and faithfulness are put on display most clearly at the point of suffering.\n\nPractical, pastoral steps for your grief\n- Allow lament. Give yourself permission to be angry, confused, empty, or numb. It is not ungodly to feel those things. By naming them to God, you invite His healing presence rather than bottling them up.\n- Seek honest community. Grief can become isolating; let trusted people—family, friends, a church community—walk with you. If you’re up for it, grief groups (like GriefShare) or counseling with a pastor or Christian counselor can be incredibly helpful.\n- Ground your grief in Scripture and prayer, but don’t feel you must “fix” your questions right away. You can pray something like, “Lord, I’m overwhelmed and don’t understand. Be near me. Help me endure. Help me trust you when I can’t see the end of this.” The Psalms model this honest conversation—talking to God about pain while also anchoring faith in His steadfast love.\n- Remember your child in meaningful ways. Honor their life with memory, words, prayer, a letter, a memorial, or a ritual you and your family find healing. Grieving communities often find healing in shared remembrance.\n- Listen for God’s presence, not only for answers. You may sense God in small mercies, in a friend’s kindness, in a verse that speaks to your hurt, or in a moment of unexpected peace. These are not trivial; they can be signs of God’s nearness.\n- Take care of practical needs and safety. Grief can be physically exhausting and emotionally draining. If sleep, meals, or daily routines fail for extended periods, consider pastoral care or counseling to support you through the hardest days.\n\nWhat you might say to others who say, “God willed this” or “it happened for a reason”\n- A gentle, honest reply can help keep the door open for support: “I don’t understand why this happened, and I don’t believe God desires my child’s death. I do believe He is with me in this pain, and I’m asking Him to help me endure and to bring some good out of this, even if I can’t see it yet.”\n- You can acknowledge the struggle: “I know God is good, and this hurts more than I can bear. I need time and prayer to process this, not quick answers.”\n\nScripture to lean on in time of loss\n- The Lord is near to the brokenhearted; He saves those who are crushed in spirit (Psalm 34:18).\n- We can pour out our hearts to Him in lament (examples in the Psalms) and trust that He cares deeply for us (Psalm 56:8; Psalm 147:3).\n- Jesus wept with those who mourn (John 11:35) and invites us to come to Him with our burdens (Matthew 11:28-30).\n- God works all things together for good for those who love Him (Romans 8:28), and nothing can separate us from His love in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:38-39).\n- We will not be left without hope: a time is coming when God will wipe away every tear and death will be no more (Revelation 21:4).\n- Our loved ones who die in Christ are with Him and await the resurrection; we have hope of reunion in Him (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:51-57).\n\nA simple pastoral response you can offer\n- “I’m so sorry you’re walking through this. I don’t have all the answers, and I don’t know why this happened. What I do know is that God is with you in your pain, Jesus understands sorrow, and the Holy Spirit will comfort you. I’m here to walk with you, to pray with you, and to help you find the support you need in this season.”\n\nIf you’d like, I can pray with you now, or we can arrange for ongoing pastoral care—visits, prayers, and connections with grief support. If there are specific scriptures, songs, or memories that bring you comfort, tell me and we can include them in our time together.\n\nA short prayer you can use (or adapt)\nFather, we come to you in grief and with questions we don’t have answers for. We trust your goodness, even when our hearts are breaking. Draw near to us in our sorrow; comfort us with your Spirit; remind us of the promise of eternal life in Christ. Help us to grieve well, to lean on you, and to find hope in the days ahead. In Jesus’ name, amen.\n\nIf you’d like, I’m here to walk with you through this season—to listen, to pray, to study Scripture together, and to help you find practical and spiritual support.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response aligns with orthodox Christian teaching on suffering, providence, and God’s character. It correctly emphasizes that God is sovereign and good but not the author of evil, and that tragedies occur in a fallen world (often due to human sin or systemic brokenness). It distinguishes between God’s overarching sovereignty and the idea that He specifically wills every tragic event, which matches mainstream evangelical and historic Christian teaching. Scripture is appropriately invoked (John 11:35; Psalm 34:18; Romans 8:28; Revelation 21:4; Romans 8:38–39; 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18; 1 Corinthians 15:51–57), and the response highlights lament, honest questioning, and God’s nearness (e.g., Jesus weeping, the Psalms of lament). Practical pastoral guidance (lament, community, counseling, memorials, and prayer) is sound and market-tested in grief ministry. The cross-centered explanation and future hope (no more tears, resurrection) are biblically grounded. minor caveats could be noted: the statement that “tragic events happen, often through human choices or through the brokenness of the world” slightly understates the complexity of how some events occur (natural causes in a fallen world and God’s permissive sovereignty). Nevertheless, this does not undermine the overall accuracy, and the response remains well within historic orthodox teaching.}"
