    "expected": "Calvinism and Arminianism differ primarily on sovereignty and free will. Calvinists emphasize God's unconditional election, where God chooses who will be saved based solely on His will (TULIP: Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance of saints). Arminians emphasize that God's election is based on foreknowledge of who will freely choose faith, that Christ's atonement is unlimited, that grace can be resisted, and that believers can potentially lose salvation. Both affirm salvation by grace through faith and God's sovereignty, but differ on how divine sovereignty relates to human choice. Both views have been held by orthodox Christians throughout church history.",
    "output": "### Overview of Calvinist and Arminian Theology\nCalvinism and Arminianism are two major soteriological (salvation-related) frameworks within Protestant Christianity, both rooted in the Reformation emphasis on *sola scriptura* (Scripture alone), *sola fide* (faith alone), and *sola gratia* (grace alone). They share core orthodox beliefs, including the Trinity, the full deity and humanity of Christ, His atoning death and bodily resurrection, justification by faith, and the authority of Scripture. The primary differences center on the interplay between God's sovereignty and human responsibility in salvation, sparked by the teachings of Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560–1609), whose followers issued the *Remonstrance* of 1610. This led to the Calvinist response at the Synod of Dort (1618–1619), which articulated the \"five points of Calvinism\" (often acronymized as TULIP). John Calvin (1509–1564) himself predates these specifics, but his emphasis on divine sovereignty heavily influences Reformed theology.\n\nThese views are held by faithful Christians across denominations:\n- **Calvinist/Reformed perspectives**: Common in Presbyterian (e.g., PCA, OPC), Reformed (e.g., CRCNA, URCNA), some Baptist (e.g., Reformed Baptists), and certain Lutheran traditions.\n- **Arminian/Wesleyan perspectives**: Prominent in Methodist/Wesleyan (e.g., UMC, Nazarene), Free Will Baptist, Pentecostal/Charismatic, and some Anabaptist groups.\n\nThe debate enriches the church by highlighting complementary biblical truths—God's absolute sovereignty (e.g., Rom. 9; Eph. 1) and human accountability (e.g., John 3:16; 2 Pet. 3:9). Below, I outline the key differences using the TULIP framework for clarity, presenting each side's scriptural reasoning and theological emphasis without endorsement.\n\n### The Five Points: Calvinism (TULIP) vs. Arminianism\n\n| **Point**              | **Calvinist View (Reformed)** | **Arminian View (Remonstrant/Wesleyan)** | **Key Scriptures Cited by Each** |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **1. Depravity (Human Nature)** | **Total Depravity**: Sin has corrupted every part of human nature (mind, will, emotions), rendering people spiritually dead and unable to choose God or respond to the gospel without prior regeneration by the Holy Spirit. Humans are not as bad as they *could* be but are totally unable to save themselves. | **Partial Depravity with Prevenient Grace**: Sin affects the whole person, but God's \"prevenient grace\" (a universal enabling grace given to all through Christ's atonement) restores enough free will for everyone to respond to the gospel. No one is forced, but all are enabled. | - Calvinist: Eph. 2:1–5; Rom. 3:10–18; John 6:44.<br>- Arminian: Titus 2:11; John 1:9; Rom. 5:18. |\n| **2. Election (God's Choice)** | **Unconditional Election**: God sovereignly chooses (elects) individuals for salvation from eternity past, based solely on His mercy and purpose, not on any foreseen faith, merit, or action. The non-elect are passed over (not double-predestined to damnation in most views). | **Conditional Election**: God elects those whom He foresees will freely respond in faith to His grace. Election is corporate (based on faith) and gracious but conditioned on human response. | - Calvinist: Rom. 9:11–16; Eph. 1:4–5; Acts 13:48.<br>- Arminian: Rom. 8:29; 1 Pet. 1:1–2; John 3:16. |\n| **3. Atonement (Christ's Death)** | **Limited (or Particular/Definite) Atonement**: Christ's death provides full atonement *only* for the elect, actually securing their salvation (intentional efficacy). It is unlimited in *value* but limited in *extent*. | **Unlimited (or Universal) Atonement**: Christ died for *all* humanity, providing sufficient atonement for everyone, but it is efficient only for those who believe. God's desire is for all to be saved. | - Calvinist: John 10:11, 15; Eph. 5:25; Matt. 1:21.<br>- Arminian: 1 John 2:2; 2 Pet. 2:1; 1 Tim. 2:4–6. |\n| **4. Grace (God's Call)** | **Irresistible (or Effectual) Grace**: The Holy Spirit's regenerating grace to the elect cannot be ultimately resisted; it effectually draws them to faith, overcoming their resistance. | **Resistible Grace**: God's grace woos and enables all people, but it can be freely resisted or rejected through human will. | - Calvinist: John 6:37, 44; Ezek. 36:26–27; Acts 16:14.<br>- Arminian: Acts 7:51; Matt. 23:37; Heb. 3:7–8. |\n| **5. Perseverance (Security of Salvation)** | **Perseverance of the Saints**: All true believers, being kept by God's power, will persevere in faith to the end and cannot lose salvation. Apparent apostasy reveals they were never truly elect. | **Conditional Security (or Assurance through Perseverance)**: True believers are secure as long as they remain in faith, but genuine believers can apostatize (fall away) through unfaithfulness, forfeiting salvation. Many Arminians emphasize warnings against falling away. | - Calvinist: John 10:28–29; Phil. 1:6; Rom. 8:38–39.<br>- Arminian: Heb. 6:4–6; 2 Pet. 2:20–22; Ezek. 18:24. |\n\n### Additional Nuances and Historical Context\n- **Predestination**: Calvinists emphasize *double predestination* (God actively elects some to salvation and passes over others), though many soften it to single predestination. Arminians reject double predestination, affirming God's universal salvific will while upholding human freedom.\n- **Free Will**: Calvinists affirm a compatibilist view (free will is compatible with divine determinism; humans act voluntarily according to their nature). Arminians hold libertarian free will (genuine ability to choose otherwise).\n- **Modern Variations**: Not all adherents strictly follow TULIP. \"Four-Point Calvinists\" (Amyraldians) affirm unlimited atonement. \"Middle Knowledge\" (Molinism) bridges some gaps, held by some Arminians and non-Calvinists. Wesleyans add emphasis on entire sanctification (Christian perfection).\n- **Worship and Practice**: Calvinists often prioritize God's glory in predestination (e.g., Westminster Confession). Arminians stress holy living and missions, motivated by universal grace (e.g., Methodist quadrilateral).\n\nBoth traditions affirm that salvation is ultimately by God's grace alone through faith in Christ, not human works (Eph. 2:8–9). The Synod of Dort condemned extreme Arminianism but allowed for diversity. Today, many evangelicals (e.g., via \"non-TULIP\" views like those in the SBC) blend elements or remain agnostic. Theological diversity here fosters humility, as all sides appeal to Scripture, reminding us that \"we see in a mirror dimly\" (1 Cor. 13:12). For deeper study, consult primary sources like Calvin's *Institutes*, Arminius's *Works*, Wesley's sermons, or the Canons of Dort.",

These issues affect precision but not the overall helpful, biblically grounded survey."
