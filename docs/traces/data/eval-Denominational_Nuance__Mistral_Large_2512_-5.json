    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",
    "output": "The question of **spiritual gifts**—particularly the so-called *\"sign gifts\"* like prophecy, tongues, and healing—has been a significant point of theological divergence between **charismatic/Pentecostal Christians** and **cessationist Christians**. Both groups affirm the **core orthodox beliefs** of the Christian faith (e.g., the Trinity, the deity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith), but they differ in their understanding of how the Holy Spirit operates in the church today. Below is a fair and respectful exploration of their perspectives, acknowledging legitimate theological diversity while maintaining fidelity to historic Christian doctrine.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Charismatic/Pentecostal Perspective: Continuationism**\n**Core Belief:** *The supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit (e.g., prophecy, tongues, healing, miracles) continue to operate in the church today as they did in the New Testament.*\n\n#### **Key Theological Foundations:**\n- **Biblical Basis:**\n  - **1 Corinthians 12-14** – Paul describes spiritual gifts as active and necessary for the edification of the church.\n  - **Acts 2:17-18** – Peter quotes Joel 2:28-32, declaring that the outpouring of the Spirit (including prophecy and visions) is for \"all flesh\" in the \"last days.\"\n  - **Mark 16:17-18** – Jesus promises that believers will perform signs (e.g., casting out demons, speaking in tongues, healing the sick).\n  - **1 Corinthians 1:7** – Paul says the Corinthians \"do not lack any spiritual gift\" as they await Christ’s return.\n\n- **Theological Rationale:**\n  - **The Holy Spirit’s Ministry is Unchanged** – Since the Holy Spirit is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8), His gifts should not be limited to the apostolic age.\n  - **The Church Still Needs Power** – Spiritual gifts are given for **edification, evangelism, and mission** (1 Cor. 14:3-5, 26). If the church lacks these gifts, it is weakened in its witness.\n  - **Experience Confirms Scripture** – Many charismatics point to **personal and corporate experiences** of healing, prophecy, and tongues as evidence of the Spirit’s ongoing work.\n\n- **Distinctives:**\n  - **Baptism in the Holy Spirit** – Often seen as a **second work of grace** (distinct from conversion) that empowers believers for ministry (Acts 2:4, 8:14-17, 19:1-6).\n  - **Tongues as Initial Evidence** – Some Pentecostals (e.g., Assemblies of God) teach that speaking in tongues is the **initial physical evidence** of Spirit baptism.\n  - **Prophecy Today** – Modern prophecy is seen as **fallible but useful** for encouragement and guidance (1 Cor. 14:29-31), not on par with Scripture.\n  - **Healing in the Atonement** – Some believe physical healing is included in Christ’s atonement (Isaiah 53:5, 1 Peter 2:24) and should be expected today.\n\n#### **Denominational Examples:**\n- **Pentecostal:** Assemblies of God, Church of God in Christ (COGIC), Foursquare Church.\n- **Charismatic (within mainline denominations):** Catholic Charismatic Renewal, Anglican Renewal Ministries, some Baptist and Methodist charismatic fellowships.\n- **Third Wave (Neo-Charismatic):** Vineyard Movement, some independent megachurches (e.g., Bethel Church, Hillsong).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Cessationist Perspective: The Gifts Have Ceased**\n**Core Belief:** *The supernatural \"sign gifts\" (prophecy, tongues, apostolic miracles) were temporary and ceased after the apostolic age, though the Holy Spirit still works in other ways.*\n\n#### **Key Theological Foundations:**\n- **Biblical Basis:**\n  - **1 Corinthians 13:8-10** – Paul says prophecies and tongues \"will cease\" when \"the perfect comes\" (often interpreted as the **completion of the New Testament canon**).\n  - **Ephesians 2:20** – The church is \"built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,\" suggesting their unique role was foundational and temporary.\n  - **Hebrews 2:3-4** – God bore witness to the apostles’ message with \"signs and wonders,\" implying these were **confirmatory** for the early church’s unique mission.\n  - **2 Corinthians 12:12** – Paul calls signs and wonders \"the marks of a true apostle,\" suggesting they were tied to apostolic authority.\n\n- **Theological Rationale:**\n  - **The Canon is Complete** – With the closing of the New Testament, the **revelatory gifts** (prophecy, tongues as revelation) are no longer needed because Scripture is sufficient (2 Tim. 3:16-17).\n  - **Apostolic Age was Unique** – The early church needed **miraculous confirmation** of the gospel (Mark 16:20, Heb. 2:3-4), but this is no longer necessary.\n  - **Historical Evidence** – Many cessationists argue that **post-apostolic church history** shows a decline in miraculous gifts after the 1st century (though some exceptions exist, e.g., early church fathers like Irenaeus).\n  - **Abuse and Counterfeits** – Some cessationists warn that modern claims of prophecy and tongues can lead to **false teaching, emotionalism, or manipulation** (e.g., prosperity gospel, unbiblical prophecies).\n\n- **Distinctives:**\n  - **Non-Revelatory Gifts Continue** – Cessationists affirm that **non-miraculous gifts** (teaching, mercy, administration, evangelism) continue today.\n  - **The Holy Spirit Still Works** – The Spirit convicts, regenerates, sanctifies, and empowers believers for ministry, but **not through sign gifts**.\n  - **Healing is Possible but Not Guaranteed** – While God can heal, cessationists reject the idea that healing is **always God’s will** or that it is **automatically included in the atonement**.\n  - **Tongues as Known Languages** – Some cessationists (e.g., John MacArthur) argue that **biblical tongues were always known human languages** (Acts 2:6-11), not ecstatic speech.\n\n#### **Denominational Examples:**\n- **Reformed Cessationists:** Many Presbyterian (PCA), Reformed Baptist, and some Southern Baptist churches.\n- **Dispensational Cessationists:** Some independent Baptist and fundamentalist churches.\n- **Lutheran & Anglican Cessationists:** Many traditional Lutheran and Anglican churches (though some have charismatic movements).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Middle Positions: Open but Cautious Continuationism**\nSome Christians hold **mediating positions** between strict cessationism and charismatic theology:\n- **Open But Cautious Continuationism** (e.g., Wayne Grudem, John Piper, Sam Storms) – Affirms that **all gifts continue** but with **strong safeguards** against abuse (e.g., testing prophecies, avoiding sensationalism).\n- **Functional Cessationism** – Believes the gifts **could** continue but are **rare or not normative** in most churches today.\n- **Third Wave (Vineyard, some Reformed Charismatics)** – Emphasizes **power evangelism** and **kingdom theology** while avoiding some Pentecostal distinctives (e.g., tongues as initial evidence).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Areas of Agreement (Core Orthodox Beliefs)**\nDespite differences, both sides affirm:\n✅ **The Trinity** – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are co-eternal and co-equal.\n✅ **Salvation by Grace Alone** – Justification is through faith in Christ, not works.\n✅ **The Authority of Scripture** – The Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God.\n✅ **The Holy Spirit’s Work** – The Spirit regenerates, indwells, and sanctifies believers.\n✅ **The Church’s Mission** – To make disciples, preach the gospel, and glorify God.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Key Differences Summarized**\n| **Issue**               | **Charismatic/Pentecostal View** | **Cessationist View** |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Prophecy Today**      | Continues (fallible, for edification) | Ceased (replaced by Scripture) |\n| **Tongues**             | Continues (prayer language & sign) | Ceased (or only known languages) |\n| **Healing**             | Expected (included in atonement) | Possible but not guaranteed |\n| **Miracles**            | Still occur (e.g., raising the dead) | Rare or ceased |\n| **Baptism in the Spirit** | Second experience (often with tongues) | Same as conversion |\n| **Purpose of Gifts**    | Edification, evangelism, power | Confirmation of apostolic message (temporary) |\n| **Scripture & Revelation** | Scripture is supreme, but prophecy is useful | Scripture is **sufficient** (sola Scriptura) |\n\n---\n\n### **6. Respectful Engagement: How to Discuss This Topic**\n- **Avoid Straw Men** – Don’t caricature the other side (e.g., \"Cessationists don’t believe in the Holy Spirit\" or \"Charismatics are all emotional fanatics\").\n- **Acknowledge Mystery** – The Holy Spirit’s work is **not fully comprehensible** (John 3:8), so humility is key.\n- **Test All Things** (1 Thess. 5:21) – Both sides should **evaluate experiences by Scripture**, not vice versa.\n- **Unity in Essentials** – While differences exist, **core gospel truths** unite believers across traditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe debate over spiritual gifts is **not about the existence of the Holy Spirit** but about **how He chooses to work in the church today**. Both charismatic and cessationist perspectives have **biblical and historical warrant**, and both seek to honor God in their understanding of His Word. While the discussion can be passionate, it should always be marked by **charity, humility, and a shared commitment to the gospel**.\n\nWould you like recommendations for further reading from both perspectives?",

Charismatic/Pentecostal Perspective: Continuationism**\n**Core Belief:** *The supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit (e.g., prophecy, tongues, healing, miracles) continue to operate in the church today as they did in the New Testament.*\n\n#### **Key Theological Foundations:**\n- **Biblical Basis:**\n  - **1 Corinthians 12-14** – Paul describes spiritual gifts as active and necessary for the edification of the church.\n  - **Acts 2:17-18** – Peter quotes Joel 2:28-32, declaring that the outpouring of the Spirit (including prophecy and visions) is for \"all flesh\" in the \"last days.\"\n  - **Mark 16:17-18** – Jesus promises that believers will perform signs (e.g., casting out demons, speaking in tongues, healing the sick).\n  - **1 Corinthians 1:7** – Paul says the Corinthians \"do not lack any spiritual gift\" as they await Christ’s return.\n\n- **Theological Rationale:**\n  - **The Holy Spirit’s Ministry is Unchanged** – Since the Holy Spirit is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8), His gifts should not be limited to the apostolic age.\n  - **The Church Still Needs Power** – Spiritual gifts are given for **edification, evangelism, and mission** (1 Cor. 14:3-5, 26).
