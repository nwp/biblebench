          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies salvation by grace through faith and presents a standard Protestant/evangelical summary (grace as initiator, faith as the means of reception, good works as fruit). It cites key verses ( Romans 3:28, Ephesians 2:8-9, Galatians 2:16) and correctly labels Pelagianism as heretical. However, it contains notable nuance gaps: (1) It inappropriately frames Orthodox theology with a 'grace alone' initiator, which understates the Orthodox emphasis on synergy with grace. (2) It misuses James 2:26—faith without works is dead is the point, not a claim that works are merely fruit accompanying faith. (3) It glosses Catholic teaching as rejecting 'pure works-salvation' in a way that can mislead; Catholic soteriology emphasizes grace and faith cooperating with merit (works as a response to grace, not earning salvation apart from grace). These issues affect doctrinal precision, though the overall thrust (salvation by grace through faith; works as fruit, not foundation) is sound. The answer is largely biblically grounded and nuanced in places, but the noted inaccuracies prevent it from being fully robust."
