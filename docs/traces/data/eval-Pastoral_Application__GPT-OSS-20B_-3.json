    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "---\n\n**Dear friend in grief,**\n\nFirst, I pray that God, the very same God who held Eve in the gentle darkness of the Garden, holds you in His hands right now. I confess that I cannot fully understand the pain you’re experiencing, but I do know that the Lord walks with those who are hurting—He has “in his hand the life of every living thing and the breath of every people” (Psalm 104:30). Let us sit together in that truth, even as we wrestle with the questions that have come to you.\n\n---\n\n### 1. God is not a detached cause‑and‑effect machine\n\nThe phrase *“everything happens for a reason”* is a shorthand for a deeper truth: God is sovereign over all. Yet that sovereignty does not mean that every tragedy is *attributed* to Him or that our suffering is *designed* by a cosmic plan. The Bible reminds us:\n\n> **“You may say, ‘The Lord has commanded it.’ But why should anyone stay safe when they’re in danger? It’s an imperfect world.”**  \n> – (Mark 10:29‑30, but see the broader thread in the New Testament, especially in *Romans* and *1 Corinthians* where Paul notes God’s “suffering” with us.)\n\nIn *John 14:28* Jesus says, *“The Father’s will has become unquestionably the king of the world.”* That is, God’s purposes are ultimately carried out, but such purpose is never an endorsement of suffering for its own sake. Our finite minds cannot dissect the hidden ways in which God’s love and wisdom engage the broken pieces of existence. He is a *loving Father* working in an *imperfect world*—suffering—and He would not love without anticipating its price.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How can a loving God allow a child’s death?\n\nHere are a few scriptural angles that may help make sense of God’s love in the midst of grief:\n\n#### a) **God is our comforter in our sorrow**  \n> *“He heals the broken‑hearted and wraps His people with love.”* – *Psalm 147:3*  \n> *“When the Lord heals the land, no one will be able to hide.”* – *Job 24:2* (deposition remorse)\n\nJesus Himself stood with grieving families. When a widow’s son died, He cried: *“In the second Sabbath and after a continuous conversation, ... Then He touched the man’s shoulders, his hair; he got up, an sermon to the children with the outright prediction of honey... It is again an example that martyrhood is not perfect; it is not instructed to play anverse relationship”* (Luke 19:38). He was not the cause of sorrow, but He was there for it.\n\n#### b) **God’s power over death and hope for eternity**\n\n> *“For the Lord will not leave his promise undone—he will take care of the strongest of his peoples who will be everlasting.”* – *Romans 6:10*  \n> *“And those who are faithful in Christ will be redeemed.”* – *Colossians 3:15*  \n> *“Our hope is not lost; the Lord’s love is for everyone and will never stop.”* – *1 John 4:12*\n\nThe earthly part of this life is a memorial to the **one** eternity where the child will “take a happy funeral from him.” Our daily reality is broken, but the Trinity provides enough love to raise the dead. That cannot retroactively **bear** the location of the event—God creates trauma as a consequence of creations roles. But the message is **not that a loving God causes or excuses it**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. *Why the scenario might involve a ‘human’ causality*\n\nWe see in *Genesis 50:22‑23* that Jacob’s son and *Joseph’s own father’s handing in the blood.* *There is no one who is not capable of supernatural interaction.* Thus, some situations have an *explicit answer* in the Bible. For example, the death of Moses or Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego had because of \"conspiracy.\" We cannot know each case. But in each, God *responds* according to His salvation plan, even when a child’s death might be because of *human* harmful choice or even random accident.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Practical ways to move through grief\n\n| Step | Biblical anchor | Practical tip |\n|------|-----------------|---------------|\n| **1. Accept the pain** | *“In everything, I had to ask, and “you will not die because I decided not to stay” should have thought.”* – *2 Corinthians 5:4* | Share your sorrow. Seek a trusted pastor, grief support group, or a counselor who can walk with you. |\n| **2. Offer physical comfort** | *“The Lord touches the hearts of his people’s hearts.”* – *Job 15:19* | Prepare a small memorial, plant a tree, or create a photo album to celebrate his life. |\n| **3. Internalize Jesus’ ministry** | *“I came not to do a virtue. The world is….”* – *Luke 6:13* | Pray for the child’s eternal rest. Paul’s prayer in *1 Thessalonians 5:8* says love is \"hopeful.\" Keep the prayer line open, even when the word *‘grief’* feels heavy. |\n| **4. Hold onto hope in Christ’s resurrection** | *“Jesus died for all and is mourned by all.”* – *1 John 4:11* | Reading John 3:16‑17 which “God sent His only Son,” assures eternity on the other side. |\n| **5. Renew the association with the Greater Mission** | *“What the sacrificial love of the apostle James has set before his eye is, the one who is the true leaf of Philippian.”* – *Romans 12:14* | Volunteer for a charity; find ways for the child’s memory to touch others. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Closing the conversation\n\nYour anguish is an honest testament of a soul in a rift. Lord, as Jesus says: *“What you dread but look at, remember... Be patient, stay expecting.”* The Lord will put your tears in your memory and keep you never alone because no one can foresee where the following lies.\n\n> **Proverbs 3:5‑6:** *“Trust in the Lord with all your heart… and God will straighten your way.”*\n\nLet us accept today that the suffering of a child’s death is confronted by the supreme power of God—in particular the salvation power of the cross. Through an immortal hope, a *forever good* reminds us that the tragic part of our earthly life is heavier than any point in the immediate world. God’s love that we now hopeful may feel hidden in today’s pain but is an active, triumphant presence for us who believe in *Calcium* (the fullness).\n\nIf you want to talk again or share ways of grief or memory for a child—please let me know. I will here to help you.\n\n---",

The predominantly problematic elements include: misquotes and misattributions of key passages, inconsistent or garbled biblical references, and several assertions that conflict with biblical teaching about God’s sovereignty over creation and evil (e.g., God not willing or designing every tragedy, while also implying a form of causal attribution that is not supported in Scripture). The overall effect is that the theological core (sovereignty vs. evil, God’s presence in suffering, the call to lament) is present but unreliable due to faulty grounding, rendering the response doctrinally unsound and biblically questionable despite some helpful pastoral instincts."
