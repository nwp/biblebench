        "output": "Yes—many churches have women serving as the senior/lead pastor. But it depends on the church’s denomination, bylaws, and theology.\n\nKey points:\n- Denominational differences: Some traditions ordain women as pastors or elders (e.g., United Methodist, Episcopal/Anglican, Lutheran, Presbyterian/PCUSA, many evangelical non‑denominational churches). Others restrict senior pastoral leadership to men (e.g., some Baptist groups, and in Catholic and Orthodox settings, women cannot be ordained as priests/pastors).\n- Theological positions: \n  - Egalitarian view: men and women can hold the same leadership roles, including senior pastor.\n  - Complementarian view: men lead in church governance and pastoral leadership, with women serving in complementary roles (though exact boundaries vary by church).\n- Practical step: If you’re asking about a specific church, check its constitution and statement of faith, or ask the church leadership about their policy on female pastors.\n\nIf you share your denomination, location, or the church in question, I can give a more tailored answer.",

There is little to no hedging beyond neutral description, and with the expected position being undefined, there is no clear position to match."
