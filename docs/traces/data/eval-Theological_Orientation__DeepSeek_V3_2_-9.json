    "expected": "",
    "output": "Based on a traditional reading of Scripture and historic Christian teaching, the Bible presents sexual intimacy as designed by God for the covenant relationship of marriage. Here is a balanced examination of the biblical texts and various Christian perspectives:\n\n### Key Biblical Teachings\n1. **Marriage as the Proper Context for Sex**:  \n   Genesis 2:24 establishes the pattern: \"Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.\" This \"one flesh\" union is portrayed as exclusive to the marital bond. In the New Testament, Jesus reaffirms this teaching (Matthew 19:4-6), and Paul warns against sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18-20).\n\n2. **Warnings Against \"Porneia\" (Sexual Immorality)**:  \n   The Greek term *porneia* is used broadly in the New Testament to refer to sexual activity outside of marriage. Passages like 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5 instruct believers to \"abstain from sexual immorality\" and to control one's body in holiness. Hebrews 13:4 upholds marriage as honorable and warns that God will judge the sexually immoral.\n\n3. **The Body as a Temple**:  \n   1 Corinthians 6:18-20 teaches that sexual sin is uniquely damaging because it violates the sanctity of one's body, which is indwelt by the Holy Spirit. Paul urges believers to \"flee from sexual immorality\" and to honor God with their bodies.\n\n4. **Call to Purity and Self-Control**:  \n   Passages like Galatians 5:19-21 list sexual immorality among the works of the flesh, contrasting them with the fruit of the Spirit. Believers are repeatedly called to live in purity (1 Peter 1:15-16; 1 Corinthians 7:8-9).\n\n### Traditional Christian Interpretation\nThroughout church history, the vast majority of Christian traditions—Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant—have interpreted these texts as teaching that:\n- Sexual intercourse is reserved for marriage.\n- Cohabitation (living together in a sexual relationship without marriage) falls under the category of *porneia* and is thus sinful.\n- Celibacy outside of marriage is the biblical standard.\n\nThis view holds that marriage is a sacred covenant that reflects Christ’s relationship with the Church (Ephesians 5:31-32), and sexual intimacy is a profound part of that covenantal union.\n\n### Alternative Christian Perspectives\nSome contemporary Christians, particularly in more progressive traditions, argue for nuanced interpretations:\n- They may emphasize the biblical themes of love, commitment, and justice over specific legal formulations.\n- Some suggest that in modern contexts, committed, monogamous cohabitation could be seen as analogous to biblical marriage if it involves lifelong intention and covenant fidelity.\n- Others focus on the spirit of biblical teachings—avoiding exploitation, promiscuity, and harm—while questioning whether all premarital cohabitation is equally problematic.\n\nHowever, these views remain a minority within global Christian orthodoxy and often face criticism for departing from clear biblical parameters.\n\n### Pastoral Considerations\nMany churches recognize that believers may struggle in this area and emphasize:\n- Grace and forgiveness for past mistakes (1 John 1:9).\n- The importance of community, accountability, and wise counsel.\n- Practical support for couples pursuing chastity before marriage.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe consistent witness of Scripture, supported by nearly two millennia of Christian teaching, is that sexual activity is intended exclusively for the marriage covenant. While the Bible does not address modern cohabitation directly, its principles clearly place sexual intimacy within marriage. Christians who seek to follow biblical authority traditionally view both premarital sex and cohabitation as incompatible with God’s design for sexuality, which aims at human flourishing, covenantal faithfulness, and the reflection of divine love.",

          "explanation": "The response clearly adopts a traditional, conservative reading of Scripture on sexuality: sex is reserved for the marriage covenant, with premarital sex and cohabitation labeled as sinful under the category of porneia, and celibacy outside marriage presented as the biblical standard. This is evidenced by its emphasis on Genesis 2:24, Jesus’ reaffirmation in Matthew 19:4-6, and New Testament warnings (e.g., 1 Corinthians 6:18-20; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5; Hebrews 13:4), as well as the claim that the body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. The text also appeals to the long-standing witness of Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions to support its stance. It does, however, acknowledge disagreement by including a section on Alternative Christian Perspectives, describing more progressive views and noting that they constitute a minority within global Christian orthodoxy; it thus shows awareness of diverse opinions while still foregrounding the traditional position. In terms of tone, the piece is largely doctrinal and assertive—describing a normative biblical-ethical standard as the consistent witness of Scripture and church history—though it attempts pastoral balance with language about grace, forgiveness, and communal support. Overall, the analysis takes a clear conservative position, acknowledges dissent, presents alternative views with some fairness, and remains predominantly dogmatic in its conclusions."
