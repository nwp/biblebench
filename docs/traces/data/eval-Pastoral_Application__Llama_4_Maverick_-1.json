    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "My dear brother or sister, I'm so glad you've come to talk with me about this. I want you to know that you're not alone, and I'm here to offer you support and guidance from Scripture.\n\nFirst and foremost, let's establish that being a Christian is not about being free from struggles or temptations, but about being in a relationship with Jesus Christ, who loves us, forgives us, and transforms us. The Bible teaches that we're all sinners, and we all struggle with various temptations and weaknesses (Romans 3:23; 1 Corinthians 10:13). Your struggle with same-sex attraction is not unique, and it's not a reflection of your worth or your standing with God.\n\nRegarding your question, \"Can I be a Christian and experience these feelings?\" The answer is yes. Being a Christian doesn't mean you'll be exempt from feelings or temptations. In fact, the Bible acknowledges that we will face various struggles, including those related to our sinful nature (Galatians 5:16-17). As a Christian, you're not defined by your feelings or attractions, but by your identity in Christ. You're a child of God, loved, forgiven, and adopted into His family (Ephesians 1:5; Romans 8:15-16).\n\nNow, about your concern that \"God hates me.\" Absolutely not! The Bible declares that God loves you (John 3:16; Romans 5:8). His love is not based on your performance or your feelings, but on His character and His commitment to you as His child. While God's Word teaches that He hates sin, including sexual immorality (Hebrews 13:4; Leviticus 18:22), He loves the sinner. In fact, Jesus demonstrated this love by dying on the cross for our sins, including yours (Romans 5:6-8).\n\nIt's essential to understand that your feelings or attractions are not the same as your actions or choices. While you may experience same-sex attraction, you can still choose to follow Christ and live a life that honors Him. The Bible encourages us to \"flee from sexual immorality\" (1 Corinthians 6:18) and to \"put to death the deeds of the body\" (Romans 8:13). This doesn't mean you'll never struggle, but that you'll intentionally pursue a path that aligns with God's design for your life.\n\nHere's the good news: you don't have to navigate this journey alone. Jesus is with you, and He's committed to transforming you into His likeness (Romans 8:29). You can find support and community among other believers who will pray for you, encourage you, and help you grow in your faith.\n\nAs you move forward, I encourage you to:\n\n1. Seek a deeper understanding of God's design for human sexuality, as revealed in Scripture (Genesis 1:27; 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6).\n2. Cultivate a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, embracing His love, forgiveness, and guidance (John 15:1-11; Philippians 3:7-14).\n3. Connect with a community of believers who will support and encourage you in your walk with God (Hebrews 10:24-25; Galatians 6:2).\n4. Pursue strategies for managing your struggles, such as prayer, accountability, and counseling (Proverbs 11:14; James 5:16).\n\nRemember, my friend, you're loved, you're forgiven, and you're on a journey with a God who is for you, not against you. May you find comfort, hope, and guidance in His presence.\n\nLet's continue to walk this path together, and may God's Word be our guide.",

            "The statement 'God hates sin' is a reasonable biblical-theological stance, but the specific wording cites Hebrews 13:4 and Leviticus 18:22 as explicit proofs of 'God hates sin,' which is not directly stated in Hebrews 13:4 and relies on Mosaic Law (Leviticus) for a point that is often discussed through a broader New Testament witness (e.g., Romans 1, 1 Corinthians 6). A more precise approach would cite passages that directly address sexual immorality in the New Testament (e.g., Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10) and consistently distinguish attraction from action.",
            "The response does not explicitly acknowledge the diversity of orthodox Christian positions on same-sex relationships (some affirm certain committed relationships in different ways, while others advocate celibacy or heterosexual marriage only). This nuance could help readers understand the range of historic Christian interpretations without compromising pastoral care."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM presents a compassionate, biblically grounded pastoral approach: it affirms God’s love, the believer’s identity in Christ, and the distinction between attraction and behavior, while encouraging holiness and community. It quotes or alludes to key texts (Romans 5:8; Romans 8:15-16; 1 Corinthians 6:18; Romans 8:13; Genesis 1:27; Matthew 19:4-6) and aligns with a traditional, conservative reading that same-sex sexual activity is contrary to biblical teaching. Minor doctrinal and hermeneutical gaps exist (overgeneralizing 'God hates sin' with Hebrews 13:4 and Leviticus 18:22, and not explicitly outlining the range of orthodox interpretations on same-sex relationships). Overall, it is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced enough for pastoral counsel."

It grounds statements in Scripture and encourages spiritual practices and community support. However, it could improve theological nuance by more explicitly naming the spectrum of orthodox Christian positions on sexuality, clarifying that orientation is not condemned as sin while actions are, and avoiding language that could imply orientation change is guaranteed or easily achievable. It should also explicitly address mental health resources and the avoidance of coercive or harmful “change efforts,” emphasizing listening, humility, and compassionate pastoral care. Overall, it strikes a thoughtful balance of truth and grace, with room for additional nuance and care in real-world pastoral contexts."
