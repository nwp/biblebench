    "expected": "While 'Jesus is Lord' is foundational (Romans 10:9), orthodox Christianity requires additional essential beliefs about WHO Jesus is. The early creeds developed to combat heresies: Jesus must be confessed as fully God and fully human (against Arianism and Docetism), the Trinity must be affirmed (against modalism), salvation by grace through faith (against works-righteousness), and the authority of Scripture. These essential doctrines form the core of historic Christian orthodoxy.",

            "Inaccuracy regarding Chalcedon: The claim that Chalcedon (451) established the reality of the Trinity is historically inaccurate. The Trinity was articulated earlier at Nicene (325) and Constantinople (381); Chalcedon primarily addressed Christ’s two natures (fully God and fully human) rather than redefining Trinitarian doctrine.",
            "Omission of explicit soteriological emphasis: While the response mentions atonement and the foundational confession, it does not explicitly state the classic Protestant-Catholic emphasis on salvation by grace through faith (sola gratia, sola fide) as foundational for orthodoxy; this is a notable gap given the expected answer’s emphasis on grace through faith.",
            "Minor nuance: The line about Arius and Docetists is broadly accurate but somewhat simplified; the main point is the misuse of the simple formula to support divergent Christologies rather than a precise account of each heresy. This could be clarified to avoid implying that those heresies themselves defined generic confessions of “Jesus is Lord.”"
          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly argues that “Jesus is Lord” is foundational but insufficient for orthodox belief and that the historic church produced creeds to guard core doctrines such as the full divinity and humanity of Christ, the Trinity, and the authority of Scripture. It grounds its claims in Scripture (Rom 10:9; 1 Cor 12:3) and treats orthodoxy as a coherent framework built on the confession of Jesus as Lord. The main strengths are alignment with biblical data and with the general trajectory of historic orthodoxy. The main drawbacks are a factual misstatement about Chalcedon’s role in Trinitarian doctrine and a notable omission of explicit emphasis on salvation by grace through faith as a foundational soteriological principle. Adjusting those points would yield a more precise and complete evaluation. "
