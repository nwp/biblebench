This aligns with biblical data: Revelation 1:1 presents the revelation of Jesus Christ; messages to the churches emphasize perseverance (e.g., Rev 2–3; 14:12); the depiction of Christ’s return and final victory is central (e.g., Rev 19–22). The response is doctrinally orthodox and biblically grounded. It captures the main eschatological hope of Revelation, though a fuller treatment could additionally note themes like worship, cosmic conflict, and the establishment of the new creation; those elements are encompassed within the stated purpose.
