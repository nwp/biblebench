    "input": "Is the statement 'Jesus is Lord' sufficient for orthodox Christian belief, or are there other essential beliefs?",
    "expected": "While 'Jesus is Lord' is foundational (Romans 10:9), orthodox Christianity requires additional essential beliefs about WHO Jesus is. The early creeds developed to combat heresies: Jesus must be confessed as fully God and fully human (against Arianism and Docetism), the Trinity must be affirmed (against modalism), salvation by grace through faith (against works-righteousness), and the authority of Scripture. These essential doctrines form the core of historic Christian orthodoxy.",
    "output": "Short answer: The confession “Jesus is Lord” is orthodox and foundational to Christian faith, but it is not by itself a complete or sufficient summary of all essential Christian belief.\n\nWhy it is orthodox:\n- In the New Testament, “Jesus is Lord” is a decisive confession of Jesus’ divine status and his lordship over creation, history, and salvation (for example, Romans 10:9; 1 Corinthians 12:3; Philippians 2:11). It bears witness to the incarnation and to Jesus’ authority that only God can rightly claim.\n- Historically, Christians have used this confession as a core entry point into the faith, often in baptism and catechesis. It is a true and necessary part of orthodox Christology and soteriology.\n\nWhy it is not sufficient on its own:\n- Orthodoxy, as defined by the historic creeds (Apostles’ Creed, Nicene Creed, Chalcedonian definitions, etc.), includes a fuller set of beliefs about the nature of God, Christ, the Spirit, Scripture, creation, sin, salvation, the church, the sacraments, and eschatology.\n- “Jesus is Lord” must be understood within the Trinitarian framework: the Father is God, the Son is God (consubstantial with the Father), and the Holy Spirit is God; denying any of these would move toward heresy (e.g., Arian or modalist positions).\n- Essential beliefs tied to that confession include:\n  - The Trinity and the full divinity and humanity of Christ (two natures, one person).\n  - The incarnation, atoning death, burial, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus.\n  - The sending of the Holy Spirit and the work of grace in salvation.\n  - The authority and sufficiency of Scripture.\n  - The creedal statement about the church, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the dead, and life everlasting.\n  - The means of grace and the church’s mission (water baptism, Eucharist/Communion, and the ministry of the church) in many traditions.\n\nHow to think about it in practice:\n- Use “Jesus is Lord” as a central, indispensable confession that marks a Christian as one who submits to Jesus’ authority. Yet treat it as the starting point of faith that is completed by assent to the fuller, historical creeds and the gospel message they summarize.\n- If someone adds or subtracts essential doctrines (e.g., denies the Trinity, denies the Incarnation, rejects the resurrection, or denies Scripture’s authority), the confession by itself does not prevent error and would indicate heterodoxy.\n\nPractical takeaway:\n- Yes, “Jesus is Lord” is orthodox and foundational.\n- No, it is not, by itself, a complete statement of all essential Christian belief. For a robust, historically orthodox faith, one also affirms the creedal content that defines the triune God, the person and work of Christ, the Spirit, Scripture, the church, and the hope of glory. Reading the Apostles’ Creed and the Nicene Creed alongside the New Testament would give a fuller, orthodox baseline.",
