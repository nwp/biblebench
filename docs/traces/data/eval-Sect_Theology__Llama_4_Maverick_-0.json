    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "The statement \"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become\" is a well-known teaching within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), also known as Mormonism. This doctrine is often referred to as the concept of \"eternal progression\" or \"exaltation.\" To assess its consistency with orthodox Christian theology, we need to break down the statement and analyze its implications.\n\n1. **\"As man now is, God once was\"**: This part of the statement suggests that God was once a human being who progressed to become what He is now. In LDS theology, it implies that God the Father was once a mortal man on another planet, who through a process of eternal progression, became a god. This idea is not found in orthodox Christian theology, which affirms the eternality and immutability of God (Psalm 90:2; Malachi 3:6; Hebrews 13:8). Orthodox Christianity teaches that God has always been God and has not \"become\" God through any process.\n\n2. **\"As God now is, man may become\"**: This suggests that humans have the potential to become gods through a similar process of eternal progression. In LDS theology, this is tied to the belief in exaltation, where faithful members can become gods and goddesses, ruling over their own planets. Orthodox Christianity teaches that while believers are called to be \"partakers of the divine nature\" (2 Peter 1:4) and are adopted as sons and daughters of God (Romans 8:14-17), they do not become gods. The concept of deification (theosis) in some Eastern Orthodox traditions might seem similar at first glance, but it is understood very differently. Theosis refers to the transformation of believers into the likeness of God through grace, not a literal becoming God or gods. It emphasizes a relational and qualitative transformation rather than an ontological one.\n\n**Comparison with Orthodox Christian Theology**:\n\n- **Nature of God**: The LDS statement contradicts the orthodox Christian understanding of God's nature as eternal, unchanging, and not having a beginning or a process of becoming. Orthodox Christianity affirms the doctrine of the Trinity, understanding God as one essence in three distinct persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), all eternally divine.\n\n- **Potential of Humanity**: While both traditions believe in the potential for human transformation and glorification, they differ significantly in the nature and extent of this transformation. Orthodox Christianity sees salvation as being conformed to the image of Christ (Romans 8:29) and becoming partakers of the divine nature through grace, not by becoming gods.\n\n- **Salvation**: The LDS concept of exaltation is tied to a works-based salvation and a complex cosmology involving multiple heavens and degrees of glory. Orthodox Christianity emphasizes salvation by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9), with good works being a response to God's saving grace.\n\n**Conclusion**: The statement \"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become\" is not consistent with orthodox Christian theology. It diverges from historic Christian doctrine regarding the nature of God and the potential of humanity. While both traditions share a belief in some form of human transformation, the nature, extent, and implications of this transformation are understood differently. The LDS teaching represents a significant departure from the theological framework of orthodox Christianity.",

            "The claim that LDS exaltation is strictly ‘works-based salvation’ is a contested characterization of LDS soteriology and could misrepresent some LDS understandings of grace and faith through temple ordinances and exaltation.",
            "The statement that ‘As man now is, God once was’ is commonly attributed to LDS teaching but is not uniformly formalized in LDS canon or official doctrinal statements; presenting it as a universal, settled doctrine can oversimplify intra-LDS nuance and historical debates.",
            "The assertion that Mormonism is clearly polytheistic can be a polemical shorthand; many LDS theologians and faithful adherents prefer to describe belief in a plurality of exalted beings within a single Godhead framework rather than classic polytheism; this nuance is important for precise dialogue."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately summarizes orthodox Christian concerns: eternal, unchanging God; the Creator-creature distinction; theosis as transformative grace rather than ontological becoming; and it correctly contrasts those with LDS notions of eternal progression and exaltation. It references appropriate scriptures (Malachi 3:6; Hebrews 13:8; 2 Peter 1:4; Romans 8:14-17) and clearly highlights why orthodox theology rejects the specific LDS claims. The main strengths are clarity, biblical framing, and nuanced distinction between theosis and literal deification. The caveats involve a cautious note on how precisely LDS teaching is framed in official doctrine versus popular or informal teaching, and a potential overgeneralization about salvation as ‘works-based’ within Mormon theology; those nuances should be acknowledged to avoid misrepresenting LDS beliefs. Overall, the assessment is solid but would benefit from a more careful treatment of LDS doctrinal diversity on salvation and the nature of the Godhead. "
