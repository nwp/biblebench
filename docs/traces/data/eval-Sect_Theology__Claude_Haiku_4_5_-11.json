    "expected": "No, this is the ancient heresy of modalism (also called Sabellianism), which was condemned by the early church. Orthodox Christianity teaches that God is one being eternally existing as three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Biblical evidence for their simultaneous distinct existence includes Jesus' baptism (Matthew 3:16-17) where the Son is baptized, the Spirit descends, and the Father speaks - all at the same time. Jesus prays to the Father (John 17), showing personal relationship between persons. The apostolic blessing (2 Corinthians 13:14) distinguishes three persons. Modalism was rejected because it cannot account for the relationships within the Godhead and makes Jesus' prayers to the Father nonsensical.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately identifies Oneness Pentecostalism as modalism (modal monarchianism) and correctly states that orthodox Christianity affirms one God in three eternally distinct persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). It correctly notes the historical condemnation of modalism and the traditional Christian teaching on the ontology of the Trinity, including the eternal distinction of the persons and the eternal identity of the Son as the incarnate Word. It also presents common orthodox objections to Oneness theology (incarnation as God temporarily manifesting as Son; difficulties with personal relations within the Godhead). The response includes appropriate caveats about intent and historical context, and it contrasts three-personed orthodoxy with Oneness positions. However, it would be stronger with explicit scriptural citations (e.g., Matthew 3:16-17; John 17; 2 Corinthians 13:14) to ground the claims Biblically, and it could clarify nuances between early councils (Nicaea) and later Christological definitions (Chalcedon) without implying the Trinity was defined equally by both councils. Overall, it is doctrinally sound, nuanced, and aligned with historical orthodoxy.)"
