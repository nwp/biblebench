    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus only seemed to have a physical body. He was actually a purely spiritual being who appeared human but wasn't truly human.' Evaluate this teaching.",
    "expected": "This is the heresy of Docetism. It denies the true humanity of Christ. Orthodox Christianity teaches the hypostatic union - Jesus is fully God AND fully human. He had a real physical body, experienced hunger, thirst, fatigue, and truly died on the cross. 1 John 4:2-3 explicitly condemns denying that Jesus came in the flesh, and Hebrews 2:17 states he had to be made fully human to be our high priest.",
    "output": "This teaching is **heresy**.\n\nSpecifically, this view represents the ancient heresy known as **Docetism** (derived from the Greek word *dokein*, which means \"to seem\" or \"to appear\"). This was one of the earliest threats to the Christian faith, arising in the late first and early second centuries, and it is explicitly refuted in the New Testament and by the early Church Fathers.\n\nHere is a theological and historical analysis of why this teaching is heretical.\n\n### 1. The Definition of the Error\nDocetism is the belief that Jesus Christ was not a true human being in a physical sense, but rather a purely spiritual entity (divine) who only *appeared* or *seemed* to have a physical body. Proponents of this view argued that because matter is inherently evil (a concept rooted in Platonism or Gnosticism), the true God could not contaminate Himself by becoming actual flesh. Therefore, they claimed His humanity was an illusion or a phantom.\n\n### 2. Biblical Refutation\nThe teaching that Jesus \"only seemed\" to have a physical body is directly contradicted by the canonical Scriptures, which affirm the reality of Christ's Incarnation.\n\n*   **The Word Became Flesh:** John 1:14 states, *\"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.\"* The Greek term used for *flesh* (*sarx) emphasizes physical, tangible humanity. It does not mean He appeared in the guise of flesh, but that He actually *became* it.\n*   **Apostolic Witness:** The Apostle John wrote his epistles largely to combat early forms of Docetism. In **1 John 4:2-3**, he provides the test for orthodoxy: *\"This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God.\"*\n*   **Physical Evidence:** Jesus Himself invited His disciples to touch His wounds after the resurrection to prove He was not a spirit (Luke 24:39). He ate food (Luke 24:42-43), sweated blood (Luke 22:44), and experienced thirst (John 19:28). These are physical biological realities, not merely spiritual illusions.\n\n### 3. Theological Consequences (Soteriology)\nWhy does the Church consider this view not just a mistake, but a damnable heresy? Because it undermines the mechanism of Salvation (*Soteriology*).\n\n*   **The Necessity of the Cross:** In Christian theology, the death of Christ was the sacrificial payment for the sins of humanity. A phantom cannot die; a spirit cannot bleed. If Jesus did not have a true physical body, He did not truly die on the cross. If He did not truly die, the debt of sin was not paid, and the Resurrection was not a resurrection of the body but merely a materialization.\n*   **The Mediator:** As **1 Timothy 2:5** states, there is one mediator between God and man: *the man* Christ Jesus. For Jesus to represent humanity before God, He had to be truly human. To represent God before humanity, He had to be truly God. Docetism denies His ability to represent humanity.\n\n### 4. Historical Context and Condemnation\nThe early Church Fathers vigorously opposed this teaching:\n\n*   **Ignatius of Antioch (c. 110 AD):** In his letter to the Smyrneans, Ignatius famously attacked Docetism, writing, *\"But if, as some who are atheists, that is, infidels, say, that He suffered only in appearance... why am I in bonds?... I die for no reason if He did not truly suffer.\"*\n*   **Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 180 AD):** In *Against Heresies*, Irenaeus argued that Christ recapitulated humanity to undo the sin of Adam. If Jesus were not fully human, He could not reverse the curse brought on by the human Adam.\n\n### 5. The Orthodox Standard (Chalcedonian Definition)\nThe orthodox teaching, affirmed at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD, is that Jesus Christ is one person in two natures (*hypostatic union*):\n\n*   **Truly God:** Consubstantial with the Father.\n*   **Truly Man:** Consubstantial with us, \"like us in all respects, apart from sin.\"\n\nHe possesses a rational soul and a body. He did not just *seem* to have a body; He was incarnate.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe teacher’s statement is a classic example of **Docetism**. It denies the full humanity of Christ and subsequently renders the Incarnation, the Atonement, and the Resurrection null and void. Therefore, it stands in direct opposition to the orthodox Christian faith.",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the teacher’s claim as Docetism, a denial of Christ’s true humanity. It accurately summarizes the orthodox position (the hypostatic union) and supports it with key biblical passages (John 1:14; 1 John 4:2-3; Luke 24:39; Luke 24:42-43; John 19:28; Luke 22:44) to demonstrate Jesus’ tangible humanity and real bodily experiences. It also appeals to soteriological implications (death, atonement, resurrection) and to the necessity of Christ’s true humanity (1 Timothy 2:5). The historical dimension is well handled, referencing early opponents (Ignatius, Irenaeus) and the Chalcedonian Definition for orthodox Christology. Nuance is present: it notes the roots in anti-materialist thinking (Platonism/Gnosticism) and emphasizes that orthodox faith teaches two natures in one person, not a merely spiritual Christ. A minor caveat is that some early docetic variants differed in their specifics about the resurrection, so the line about a “materialization” of the Resurrection is a simplification of a spectrum of docetic views; nonetheless, the conclusion remains accurate. Overall, the response is faithful to biblical teaching, historically informed, and nuanced. "
