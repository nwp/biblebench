          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer correctly reflects core themes of Revelation: encouraging persecuted believers, Christ’s ultimate victory over evil, the future judgment of Satan and the powers of evil, and the establishment of God’s eternal kingdom. These themes are consistent with biblical passages (e.g., Christ’s victory in Revelation 19–20, the judgment scene in 20, and the promised new creation in 21–22) and align with historic Christian teaching on the book’s purpose to provide hope and endurance in the face of persecution. The response could be slightly more explicit about the return of Christ and the call to perseverance found in the letters to the churches (Rev 2–3) or the apocalyptic symbolism itself, but these are not doctrinal errors. Overall, the answer is accurate, orthodox, and captures the primary eschatological aim of Revelation."
