Encouragement During Persecution**\n- The most widely accepted purpose among scholars is to encourage early Christians facing Roman persecution, likely under Domitian (81-96 CE)\n- The work assures persecuted believers that Christ ultimately triumphs and that their suffering has meaning\n- Symbols like the \"beast\" represent oppressive earthly powers, while God's throne symbolizes ultimate divine authority\n\n**2. Theological Affirmation**\n- To reinforce Christian conviction that Christ is Lord, not the Roman emperor\n- To proclaim Christ's cosmic sovereignty and his role as judge and redeemer\n- To remind believers of God's control over history despite present circumstances\n\n**3. Call to Faithfulness**\n- To exhort Christians to resist compromise with pagan society\n- To maintain witness and moral integrity despite social and economic pressure\n- To persevere through trials with the assurance of future vindication\n\n## Secondary Elements\n\n- **Liturgical function**: The work likely had a role in worship and community gatherings\n- **Prophetic witness**: To convey divine revelation about end times and God's ultimate purposes\n- **Community identity**: To strengthen group cohesion among dispersed Christian communities\n\n## Scholarly Note\n\nWhile most scholars emphasize the persecution context, some debate whether this was the *only* purpose or whether apocalyptic instruction about end times was equally central. The two purposes are likely complementary rather than mutually exclusive.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer captures the central historical purposes commonly associated with Revelation: encouragement of persecuted Christians, theological affirmation of Christ’s lordship and cosmic sovereignty, and exhortation to faithfulness amid pressure. It also notes secondary elements (liturgical function, prophetic witness, community identity) and acknowledges scholarly debate about whether persecution context is the sole purpose, presenting a complementary view of purposes. The dating context (Domitianic persecution) is accurately described as a widely held view, though dating and emphasis on persecution vs. end-times instruction are debated in scholarship. The expected answer emphasizes the explicit return of Christ; the response implicitly covers that through statements about ultimate victory and Christ as redeemer, but does not explicitly state “the return of Christ” as a distinct phrase. This omission is minor given the breadth of content. Overall, the factual content is accurate, fairly comprehensive, and appropriately nuanced for a historical/contextual evaluation."
