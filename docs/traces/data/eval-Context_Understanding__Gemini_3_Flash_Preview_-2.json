            "Overemphasis on 'primarily establishing a missionary base' as the main purpose; Romans is best understood as a theological exposition addressed to a Roman Christian community, with secondary missionary aims tied to Paul’s future plans.",
            "The phrase 'house churches in Rome' is plausible but not explicitly stated in Romans; the text speaks of 'saints in Rome' and likely ministry to a Roman church comprised of multiple house churches, which is a reasonable inference rather than a stated fact."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns with mainstream scholarly consensus: Romans is written to believers in Rome (the church there) and aims to articulate the gospel, address Jew–Gentile tensions, and prepare for Paul’s visit, including his plan to move toward Spain. It captures the gospel-centric purpose and the corrective/teaching aims of the letter. The main caveat is treating Paul’s intent to visit Spain as the primary purpose; the letter’s primary function is theological exposition and pastoral instruction for the Roman church, with plans for future mission as a significant but secondary component."
