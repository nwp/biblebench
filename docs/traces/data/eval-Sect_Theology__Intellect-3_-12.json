    "input": "Some Oneness Pentecostals teach that baptism must be performed 'in Jesus' name only' and that Trinitarian baptism formulas are invalid. What does Scripture teach?",
    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "Here's a balanced analysis of the Oneness Pentecostal baptismal formula teaching compared to Orthodox Christian Theology:\n\n**Oneness Pentecostal Position:**\n*   **Formula:** Insists baptism must be performed *only* \"in the name of Jesus\" (e.g., \"I baptize you in the name of Jesus Christ\").\n*   **Rejection:** Views Trinitarian formulas (\"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\") as invalid and ineffective for salvation.\n*   **Biblical Basis:** Primarily cites Acts 2:38 (\"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ...\"), Acts 8:16, Acts 10:48, and Acts 19:5. They interpret these passages as the *only* valid formula, seeing Matthew 28:19 as either descriptive (Jesus' name *encompasses* the Father, Son, and Spirit) or an interpolation.\n*   **Theology:** Rooted in Modalism/Sabellianism (historically condemned as heresy). God manifests in different *modes* (Father in creation, Son in redemption, Spirit in sanctification), not distinct persons eternally. Therefore, baptizing \"in Jesus' name\" is sufficient, as Jesus is the ultimate revelation of God.\n\n**Orthodox Christian Position:**\n*   **Formula:** Affirms the Trinitarian formula given by Jesus in Matthew 28:19 (\"in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\") as the authoritative, binding command and the normative practice of the Church from the beginning.\n*   **Acceptance:** Views Trinitarian baptism as valid and essential for entrance into the Church. While recognizing baptisms performed with a Oneness formula *might* be considered valid if performed with the intention of following Christ's command (depending on ecclesial recognition), the *prescribed* and *clear* command is Trinitarian.\n*   **Biblical Basis:**\n    *   **Matthew 28:19:** The explicit, universal commission from the risen Christ. This is the foundational text for Christian baptism.\n    *   **Trinitarian Passages:** Numerous New Testament passages affirm the distinct, co-equal, co-eternal persons of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (e.g., Matthew 3:16-17, John 14-16, 2 Corinthians 13:14, Galatians 4:4-6, Titus 3:5-6, Romans 1:4-5, Revelation 1:4-5).\n    *   **Acts Passages:** While Acts records baptisms \"in the name of Jesus,\" this is understood as:\n        *   *Descriptive:* Identifying the authority *under which* baptism occurs (the Lord Jesus Christ), not necessarily excluding the Father and Spirit.\n        *   *Reflecting Historical Context:* Early preaching emphasized Jesus' lordship and the fulfillment of promises in Him. The full Trinitarian understanding was developing but present in the theology (e.g., Peter's sermon in Acts 2:32-33, 36-39 explicitly links Jesus, the Father, and the promise of the Spirit).\n        *   *Not Contradicting Matthew 28:19:* The Acts accounts do not *replace* Matthew 28:19; they provide supplementary historical snapshots.\n*   **Theology:** Rooted in Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed. Affirms one God in three co-equal, co-eternal, distinct persons: Father, Son (Jesus Christ), Holy Spirit. Each person is fully God, yet not the other. This is considered essential to the Gospel (2 Corinthians 13:14, Ephesians 4:4-6). The Trinitarian formula reflects this core mystery of God's nature.\n\n**Areas of Agreement:**\n1.  **Essential of Salvation:** Both affirm repentance, faith in Jesus Christ, and water baptism as essential components of salvation and entry into the New Covenant community.\n2.  **Authority of Scripture:** Both seek to base their practice on the Bible.\n3.  **Centrality of Jesus:** Both emphasize the absolute necessity and sufficiency of Jesus Christ's death, resurrection, and lordship for salvation.\n\n**Areas of Departure:**\n1.  **Understanding of God (Theology Proper):** This is the *fundamental* difference.\n    *   *Orthodox:* Affirms the Trinity: One God, three distinct, co-equal, co-eternal persons. Modalism is rejected as incompatible with scripture and tradition.\n    *   *Oneness:* Affirms Oneness/Modalism: One God who manifests sequentially in different *modes* (Father, Son, Spirit). This is seen as the only way to maintain strict unity.\n2.  **Interpretation of Key Passages:**\n    *   *Matthew 28:19:* Orthodox sees it as the explicit, binding command. Oneness sees it as descriptive of Jesus' name encompassing the Godhead or potentially an interpolation.\n    *   *Acts Passages:* Oneness sees them as prescriptive (only formula). Orthodox sees them as descriptive (baptism occurring *in the sphere of* Jesus' lordship/name) or reflecting early emphasis, not replacing Matthew 28:19.\n3.  **Validity of Trinitarian Baptism:** Orthodox affirms its validity as commanded by Christ. Oneness rejects it as invalid.\n4.  **Historical Practice:** Orthodoxy traces the Trinitarian formula unbroken from the apostolic era (supported by the Didache, early church fathers like Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and all major traditions). Oneness sees the early church practicing \"in Jesus' name\" and views the development of Trinitarian formula as a later apostasy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nScripture presents a tension between the explicit command in Matthew 28:19 and the descriptive accounts in Acts. The **Orthodox Christian position**, grounded in the totality of scripture, the witness of the early church, and the development of Trinitarian doctrine as essential to salvation, holds that the Trinitarian formula is the divinely mandated and sufficient expression of the doctrine of God revealed in baptism. It views the Oneness position as departing from the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity (Modalism), leading to an interpretation of scripture that downplays or reinterprets Matthew 28:19 in favor of the Acts passages. The Oneness position sees its view as a return to apostolic simplicity and a rejection of later Trinitarian \"compromise.\"\n\nThis difference stems primarily from a fundamental divergence in understanding the nature of God, which then shapes the interpretation of baptismal passages. Both sides appeal to scripture, but their interpretations are governed by their distinct theological frameworks. Historically, the Oneness view has been deemed incompatible with the core doctrine of the Trinity, which is considered essential to the Christian faith.",

However, it makes some contested or nuanced claims (e.g., Matthew 28:19 as potentially an interpolation; variability in early baptismal practice as clearly favoring Jesus-only formulas) that should be treated with more caution. It correctly highlights major doctrinal disagreements and preserves essential nuance about descriptive vs prescriptive usage, while noting the central orthodox emphasis on the Triune formula."
