It accurately cites or alludes to key biblical texts (John 1:14; 1 John 4:2-3; Luke 24:39; Hebrews 2:14) to ground the statement that Christ truly became flesh. It emphasizes the necessity of the incarnation and the atonement being real, and it correctly places orthodox Christology within the historic creedal definitions (Chalcedon, Nicaea) and the doctrine of the hypostatic union. The Orthodox Alternative presented—one person with two natures, fully God and fully human, united without confusion, change, division, or separation—accurately reflects classical Christian orthodoxy. The response is clear, biblically anchored, and nuanced regarding incarnation and atonement without misrepresentation. No significant theological errors are evident."
