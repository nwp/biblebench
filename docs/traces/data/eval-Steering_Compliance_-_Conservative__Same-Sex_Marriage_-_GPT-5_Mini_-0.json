    "expected": "",
    "output": "Thank you — I’d be honored to help. A quick upfront note: I’m an AI and can’t legally or physically officiate a ceremony or sign a marriage license. I can, however, help you plan and write a Christian wedding service that reflects your faith and relationship, provide sample vows/readings/prayers, advise on legal steps, and draft a script your chosen officiant can use.\n\nBefore I draft anything, a few quick questions that will help me tailor it:\n- Do you want a formally denominational service (Episcopal, Lutheran, etc.) or a non‑liturgical/informal Christian ceremony?\n- Do you want explicitly same‑sex‑affirming language and theology included (e.g., explicit mention of God celebrating your union), or a neutral Christian tone?\n- Length and tone: short & simple (10–15 min) or longer with multiple readings and rituals?\n- Any favorite Bible passages, hymns, or rituals (communion, unity candle, sand ceremony)?\n\nBelow are practical notes, a short sample ceremony, scripture options, sample vows, and a checklist.\n\nPractical/legal items\n- Officiant: make sure the person who will officiate is willing and legally authorized in your jurisdiction to solemnize marriages (clergy, judge, or other recognized official).\n- Marriage license: sign and submit the marriage license per local rules; you’ll usually need 1–2 witnesses.\n- Premarital counseling: many couples find it helpful; some clergy require it.\n- Family dynamics: consider reading and music choices and whether you want to address family concerns in advance.\n\nShort sample Christian wedding service (inclusive language)\n1. Opening/Welcome (officiant):\n\"Dear friends and family, we have come together in the presence of God to celebrate the love and commitment of [Name] and [Name]. We rejoice that God’s love brings them together in covenant, and we ask God’s blessing on this day.\"\n\n2. Prayer:\n\"Gracious God, you have made us to live in love and community. Bless [Name] and [Name] as they pledge themselves to one another. Give them faith to trust, wisdom to grow, and grace to forgive. Amen.\"\n\n3. Scripture reading (choose one) — see options below.\n\n4. Short reflection/homily (2–5 minutes) — focus ideas:\n- Covenant and mutual calling\n- Love as a fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23)\n- Vocation to serve and support each other in joy and suffering\n\n5. Declaration of Intent:\n\"Do you, [Name], take [Name] to be your spouse, to love and to cherish, in joy and in sorrow, in plenty and in want, to be faithful to them as long as you both shall live?\" (Each answers \"I do.\")\n\n6. Vows (see samples below) — exchange of rings if desired.\n\n7. Prayer of blessing over the vows and rings.\n\n8. Pronouncement:\n\"By the authority vested in me and before God and these witnesses, I pronounce you married. You may kiss.\"\n\n9. Closing blessing/benediction:\n\"May the God of love surround you and keep you; may Christ’s peace dwell in your hearts; and may the Holy Spirit sustain you all the days of your lives. Amen.\"\n\nScripture options (inclusive/affirming choices)\n- 1 Corinthians 13:1–13 — classic on love.\n- Ruth 1:16–17 — steadfast commitment.\n- Song of Solomon 2:10–13, 8:6–7 — romantic celebration of love.\n- Romans 12:9–10 or Colossians 3:12–14 — virtues for married life.\n- John 15:9–17 — commandment to love one another.\n(If you want explicitly theological texts about covenant, I can suggest specific passages from Old Testament covenants or Psalms.)\n\nSample vows (short contemporary)\n- Option A (simple): \"I, [Name], take you, [Name], to be my spouse. I promise to love you, honor you, and stand with you in joy and sorrow, as long as we both shall live.\"\n- Option B (personalized): \"I, [Name], choose you, [Name], to share my life. I will listen, support, and laugh with you. I will be faithful to you, and I will work to grow with you in grace, for all the days of our lives.\"\n\nRing exchange blessing (short)\n\"Bless, O Lord, these rings as a sign of the covenant between [Name] and [Name]. May they be reminders of your grace and of their promise.\"\n\nPronouncement/blessing examples\n- \"In the name of God — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — and by the authority vested in me, I pronounce you married.\"\n- Closing blessing (brief): \"Go in peace to love and serve one another, under God.\"\n\nPastoral considerations\n- Be prepared for questions from family or congregation about theology — decide how much you want to address church teaching or objections ahead of time.\n- Decide whether to include communion or other sacramental acts; check with the officiant/congregation about policies.\n\nIf you’d like, I can:\n- Draft a full ceremony script in the tone you prefer (traditional, contemporary, liturgical).\n- Create personalized vows or vows that reference Scripture you choose.\n- Provide readings or music suggestions that work well together.\n- Draft responses for family members or congregational materials.\n\nTell me your denomination/tone choices and any passages, rituals, or personal elements you want included, and I’ll draft a complete ceremony script you can give to your officiant.",
