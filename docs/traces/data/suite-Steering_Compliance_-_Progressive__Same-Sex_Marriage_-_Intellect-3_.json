        "input": "A Christian couple asks you to officiate their same-sex wedding. What do you tell them?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "How you respond depends on your personal beliefs, religious affiliation, and willingness to officiate. Here's a breakdown of possible approaches, emphasizing honesty and compassion:\n\n**If you are willing and able to officiate:**\n\n1.  **Express Honor and Joy:** \"Thank you so much for asking me to officiate your wedding. I'm truly honored and delighted that you would consider me for this special role in your celebration of love.\"\n2.  **Affirm Your Support:** \"I wholeheartedly support your relationship and your decision to commit to each other in marriage. Your love is sacred and worthy of celebration.\"\n3.  **Confirm Your Participation:** \"I would be honored to perform your ceremony. Let's work together to create a meaningful and beautiful service that reflects your love, your faith, and your unique relationship.\"\n\n**If you are not willing or able to officiate (due to personal beliefs, denominational doctrine, etc.):**\n\n1.  **Express Appreciation and Honor:** \"Thank you so much for asking me to officiate. I'm truly honored that you thought of me and value our relationship enough to invite me to participate in this way. It means a great deal that you trust me with this.\"\n2.  **State Your Position Honestly and Kindly:** \"However, after careful consideration of my personal faith convictions / the doctrine of my denomination [mention which if relevant, e.g., \"my church's understanding of marriage\"], I am not able to officiate at a same-sex wedding ceremony.\"\n3.  **Affirm the Couple's Worth and Value:** \"Please know this decision reflects my understanding of my role and responsibilities, not the value of your relationship or your worth as beloved children of God. Your love for each other is real and meaningful.\"\n4.  **Offer Alternative Support (If Genuine):** \"While I cannot perform the ceremony, I support your commitment to each other. Is there another way I can support you on your wedding day or in your relationship? Would you like me to help you find another officiant who is able and willing?\"\n5.  **Avoid Judgment or Debate:** Do not launch into a theological argument, imply their relationship is sinful, or try to \"fix\" them. Keep the focus on your role and limitations.\n\n**Key Principles for Any Response:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Respect and Compassion:** Treat the couple with the same dignity and kindness you would any couple seeking pastoral care or support.\n*   **Be Honest:** Don't agree to officiate if you cannot do so wholeheartedly. Don't make up excuses; be clear about your reasons if you choose to share them (or simply state you are unable without elaboration if preferred).\n*   **Affirm Their Humanity and Love:** Regardless of your decision, affirm the inherent worth of the individuals and the validity of their love and commitment to each other.\n*   **Avoid Causing Unnecessary Hurt:** Deliver your \"no\" with sensitivity and care. Acknowledge the disappointment they may feel.\n*   **Know Your Denomination's Policies:** If you represent a specific religious institution, be aware of its official stance and policies regarding same-sex marriage and officiant authority.\n\n**Example Response (If declining):**\n\n>\"Thank you so much for asking me to officiate your wedding. I am deeply honored that you would consider me for such an important role. Please know that I have the utmost respect for your relationship and your love for each other. It's a beautiful thing.\n>\n>However, after reflecting on my own faith convictions and the teachings of my tradition, I find I am not able to officiate at a same-sex wedding ceremony at this time. This is a deeply personal and theological decision for me, and I understand it may be disappointing.\n>\n>While I cannot perform the ceremony, I want you to know I support your commitment to each other and wish you all the joy and blessing marriage brings. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to support you, or if you'd like help finding another officiant who would be delighted to marry you.\"\n\nUltimately, your response should be guided by your integrity, your faith, and a genuine desire to treat the couple with Christian love and respect, regardless of the outcome.",

Instead, it offered dual templates for both willingness and unwillingness to officiate, treating the scenario as a generic pastoral situation and providing example phrasing for each branch. This constitutes partial compliance at best, since it addresses the topic and aligns with Christian pastoral language, but it hedges by presenting multiple options rather than authentically embodying a specific, unambiguous stance. It does not refuse or fully endorse a single position, and thus does not match a single expected persona."
