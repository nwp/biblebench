    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity affirms the bodily, physical resurrection of Jesus as essential to the faith (1 Corinthians 15:14). Jesus appeared in a physical body that could be touched (Luke 24:39, John 20:27), ate food (Luke 24:42-43), and still bore the crucifixion wounds. The empty tomb accounts confirm the body was gone because Jesus was raised, not that it was discarded. Jesus explicitly denied being merely a spirit: 'a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have' (Luke 24:39). The physical resurrection guarantees believers' future bodily resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:20-23) and validates Jesus' victory over death. Denying the physical resurrection undermines the gospel.",
    "output": "## Analysis: The Resurrection of Jesus in Orthodox Christianity vs. Jehovah's Witness Teaching\n\n**Orthodox Christian Teaching on the Resurrection:**\n\n1.  **Physical, Bodily Resurrection:** Orthodox Christianity (Catholic, Orthodox, and major Protestant traditions) unequivocally teaches that Jesus Christ was **physically and bodily resurrected** from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion. His resurrection body, while transformed and glorified (possessing new properties like the ability to appear and disappear instantly, yet still capable of eating and being touched), was fundamentally the *same* physical body that was crucified, buried, and decayed. He was not a disembodied spirit.\n    *   *Biblical Basis:* Luke 24:36-43 (Jesus eats fish, invites touch); John 20:19-29 (Thomas touches wounds); 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, 12-20 (Paul emphasizes \"flesh and bones,\" not \"flesh and blood,\" and calls Jesus the \"firstfruits\" of the resurrection); Matthew 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-8; John 20:1-18; Acts 2:24-32 (Peter's sermon emphasizing bodily resurrection).\n\n2.  **Victory over Death and Hades:** The physical resurrection is the definitive victory over sin, death, and the power of Satan/Hades. By rising physically, Jesus demonstrated God's power over death itself and fulfilled the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning the Messiah.\n\n3.  **Foundation of the Christian Faith:** The physical resurrection is the core event upon which the Christian faith rests. Paul states: \"And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins\" (1 Corinthians 15:17). It validates Jesus' claims, his sacrifice for sin, and his identity as the Son of God.\n\n4.  **Promise of Future Resurrection:** The resurrection of Jesus is the \"firstfruits\" (1 Cor. 15:20) and the guarantee of the future resurrection of *all* believers. Believers will be raised with transformed, glorified physical bodies like Christ's (Philippians 3:21; 1 John 3:2). Matter is not inherently evil; God's redemption includes the physical creation and human bodies.\n\n5.  **Ascension:** Following his resurrection appearances, Jesus physically ascended into heaven in his glorified body (Acts 1:9-11), where he now intercedes for believers (Romans 8:34; Hebrews 7:25).\n\n**Jehovah's Witness Teaching:**\n\n1.  **Spiritual Resurrection:** Jehovah's Witnesses teach that Jesus was **not physically resurrected**. Instead, God disposed of Jesus' physical body (causing it to disappear or disintegrate), and Jesus was **re-created as a powerful spirit creature** in heaven. His post-resurrection appearances were either in physical bodies temporarily created by God for the purpose, or as manifestations of his spirit.\n    *   *Biblical Basis Cited:* They emphasize verses like 1 Peter 3:18 (\"...put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit\") and 1 Corinthians 15:44-45 (\"...a spiritual body... the last Adam became a life-giving spirit\"). They interpret \"flesh and blood\" in 1 Cor. 15:50 as meaning human, mortal existence, not necessarily a physical body. They see the tomb as empty because God disposed of the body.\n\n2.  **Jesus' Exalted State:** While highly exalted to heaven as God's first and only direct creation (a spirit creature), Jesus is not Almighty God but a created being, now a powerful spirit. His sacrifice was accepted, but his resurrection did not involve reclaiming his physical body.\n\n**Comparison and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Area of Agreement:** Both traditions agree that Jesus died, was buried, and that God miraculously intervened after his death to grant him a new, exalted existence. Both agree that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his death. Both agree that the resurrection is central to salvation.\n*   **Fundamental Departure:**\n    *   **Nature of the Resurrection:** The core point of departure is the *nature* of Jesus' post-resurrection existence. Orthodox Christianity asserts a **physical, bodily resurrection** of the *same body* that died. Jehovah's Witnesses assert a **spiritual re-creation** as a spirit creature, with the physical body disposed of.\n    *   **Nature of Jesus:** This difference flows from a deeper Christological difference. Orthodox Christianity holds to the hypostatic union: Jesus is one person with two natures, divine and human, inseparably united. His resurrection was the resurrection of his *human nature*. Jehovah's Witnesses reject the Trinity and the deity of Jesus. They see him as a created spirit creature (Michael the Archangel before becoming Jesus) who took on a human body, which was sacrificed and then permanently dissolved. His essence is spirit, not God-man.\n    *   **Nature of the Future Resurrection:** Orthodox Christianity sees the future resurrection as a **bodily resurrection** like Christ's. Jehovah's Witnesses see the future resurrection for the vast majority of faithful Witnesses as a **resurrection to life on a paradise earth as perfect humans** (in physical bodies), while 144,000 are raised to heaven as spirit creatures like Jesus. The physical resurrection of believers is not guaranteed in the same way as in orthodoxy.\n    *   **Meaning of the Empty Tomb:** Orthodox Christianity sees the empty tomb as physical evidence of the bodily resurrection. Jehovah's Witnesses see the empty tomb as evidence God disposed of the body, not that it was resurrected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOrthodox Christian theology teaches that Jesus' resurrection was a **physical, bodily resurrection** of the same human body that was crucified and buried. This event is the cornerstone of the Christian faith, demonstrating victory over death, validating Jesus' sacrifice and claims, and guaranteeing the future physical resurrection of believers. It is intrinsically linked to the doctrine of the Incarnation (God becoming fully human) and the hypostatic union (divine and human natures in one person).\n\nJehovah's Witness teaching fundamentally departs from this by asserting that Jesus was **re-created as a spirit creature**, with his physical body disposed of by God. This view stems from their non-Trinitarian and subordinationist Christology, where Jesus is a created being. While they agree on the *significance* of God's action after Jesus' death, they interpret the nature of Jesus' post-resurrection state and the mechanism of the resurrection event in a way that is fundamentally incompatible with the physical, bodily resurrection taught by orthodox Christianity. This difference has profound implications for understanding the nature of Jesus, the nature of salvation, and the believer's future hope.",

            "The claim that orthodox resurrection entails 'the same physical body' that died is a simplification. Classical orthodox teaching emphasizes a physical, bodily resurrection in a glorified form, with continuity of Christ’s person, but not necessarily literal, exact atomic continuity of the pre-death body. Some theologians emphasize continuity while others stress transformation; the statement as written can be read as over-claiming sameness.",
            "The sentence asserting Jesus 'did not decay' (implicitly in contrast to a claim of decay) is phrased inaccurately. Scripture (e.g., Acts 2:27, 31; Psalm 16:10) is cited to support that Jesus would not see corruption, so the wording should reflect that orthodox certainty about Jesus' not decaying, rather than implying decay occurred and was later reversed.",
            "A nuanced point sometimes treated differently in polemics is the nature of the resurrected body (glorified, capable ofities such as appearing/disappearing). The LLM hints at this but could be more precise by noting that orthodox teaching affirms a real, physical, albeit glorified body rather than a 'same' or 'unchanged' body, avoiding overspecification about instantaneous appearances."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer is mostly accurate and aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy on a bodily resurrection and the core distinctions with Jehovah’s Witnesses. The primary weaknesses relate to a potentially misleading emphasis that the resurrected body is exactly the same as the pre-resurrection body (and a minor,ologically misleading phrase about decay). A more precise formulation would stress a real, physical, glorified body with continuity of person, not necessarily identical atoms, and should explicitly affirm that Jesus did not undergo corruption as a prerequisite of resurrection (Psalm 16:10; Acts 2:27, 31). Overall, the response is strong in capturing the main doctrinal stance, biblical grounding, and key nuances distinguishing orthodox Christianity from JW teaching."
