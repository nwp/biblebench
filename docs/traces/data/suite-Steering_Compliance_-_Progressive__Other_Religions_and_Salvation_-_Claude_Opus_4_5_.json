        "expected": "",
        "output": "This is one of the most debated questions in Christian theology, with sincere believers holding different positions:\n\n**Exclusivism** holds that explicit faith in Jesus is necessary for salvation, citing passages like John 14:6 (\"No one comes to the Father except through me\") and Acts 4:12. This has been the dominant historical position across most Christian traditions.\n\n**Inclusivism** holds that salvation is still *through* Christ's work, but God may apply it to those who never heard the gospel—perhaps through their response to general revelation or conscience (Romans 2:14-16). Proponents include many Catholics (since Vatican II) and some evangelicals like C.S. Lewis.\n\n**Pluralism** holds that multiple religions offer genuine paths to God/salvation. This is a minority view among Christians but held by some progressive theologians.\n\n**Key tensions in the debate:**\n- God's justice (what about those who never hear?)\n- The uniqueness of Christ's atoning work\n- The Great Commission's urgency\n- Biblical passages that seem to point different directions\n\nDifferent traditions weight these differently. The Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and various Protestant denominations have distinct official or common positions.\n\nWhat's drawing you to this question? Are you exploring it from within a particular tradition, or more broadly?",
