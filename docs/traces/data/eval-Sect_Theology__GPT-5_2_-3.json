    "expected": "LDS theology teaches that Jesus and Lucifer (Satan) are spirit brothers, both created by God the Father in a pre-mortal existence. This is incompatible with orthodox Christianity for several reasons: (1) Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17 says all things were created through him); (2) Jesus is worshiped as God (Hebrews 1:6) while Satan is a fallen angel; (3) This teaching diminishes Christ's unique divine nature and blurs the absolute distinction between the Creator and creation. Orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus as the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity, while Satan is a created angelic being who rebelled.",
    "output": "## How Latter-day Saints (LDS) understand Jesus and Lucifer\n\nIn Latter-day Saint theology, **Jesus (Jehovah)** and **Lucifer** are understood to have a relationship rooted in a shared **premortal existence**:\n\n1. **Premortal life as spirit children of God**\n   - LDS teaching holds that human beings (and certain heavenly beings) existed before mortal life as **spirit sons and daughters of Heavenly Father**.\n   - Within that framework, **Jesus and Lucifer are both “spirit children” of God**, meaning they are, in LDS terms, **spirit brothers** (though not morally equal).\n\n2. **Different roles and moral trajectories**\n   - Jesus is typically taught to be the **Firstborn** and uniquely chosen as the Savior—fully divine and the central object of worship in LDS faith.\n   - Lucifer is taught to have been a prominent premortal figure (often associated with “son of the morning”), who **rebelled** against God’s plan. He becomes **Satan/the devil**, opposing God’s purposes.\n\n3. **The “council in heaven” and competing proposals**\n   - LDS scripture and teaching describe a heavenly council in which God presented a plan for human life, agency, and redemption.\n   - Jesus supported God’s plan; Lucifer proposed an alternative (commonly summarized as coercing obedience and taking God’s glory), and was cast out with those who followed him.\n\nSo, the LDS view is not that Jesus and Lucifer are equals, but that they are **members of the same premortal “family” of spirits**, with radically different choices and outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## Why this is problematic from an orthodox (Nicene) Christian perspective\n\n“Orthodox Christianity” here means classical, historic Christianity as expressed in the ecumenical creeds (especially **Nicaea/Constantinople**) and mainstream Catholic/Orthodox/Protestant theology. From that standpoint, the LDS framework departs at multiple foundational points.\n\n### 1. Christ’s nature: eternal Son vs. a spirit child among spirit children\nOrthodox Christianity teaches:\n- The Son is **eternally begotten of the Father**, not created.\n- Jesus Christ is **of the same essence (consubstantial)** with the Father—fully God, uncreated, eternal.\n\nLDS teaching, by contrast, is commonly understood (in orthodox analysis) to place Jesus within a broader category of divine offspring in a premortal order. Even though Latter-day Saints affirm Jesus’ divinity and worship him, the **metaphysical setup** is different: Jesus is not the eternally begotten Son in the Nicene sense.\n\n**Orthodox concern:** If the Son belongs to the same “species” or order of beings as other premortal spirits, then his **uniqueness as uncreated God** is obscured or denied.\n\n### 2. Satan’s nature: created angel vs. spirit sibling\nOrthodox Christianity teaches:\n- Satan is a **created angelic being** (a fallen angel).\n- Angels are creatures; they are not “siblings” of the uncreated Son of God.\n- There is an absolute **Creator/creature distinction**: God alone is uncreated; everything else is created.\n\nLDS theology, with its premortal family framework, makes it natural to speak of Lucifer and Jesus as “brothers” in a way that suggests a shared origin as spirit children.\n\n**Orthodox concern:** Calling Jesus and Lucifer “brothers” sounds (to orthodox ears) like it places Christ and Satan on the same ontological level—different in goodness and authority, but too close in *being*. Even if LDS do not mean “equals,” the language is seen as collapsing the Creator/creature boundary that orthodox theology insists on.\n\n### 3. The Trinity and the “Godhead”\nOrthodox Christianity teaches:\n- One God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—**one being/essence**.\n\nLDS theology speaks of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost as **distinct beings** united in purpose (often called the “Godhead”), not one essence in the Nicene sense.\n\n**Orthodox concern:** The LDS Jesus is not situated within Nicene Trinitarianism; therefore, the broader LDS account of premortal life, divine parentage, and spirit kinship is understood to arise from (and reinforce) a non-Nicene view of God.\n\n---\n\n## Areas of overlap (important for fairness)\n\nEven with these deep differences, there are genuine points of agreement:\n- Latter-day Saints affirm that **Jesus is the Savior**, divine, and worthy of worship.\n- They affirm Lucifer/Satan is **real**, **rebellious**, and opposed to God.\n- They affirm a dramatic moral contrast: Jesus obeys and redeems; Lucifer rebels and destroys.\n\nSo the disagreement is not mainly over whether Jesus is good and Lucifer evil, but over **what kind of being Jesus eternally is**, and how Satan relates to God and creation.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- **LDS view:** Jesus and Lucifer are “spirit brothers” in a premortal family of spirit children of Heavenly Father; Jesus is the chosen Savior, Lucifer rebels and becomes Satan.\n- **Orthodox Christian objection:** This conflicts with the Nicene confession that Jesus is the **uncreated, eternal Son**, while Lucifer is a **created angel**. The “brother” framing is problematic because it appears to place Christ and Satan within the same order of beings and undermines the classic Creator/creature distinction and Nicene Trinitarian Christology.\n\nIf you want, I can quote representative LDS sources (e.g., Pearl of Great Price passages often cited) alongside Nicene/creedal statements to show exactly where the conceptual divergence occurs.",

            "The claim that Jesus is the 'central object of worship in LDS faith' can be misleading or oversimplified. LDS worship focuses on God the Father and Jesus as the Godhead in LDS theology, but the emphasis and mode of worship differ from Nicene orthodoxy; stating Jesus as the singular 'central object' may overstate the LDS stance for some readers.",
            "The characterization of Lucifer as a 'fallen angel' can be an oversimplification within LDS discourse. In Mormon theology, Lucifer is described as a pre-mortal spirit son of God who rebelled; some nuance exists in terminology between 'spirit child' and 'angel' at different doctrinal moments. The line could be read as collapsing distinctions some Latter-day Saints make between premortal status and post-m mortal identity.",
            "The response treats the LDS view as if scripture directly supports 'premortal existence' in the same way it supports orthodox creedal claims. While the orthodox critique is scripturally grounded (e.g., John 1:1-3; Colossians 1:16-17; Hebrews 1:6), the LDS novella about premortal life is not established by the cited biblical texts. The answer could more clearly separate what is scripturally explicit (orthodox critique) from what is doctrinally asserted only within LDS revelation and tradition.",
            "Some nuance about the Godhead could be strengthened. LDS theology presents the Godhead as three distinct beings united in purpose, whereas classical Trinitarian doctrine speaks of one essence in three persons. The response notes this but could more precisely distinguish how 'distinct beings' in Mormonism relate to the orthodox 'one essence' concept.",
            "The response does not provide direct LDS sources (e.g., Pearl of Great Price) for the premortal brotherhood claim, which would help readers assess its accuracy within LDS literature."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer overall accurately presents the LDS view and the orthodox Christian critique, and it grounds the orthodox concerns in Scripture (John 1:1-3; Colossians 1:16-17; Hebrews 1:6). It also identifies major points of disagreement, including the Creator/creature distinction, the nature of the Godhead, and Christology. However, it contains some cautious oversimplifications and potential misrepresentations: it frames worship language in a way that may oversimplify LDS worship practice, it risks conflating terms like 'angel' and 'spirit son' as used in LDS discourse, and it could be more explicit about where LDS doctrine goes beyond what Scripture explicitly states. These nuances affect precision but not the overall doctrinal direction of the evaluation. Overall, the response is strong—accurate on the orthodox critique, fairly accurate on the LDS framework, and nuanced about key theological distinctions."
