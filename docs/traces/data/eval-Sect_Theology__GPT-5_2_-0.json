    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "The saying—often called the *Lorenzo Snow couplet*—summarizes a classic Latter-day Saint (LDS) teaching of “eternal progression”: God the Father was once as humans are, and faithful humans may one day become “as God is” (exalted, glorified, participating in divine life and authority).\n\nMeasured against **orthodox (Nicene) Christian theology**—Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestant traditions—this teaching is **not consistent** in its full sense. There are *partial points of resonance* (especially with the Christian doctrine of glorification/theosis), but the couplet also implies key claims that orthodox Christianity rejects.\n\n## 1) Where it departs from orthodox Christian theology\n\n### A. “As man now is, God once was”\nOrthodox Christianity confesses that God is **eternal, uncreated, and immutable**—not a being who “became” God from a prior state as a creature.\n\n- **Creedal**: “We believe in one God… maker of heaven and earth…” (Nicene Creed). God is the ultimate source of all that exists; he is not within the class of created beings.\n- **Biblical themes**: God is the “everlasting God” (Isa 40:28), “from everlasting to everlasting” (Ps 90:2), and the one who does not change in his divine being (Mal 3:6; Jas 1:17).\n- **Classical theology**: God is *aseity* (self-existent), not dependent; *immutability* (not progressing into deity); and *uncreatedness* (not once a man).\n\nSo the claim that God “once was” as humans are—i.e., a finite, embodied, developing being who attained godhood—conflicts with the orthodox doctrine of God.\n\n### B. “As God now is, man may become” (in the LDS sense)\nOrthodox Christianity certainly teaches that humans are destined for **glory**, **holiness**, and **participation in God’s life**. However, it rejects the idea that humans can become “God” in the sense of becoming another deity with God’s own kind of existence.\n\nIn historic Christian teaching:\n- Humans are **adopted** as God’s children by grace (Rom 8:15–17; Gal 4:4–7).\n- Humans are **glorified** (Rom 8:30).\n- Believers can become “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Pet 1:4).\n\nBut these are understood to mean **participation by grace**, not **identity by nature**. We remain *creatures*; God remains the one uncreated Creator.\n\nOrthodox Christianity also maintains **monotheism** in a strong sense: there is only one God, not a potential multiplicity of gods. Any interpretation of “becoming gods” that implies multiple true gods, each worthy of the same kind of worship as the Father, is outside orthodox boundaries.\n\n## 2) Where there is real overlap in language (but not meaning)\n\nThe couplet can sound superficially similar to the **Eastern Orthodox doctrine of theosis** (deification) and to some patristic phrases like “God became man so that man might become god.” But the key distinction is what “become god” means.\n\n### Theosis in orthodox Christianity\n- Humans are united to Christ and transformed by the Holy Spirit.\n- Believers truly share in God’s life (by grace), becoming “godlike.”\n- Yet they **never become God by essence**. They do not become uncreated, independent, or equal to God.\n\nA common Eastern distinction is: participation in God’s **energies** (life, grace, communion) without becoming God’s **essence**. Western theology similarly guards Creator–creature distinction: sanctification and glorification do not erase creaturehood.\n\n### LDS exaltation (as typically understood)\nLDS teaching has historically included ideas such as God’s former human-like condition, divine embodiment, and humans eventually attaining a divine status in continuity with God’s own kind. Even when described carefully, this tends to move beyond “sharing in divine life” toward something closer to **ontological advancement to deity**, which orthodox Christianity denies.\n\n## 3) Bottom line\n- **Not consistent with orthodox Christianity**: The claim that God “once was” a man (or a creature who became God) directly conflicts with the Nicene-Christian understanding of God as eternally God, uncreated and immutable.\n- **Partially overlapping terminology**: The hope that humans may be glorified and deeply participate in God’s life is very much Christian (theosis/glorification).\n- **Crucial difference**: Orthodox Christianity teaches deification **by grace** while remaining **creatures**, within **monotheism**; the LDS couplet is commonly understood to imply a form of divine progression and “becoming God” that exceeds orthodox bounds.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also compare specific LDS sources (e.g., Lorenzo Snow, Joseph Smith’s *King Follett* discourse, later LDS statements) with particular orthodox sources (Nicene Creed, Athanasius, Irenaeus, Aquinas, Palamas) to show exactly where the conceptual lines are drawn.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately characterizes orthodox Christian theology regarding the LDS couplet. It correctly emphasizes God’s eternal, uncreated, and immutable nature and the Creator–creature distinction (Aseity, immutability). It notes that orthodox theology denies any progression to deity for the Creator and rejects a real ontological equivalence between Creator and creature. It acknowledges legitimate orthodox parallels with theosis/glorification while clearly distinguishing grace-imparted participation from ontological becoming divine. It also correctly identifies the use of scripture and creedal language (Nicene Creed, Malachi 3:6, Isaiah 43:10/44:6, 2 Peter 1:4, Rom 8:15–17, etc.) as grounding. The nuances about energies vs essence (Palamite/theosis framework) are appropriately mentioned, and the overall bottom line aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy. Minor caveats could be added (e.g., the precise historical attribution of certain phrases about theosis), but these do not materially affect the accuracy. Overall, a strong, well-grounded, nuanced evaluation.)"
