        "expected": "",
        "output": "Christianity does not have a single unanimously agreed answer, though **the historically dominant view** has been **eternal conscious torment (ECT)**. Whether unbelievers “will” experience that depends on which theological tradition and biblical interpretation you accept.\n\n## 1) Eternal conscious torment (traditional majority view)\n**Claim:** Those who die unreconciled to God will remain **consciously** punished/separated from God **forever**.\n\n**Often-cited texts**\n- **Matthew 25:46** — “eternal punishment” contrasted with “eternal life.”\n- **Mark 9:48** — imagery of unending decay/fire (“their worm does not die…”).\n- **Revelation 14:11** — “the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever…”\n- **Revelation 20:10, 15** — “tormented day and night forever and ever,” lake of fire.\n\n**Common reasoning:** If “eternal life” is unending, “eternal punishment” is likewise unending; Revelation’s imagery suggests ongoing conscious experience.\n\n**Who tends to hold it:** Many Catholics and Protestants (especially in the Augustinian/Reformed and much evangelical tradition). In Catholic theology, hell is often described primarily as **eternal separation from God**, and is understood as conscious.\n\n## 2) Annihilationism / Conditional immortality (a significant minority view)\n**Claim:** The finally impenitent are ultimately **destroyed** (cease to exist), so the punishment is eternal in its **result** (permanent death), not in ongoing conscious experience.\n\n**Often-cited texts**\n- **Matthew 10:28** — God can “destroy both soul and body in hell.”\n- **Romans 6:23** — “the wages of sin is death.”\n- **2 Thessalonians 1:9** — “eternal destruction.”\n- **Malachi 4:1–3** — wicked pictured as burned up like stubble/ashes.\n\n**Common reasoning:** Scripture frequently contrasts “life” with “death,” and “destroy” language seems more like termination than perpetual torment.\n\n**Who tends to hold it:** Seventh-day Adventists and some evangelicals/Anglicans and other Protestants.\n\n## 3) Universal reconciliation (universalism; a minority view)\n**Claim:** God ultimately reconciles all people (sometimes through severe postmortem judgment/purification), so no one remains in hell forever.\n\n**Often-cited texts**\n- **1 Timothy 2:4** — God “desires all people to be saved.”\n- **Romans 5:18** — language about justification/life in parallel with Adam’s condemnation.\n- **1 Corinthians 15:22–28** — “as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive…”\n- **Colossians 1:20** — reconciliation of “all things.”\n\n**Common reasoning:** God’s final victory and reconciling purpose would be incomplete if a portion of humanity remains eternally lost.\n\n**Who tends to hold it:** Some early and modern theologians; a minority position within Orthodoxy and Protestantism (often as a “hope” rather than a dogma).\n\n## Why the disagreement persists\nA lot turns on how to read:\n- **“Eternal” (Greek *aiōnios*)** — unending duration vs “age-long”/pertaining to the age to come.\n- **Biblical imagery** — fire, darkness, destruction, exclusion, “second death”: literal descriptions or metaphors for a reality beyond our categories.\n- **Revelation’s genre** — apocalyptic symbolism vs straightforward prose.\n\n## Bottom line\n- **Many Christians:** yes—unbelievers experience eternal conscious torment.\n- **Many others:** no—either **final destruction** or **eventual restoration**.\n\nIf you tell me your background (e.g., Catholic, Orthodox, evangelical Protestant, “just reading the Bible,” etc.), I can summarize how that tradition typically answers and why.",
