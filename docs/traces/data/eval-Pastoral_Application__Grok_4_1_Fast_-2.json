    "input": "A couple asks: 'We're Christians living together before marriage. Is this really wrong? Everyone does it now, and we're committed to each other.'",
    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "Dear friends,\n\nThank you for coming to me with this honest question—it's a sign of your hearts seeking God's wisdom, and I honor that. I know our culture today normalizes living together before marriage, and with your commitment to each other, it might feel like a loving, practical step. But let's prayerfully turn to Scripture together, because God's Word is our ultimate guide, offering truth that leads to life and blessing (Psalm 119:105).\n\nGod's beautiful design for intimacy is clear: sex and cohabitation are reserved for marriage. Hebrews 13:4 tells us, \"Marriage should be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.\" Living together as an unmarried couple typically involves sharing a bed and life in ways Scripture calls fornication—sexual relations outside of marriage—which grieves God's heart because it falls short of His holy standard (1 Corinthians 6:18: \"Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body\").\n\nJesus reaffirmed this in Matthew 19:4-6, pointing back to Genesis: marriage is the lifelong union of one man and one woman, where \"they become one flesh.\" Anything before that covenant dishonors that sacred oneness. And while \"everyone does it\" is true in our world, Romans 12:2 calls us not to conform to its patterns but to be transformed by renewing our minds to God's will. We're meant to be a light, distinct in holiness (1 Peter 1:15-16: \"Be holy, because I am holy\").\n\nPlease hear this with grace: I'm not condemning you— we've all fallen short (Romans 3:23)—but inviting you to repentance, which brings freedom and joy (1 John 1:9). God's forgiveness is immediate and complete when we confess, and His grace empowers change (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\nPractically, here's how to move forward:\n\n1. **Separate households lovingly**: Move to separate living spaces to honor God's boundaries. It might feel disruptive, but it's an act of obedience that rebuilds purity and trust.\n\n2. **Pursue purity together**: Set clear boundaries—no overnight stays, accountability with mentors. Flee temptation (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5), perhaps using resources like premarital books (*The Meaning of Marriage* by Tim Keller) or apps for purity accountability.\n\n3. **Consider marriage seriously**: If you're committed, prayerfully plan a wedding. Seek premarital counseling through our church to build a strong foundation—covering communication, finances, and faith.\n\n4. **Seek community support**: Join a small group or get a mentor couple. You're not alone; God equips us through His people (Hebrews 10:24-25).\n\nFriends, God's ways bring true flourishing, even if countercultural. Imagine the testimony of a marriage built on obedience! Let's pray right now: *Father, thank You for this couple's love and seeking heart. Forgive where we've strayed, empower purity, and guide their steps. If marriage is Your will, prepare them richly. In Jesus' name, Amen.*\n\nI'm here anytime—let's meet again soon. God bless you both abundantly.\n\nIn Christ's love,  \nPastor [Your Name]",

It maintains grace-focused pastoral care and encourages repentance without condemnation, aligning with historic orthodoxy. Subtle nuances are present, but the main framework is biblically sound. Minor caveat centers on the absolutist phrasing about cohabitation implying fornication, which could be nuanced to distinguish between cohabitation and sexual activity.)"
