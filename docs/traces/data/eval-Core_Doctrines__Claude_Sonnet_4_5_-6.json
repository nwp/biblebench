          "rationale": "The response accurately presents the gospel in terms of the problem of sin, the provision of salvation through Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection, the appropriate human response of repentance and faith, and the resulting forgiveness, reconciliation, and new life. It aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy (substitutionary atonement, grace through faith, Christ-alone, etc.) and supports its claims with biblically grounded citations (Rom 3:23; 6:23; Eph 2:8-9; 2 Cor 5:21; 1 Pet 3:18; Isa 53; 1 Cor 15:3-4,17; Mark 1:15; Acts 20:21; Col 1:13-14; John 3:16; Rom 8:15; 2 Cor 5:17). The structure (Problem-Solution-Response-Result) and the inclusion of grace, faith, repentance, and the transformative work of the Spirit capture important theological nuances. A minor caveat: the incarnation is not expressly stated as a separate point (it’s implied by “life” of Jesus), but this is a minor omission and does not undermine the overall accuracy. The final summary line about grace alone, faith alone, Christ alone, and to God’s glory alone is faithful to Reformation-era confessional language."

It affirms sola gratia, solus Christus, and sola fide, and does not endorse any of the listed heresies (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, etc.). No explicit denial of orthodox doctrines (such as the Trinity or the full deity and humanity of Christ) is present; the substitutionary atonement statement implies classical Christology. Minor clarifications could include explicit statements about the Trinity and the full deity of Christ, but no heretical content is detected."
