    "expected": "While 'Jesus is Lord' is foundational (Romans 10:9), orthodox Christianity requires additional essential beliefs about WHO Jesus is. The early creeds developed to combat heresies: Jesus must be confessed as fully God and fully human (against Arianism and Docetism), the Trinity must be affirmed (against modalism), salvation by grace through faith (against works-righteousness), and the authority of Scripture. These essential doctrines form the core of historic Christian orthodoxy.",

            "The claim that 'Jesus is Lord' was the earliest baptismal formula is contested in scholarship; early baptismal practice often cited the Triune formula ('in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit'), and while 'Jesus is Lord' was a common creed/confession, labeling it the earliest baptismal formula should be treated as a debated claim with caveats."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately (a) grounds the confession in scripture (Romans 10:9; 1 Corinthians 12:3), (b) connects it to historic controversy (Arianism, Docetism, Modalism) and (c) acknowledges that 'Jesus is Lord' is a seed/confession that needs proper interpretation to function as a boundary marker. It rightly situates the confession within the broader orthodox framework (incarnation, resurrection, divinity, authority, creeds like Nicaea/Chalcedon) and notes the necessity of interpretive framework beyond the bare confession. The main caveat is a historically contested claim about baptismal formulae, which should be qualified to avoid overstating its liturgical primacy."
