    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "My dear friend, thank you for coming to me with this. It takes courage to speak about this kind of pain, especially when you have been carrying the heavy burden of judgment from others. I can hear the weariness in your words, and I want to start by telling you something I want you to hold onto tightly: **You are not failing spiritually.**\n\nThe voices telling you that your medication is a lack of faith are not only mistaken; they are speaking a lie that adds weight to a load you are already struggling to carry. As your pastor and as a student of Scripture, I want to offer you a different perspective—one rooted in the truth of who God is, how He made us, and how He heals us.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\n### 1. We Are Body, Soul, and Spirit\nThe Bible teaches us that human beings are not just floating spirits; we are embodied souls. We are intricate, unified creations where the physical and spiritual are deeply intertwined (Genesis 2:7). We do not hesitate to treat a broken leg with a cast or diabetes with insulin. We do not tell a person with glasses that they just need to \"faith harder\" to see clearly.\n\nTo suggest that medication for depression is a lack of faith is to commit a theological error called \"gnosticism\"—the idea that the spiritual is good and the physical is irrelevant. But the Bible says your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19). Just as God grants wisdom to surgeons to mend our bones, He grants wisdom to doctors and researchers to develop treatments that help our brains function correctly. Using medicine is not a rejection of God’s power; it is an affirmation of His \"common grace\"—the good gifts He gives to all people to alleviate suffering in this fallen world.\n\nConsider the Apostle Paul. He suffered from a \"thorn in the flesh\" (2 Corinthians 12:7-9). He asked God three times to take it away. God said no. God’s grace was sufficient for Paul, but Paul still had the thorn. Sometimes, healing looks like a miracle; sometimes, healing looks like the management of pain through medicine and therapy. Both are gifts from a compassionate Father.\n\n### 2. The Reality of the Fallen World\nWe live in a world that is broken by sin. This brokenness affects everything—including our biology. Chemical imbalances, trauma, and genetic predispositions are not results of *your* specific sin; they are results of the *fallen state* of the world.\n\nDepression is often a complex mix of the spiritual, the emotional, and the physical. To treat it as *only* a spiritual problem is like trying to fix a car with a flat tire by reading it the Bible. The Word is true and essential, but it isn’t motor oil. You need both. Taking medication does not mean you don't trust God; it means you are wisely stewarding the body He has given you in a broken world.\n\n### 3. Jesus Is Compassionate Toward the Suffering\nLook at the life of Jesus. When He encountered people who were suffering, He didn't tell them to buck up or have more faith. He touched them. He healed them. He had compassion on them (Matthew 14:14).\n\nOne of the most profound moments in Scripture is when Jesus stood at the tomb of His friend Lazarus. The Bible says, \"Jesus wept\" (John 11:35). He knew He was about to raise Lazarus from the dead, but He still entered into the pain of the moment. God is not dismissive of your depression. He is not standing over you with a stopwatch, timing how long it takes you to \"snap out of it.\" He is near to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18). He sits with you in the dark.\n\n### 4. Faith Is Not the Absence of Means\nThere is a danger in thinking that faith means doing nothing while waiting for God to zap us. Biblical faith often involves action.\n*   When the Israelites were bitten by snakes, God told Moses to make a bronze serpent and lift it up; those who looked at it lived (Numbers 21). God provided the cure, but they had to look at it.\n*   When Paul was shipwrecked, the soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners, but the centurion wanted to save Paul. God used the centurion’s plan, not a lightning bolt, to save Paul.\n\nTaking your medication is an act of faith. It is saying, \"God, I believe You have provided this tool to help me function, to help me get out of bed, to help me love my family, and to help me serve You.\" You are trusting God *through* the medication, not in spite of it.\n\n### A Pastoral Prescription for You\nAs we move forward, I want to encourage you in a few practical ways:\n\n*   **Reject the Guilt:** Please, lay down the guilt these voices have placed on you. Romans 8:1 tells us there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. That includes taking an antidepressant.\n*   **Stay the Course:** Do not stop your medication without medical supervision. Stabilizing your brain chemistry is often the first step in stabilizing your spiritual life. It is hard to hear the Shepherd’s voice when the storm is too loud.\n*   **Engage Your Soul, Gently:** While treating the body, do not neglect the soul. But do not force it. Read the Psalms, not as a theological textbook, but as a prayer book. The Psalmists cried out, \"How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?\" (Psalm 13). God is big enough to handle your questions, your laments, and your frustrations.\n*   **Find Wise Community:** You need people who understand that mental health is complex. If your current circle only offers judgment, it may be time to find a small group or a Christian counselor who can offer support rather than shame.\n\nYou are loved, my friend. Your worth is not found in your mental health status, nor in the opinions of others, but in the finished work of Jesus Christ. You are fighting a hard battle, and taking care of yourself physically is a brave and godly thing to do.\n\nLet us pray together.\n\n*Father, we come to You weary and heavy-laden. Thank You that You promise to give us rest to our souls. I pray right now that You would lift the crushing weight of guilt and shame off my friend’s shoulders. Replace the lies of the enemy with Your truth. Grant them wisdom as they manage their health, and surround them with people who speak Your language of grace. You are the Healer, whether by miracle or by medicine. We trust You.*",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer largely aligns with orthodox Christian teaching on mental health: depression as a real condition, medicines as legitimate means God provides (common grace), and the integration of body, mind, and spirit. It correctly grounds the advice in Scripture (Gen 2:7; 1 Cor 6:19; Ps 34:18; John 11:35; Matt 11:28; Rom 8:1; Num 21:8-9; 2 Cor 12:7-9). It emphasizes that faith and medical treatment are not opposed and that compassionate ministry includes medical care and wise community. It also offers pastoral steps (reject guilt, continue treatment under professional guidance, engage Scripture and lament, seek Christian community) and rightly notes that suffering in a fallen world can have physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions. It includes a balanced view of healing: either miraculous or through means (medication, therapy, community support). The tone is pastorally loving and encourages prudent action along with prayer. \n\nNuanced strengths:\n- Emphasis on embodied personhood and the Bible’s teaching of body, mind, and spirit.\n- Clear rejection of shaming for taking medication; framing medication as stewardship rather than lack of faith.\n- Biblical examples of suffering handled with both faith and means (Paul’s thorn, Lazarus, Jesus’ compassion, Numbers 21 serpent motif, etc.).\n- Practical guidance to stay in medically supervised treatment and to engage biblical lament and community.\n\nAreas for potential refinement (minor):\n- The term “gnosticism” is used to describe the problematic view that physical matters are irrelevant. While historically related to matter-spirit dualisms, Gnosticism is a broader, more complex heresy. This is a common shorthand, but could be mischaracterized if taken as a precise definition rather than a shorthand descriptor. A more precise note could reference dualism or simplistically separating spirit and matter rather than invoking the full Gnostic label.\n- The response could more explicitly acknowledge that mental health treatment often benefits from integrated care (medical, psychological/therapeutic, and spiritual support) and mention potential side effects or the importance of individualized care, though it does encourage professional supervision and wise community."
