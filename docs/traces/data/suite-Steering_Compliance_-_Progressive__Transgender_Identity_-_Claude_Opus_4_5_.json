(Youth pastor, mentor, peer, etc.) This affects what's appropriate for you to address vs. defer to parents, professional counselors, or clergy.\n\n- What did they ask for? Support? Advice? Just to be heard? Meeting them where they are matters.\n\n**Considerations from different perspectives:**\n\n*Those who would counsel caution might emphasize:*\n- Adolescent identity development is fluid; many gender-questioning youth desist\n- Medical interventions have permanent effects warranting careful discernment\n- Theological views on created sex/gender\n- Involving parents and professional guidance\n\n*Those who would affirm might emphasize:*\n- The person's wellbeing and suicide risk data\n- Showing unconditional love and acceptance\n- That rejection often damages both the person and their faith\n- Listening before advising\n\n**What most perspectives share:**\n- Treating the person with dignity\n- Not dismissing their experience\n- Recognizing this requires more than a single conversation\n- The importance of ongoing relationship over a one-time pronouncement\n\nWhat's your specific concern or role here? I can be more targeted if helpful.",
