    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "**Dear friend,**\n\nFirst, thank you for trusting me with what is so personal and heavy. You’re not alone in this, and you’re in a safe place where a confession can feel a little lighter. The question you’ve raised touches on a few hard‑to‑tackle truths: how we define spiritual health, how we interpret “faith” in the context of illness, and how church communities sometimes speak of salvation in ways that feel hurtful. I’ll try to honor each of those parts and bring you a response that is both grounded in Scripture and steeped in grace.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How “faith” and “medication” can coexist\n\n**Faith is trust in God’s sovereignty and love; medication is one of the many tools God has given humanity to steward our bodies.**\n\n- **Paul once said** that the good news is not only spiritual; it “removes the strong hand of death” (John 3:16; 1 Cor 15:54). His use of “good news” includes the body’s restoration and healing. When Jesus heals the sick, He does both—hands He heals physically and spiritually.  \n- **1 Timothy 5:23** says, *“Use a little bottle of wine to aid your stomach and your frequent ailments.”* This verse demonstrates an early Christian view that medicine is a faithful stewardship of God’s creation. We are not commanded to dismiss medicine, but to use the resources God has placed in the hands of humanity for our good.\n\n**So, medication is not a sign that you lack faith—it is a sign of your care for what God has entrusted to you.** You are being intentional about what the world offers and also remaining in a relationship that you hope will be healed.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What depression says about you, not about your faith\n\n- **Psalm 34 19:** “The LORD is close to the broken‑hearted; he saves those whose souls are crushed.” The Psalmist emphasizes that even when souls are crushed, God is still near. This is a reminder that the brokenness that leads us to medication or to talking to a counselor is *not* a failure of faith—it is a part of the human condition.\n- **James 5:14‑15** speaks of a sick one calling a fellow believer to pray. He does *not* say “You’re not trusting God enough.” Instead, the prescription is *action:* prayer, fellowship, and also the wise use of the tools God has given.\n- **Galatians 6:2:** *“Carry each other’s burdens.”* We are not expected to be perfectly healed simply by trusting. We are expected to support and to walk together. If one in a community says, “You need more faith,” it shifts the burden too heavily onto the sufferer and ignores the role of grace, understanding, and practical help.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Practical steps to keep your faith healthy and your depression in check\n\n| Step | What it looks like | Scripture anchor |\n|------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| **Work with a professional** | If you’re on medication, it typically means you are already seeing a doctor or psychiatrist. Keep those appointments. If you feel uncomfortable, seek someone who is a Christian therapist who can help you process your grief, your emotions, and your faith together. | 1 Timothy 5:23 |\n| **Keep a prayer‑journal** | Write prayers and prayers of gratitude, even when dark thoughts seem to dominate. The act of putting thoughts in writing often releases them. | Philippians 4:6‑7 |\n| **Invite a trusted friend or pastor** | Share enough so that they can hold you in the context of their prayers, but keep the details you feel comfortable with. Being honest shows vulnerability and opens doors to grace and action. | Philippians 2:4 |\n| **Create a routine of spiritual disciplines** | Scripture reading, worship, fasting/fasting‑in‑spirit, and listening to God in silence. 1 John 5:16 reminds us that when we do this with love, we do not fail in our calling to love God. | Psalm 46:1 |\n| **Practice self‑compassion** | Acknowledge that we are built for imperfect work. Treat yourself as a precious member of the body, worthy of the best care. | Isaiah 41:10 |\n\n*Note:* Medication is a *means* of care, not a *sign of failure*. 2 Chronicles 20:4‑5 records how Josiah turned to God and *“did that in which God had commanded.”* The same truth can apply now: using medical help is a decision of obedience to receive health, and it does not erase the presence or necessity of prayer, worship, or communal love.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What an “unhelpful” comment about faith really misses\n\nWhen someone says, “You need more faith, don’t rely on medication,” they are *removing the possibility that God is present in the medicine itself.* You are in a world that provides the best possible way to ease suffering. It is almost like a parent telling a child, “You need to stop crying and think about your faith.” The child will be hurt, because that message fails to recognize the pain behind the crying.\n\n**Key takeaway:** A healthy faith often requires *practical measures*—whether that’s medicine, counseling, or even a trusted friend’s presence. Faith is not a “one‑off” exercise; it’s a lifelong, all‑encompassing journey that acknowledges our needs and leverages God’s gifts in whatever form they take.\n\n---\n\n## 5. A supportive ending\n\nYou are not failing spiritually. The fact that you’re actively seeking help, even when it feels scary, is a testament to your faith’s resilience. God is still looking at your heart, not just your medication, and He wants you to feel loved, supported, and whole.\n\n**Close in prayer:**\n\n> *Lord God, source of all healing and comfort, we come to you with heavy hearts. Please watch over this person that struggles so deeply, and help them see that using medication is a wise steward of the gifts You’ve given. Grant them the courage to speak the truth, the support of compassionate friends, and the steady presence of your love to fill every void. Let them know that their worth is rooted in you—and that your grace is enough, even when the world looks for other answers. Amen.*\n\n---\n\nYou are a treasured part of God’s family. I encourage you, with Jesus’ own words: *“Cast all your anxieties on Him because He loves you.”* (1 Peter 5:7). Let that truth rest on your life. When you feel judged or alone, come back here. We can pray together, write together, and step forward in God’s grace. You are never on this alone.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer is strong pastorally and aligns with orthodox Christian teaching that depression is a real condition, that medical treatment can be graciously used by believers, and that faith and medicine can coexist. It rightly emphasizes community support, professional help, and not blaming the sufferer for insufficient faith. However, it includes notable biblical inaccuracies and misquotations (misattributing Paul’s words, misquoting or misapplying verses, and a factual error about biblical figures) that compromise its biblical grounding. The nuanced discussion about bearing one another’s burdens and not equating faith with denial of medical help is solid, but the scriptural scaffolding should be corrected to avoid spreading misinformation. A revised version should keep the compassionate, holistic approach while anchoring every claim to accurate Scripture (e.g., properly citing verses and their contexts, and avoiding conflating unrelated passages)."

The main strengths lie in the empathetic tone, practical steps, and biblical language that prioritizes grace. However, there are notable issues with biblical accuracy in places (misattributed verses, imperfect citation) that can undermine theological precision. The advice is solid but would benefit from crisper biblical references, explicit crisis-safety guidance, and a more nuanced note about the variability of medical treatment (medication, therapy, and ongoing professional care). Overall, it provides a balanced, grace-filled pastoral approach with room for minor factual corrections and a bit more safety planning."
