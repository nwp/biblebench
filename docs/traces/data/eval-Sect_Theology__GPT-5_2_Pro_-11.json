    "expected": "No, this is the ancient heresy of modalism (also called Sabellianism), which was condemned by the early church. Orthodox Christianity teaches that God is one being eternally existing as three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Biblical evidence for their simultaneous distinct existence includes Jesus' baptism (Matthew 3:16-17) where the Son is baptized, the Spirit descends, and the Father speaks - all at the same time. Jesus prays to the Father (John 17), showing personal relationship between persons. The apostolic blessing (2 Corinthians 13:14) distinguishes three persons. Modalism was rejected because it cannot account for the relationships within the Godhead and makes Jesus' prayers to the Father nonsensical.",
    "output": "In historic, “orthodox” Christianity (i.e., the faith expressed in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed and received across Catholic, Orthodox, and most Protestant churches), God is **one** divine being/essence who exists eternally as **three distinct persons**: **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit**. This is the doctrine of the **Trinity**.\n\n### What Oneness Pentecostalism is teaching (as described)\nThe view you summarized—**one divine person** who appears or operates in three “modes,” “roles,” or “manifestations” (Father/Son/Spirit)—is a classic form of what the early church called **modalism** (often associated with “Sabellianism”).\n\n- It preserves **monotheism** strongly.\n- It typically affirms the full **deity of Christ** and takes biblical language about God’s oneness very seriously.\n\n### Where it agrees with orthodox Christianity\nOneness Pentecostalism often shares important convictions with Nicene Christianity, such as:\n\n- **There is one God** (not three gods).\n- Jesus is not a mere creature; his identity is bound up with the one true God.\n- Scripture is authoritative, and God truly reveals himself as Father, Son, and Spirit.\n\nSo the disagreement is not mainly “Is God one?” but **what kind of oneness God has** and how Father/Son/Spirit are related.\n\n### Where it departs from orthodox (Nicene) Christianity\nOrthodox Christianity rejects modalism because it denies the **real, eternal personal distinctions** between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\n1. **Trinitarian doctrine says the distinctions are eternal and simultaneous**\n   - The Father is not the Son; the Son is not the Spirit.\n   - God does not merely “switch roles” or appear under different masks.\n   - The persons relate to one another (the Father *sends* the Son; the Son *prays* to the Father; the Father and Son *send* the Spirit).\n\n2. **Modalism struggles to account for biblical scenes where Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct at the same time**\n   A key example is Jesus’ baptism (e.g., Matthew 3:16–17):  \n   - the Son is baptized,  \n   - the Spirit descends,  \n   - the Father speaks from heaven.  \n   Trinitarians understand this as revealing real personal distinctions, not merely one person acting in three ways.\n\n3. **It typically involves denying or redefining “eternal Sonship”**\n   Many Oneness teachers say “Son” refers primarily to God’s incarnation (God as man), not an eternal divine person. Nicene theology, however, confesses the Son as “begotten of the Father before all ages”—i.e., the Son is eternally the Son, not “Son” only after the incarnation.\n\n### Historical judgment of the church\nModalism was explicitly rejected by the early church and is incompatible with the ecumenical creeds most Christians use as markers of orthodoxy (e.g., the Nicene Creed; also the Athanasian Creed’s insistence that we worship “one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity… neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance”).\n\n### So is it orthodox?\n**By the standard meaning of “orthodox” in historic Christianity (Nicene/creedal orthodoxy), the Oneness view described is not orthodox.** It is generally classified as a **non-Trinitarian** theology, similar in type (though not identical in every detail) to ancient modalism.\n\nThat said, discussions with Oneness Pentecostals can still be respectful and substantive because they often intend to honor biblical monotheism and the deity of Christ; the key issue is whether Father, Son, and Spirit are merely different modes of one person or **distinct persons in the one God**.",

          "rationale": "The LLM accurately presents orthodox Trinitarian theology (one being/essence, eternally existing as three distinct persons: Father, Son, Spirit) and correctly identifies Oneness Pentecostalism as modalism. It provides biblical support points (Jesus' baptism in Matthew 3:16-17; Jesus praying in John 17; the Pauline blessing in 2 Corinthians 13:14) to illustrate real personal distinctions in the Godhead, and it explains why modalism struggles to account for these simultaneous personal distinctions. It also notes the eternal, not merely functional, relations (Father/Son/Spirit) and the traditional rejection of modalism by the church (creeds). The response is balanced, acknowledging common ground with Oneness beliefs (monotheism, deity of Christ) while maintaining clear doctrinal boundaries. Minor enhancements could include citing additional creedal language (e.g., Athanasian Creed) or addressing potential nuances within some Oneness teachings, but overall it is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."
