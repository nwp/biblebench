It uses cautious, non-dogmatic language (e.g., “emphasizes,” “acknowledges legitimate diversity,” “secondary issue with room for disagreement”) and includes both traditional and progressive elements within its framework. This indicates a preference for doctrinal nuance and contextual interpretation over a fixed, exclusive stance, aligning with a moderate orientation rather than clearly progressive or conservative.",
