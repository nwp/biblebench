    "input": "Someone says they believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as taught in the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price alongside the Bible. How does this differ from historic Christian teaching?",
    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "In analyzing the theology of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) regarding the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as found in their expanded canon, it is helpful to look at three primary areas: the nature of God, the relationship between the persons (Social Trinitarianism vs. Ontological Trinitarianism), and the doctrine of exaltation.\n\nWhile LDS members use the same biblical terminology as historic Christians, the underlying definitions represent a significant departure from the Creeds (Apostle’s, Nicene, and Athanasian) that define orthodox Christian theology.\n\n### 1. The Nature of the Persons (Embodiment)\nThe most immediate departure from historic Christian theology concerns the physical nature of God.\n\n*   **Historic Christian Teaching:** God is spirit (John 4:24), incorporeal, and without parts. Orthodoxy teaches that the Son took on flesh at the Incarnation, but the Father and the Holy Spirit remain purely spiritual beings.\n*   **LDS Teaching:** Based on *Doctrine and Covenants 130:22*, Latter-day Saints believe that \"The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit.\" \n\nIn historic Christianity, the \"impassibility\" and \"immateriality\" of God the Father are central. The LDS view that the Father is a physical, resurrected being is a fundamental shift in ontology (the nature of being).\n\n### 2. The Relationship of the Godhead (The \"Trinity\" vs. \"Godhead\")\nBoth traditions believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. However, they define their \"oneness\" differently.\n\n*   **Historic Christian Teaching (Monotheism/Trinitarianism):** Orthodoxy teaches **one God in three Persons.** These three persons share the same *ousia* (substance or essence). There is only one Being who is God. To suggest they are three separate beings would be considered \"Tritheism.\"\n*   **LDS Teaching (Social Trinitarianism):** The LDS scriptures and teachings describe the Godhead as three distinct beings who are \"one\" in purpose, heart, mind, and glory, but not in substance. While the *Book of Mormon* contains passages that sound strongly Trinitarian (e.g., Mosiah 15, Mormon 7:27), later revelations in the *Doctrine and Covenants* emphasize their distinctness as separate personages.\n\nFor the historic Christian, God is one *Being*. For the Latter-day Saint, God is one *Council* or *Unity* of three separate Beings.\n\n### 3. Eternal Progression and Exaltation\nThe origins and future of the Father and humanity also differ significantly between the two traditions.\n\n*   **Historic Christian Teaching:** God is the \"unmoved mover,\" the \"uncreated Creator.\" He has always been God from all eternity. There is a categorical divide between Creator and creature that can never be crossed. \n*   **LDS Teaching:** Building on the *King Follett Discourse* and the *Pearl of Great Price* (Book of Abraham), LDS theology suggests that God the Father was once a mortal man who lived on an earth and progressed to his current state of exaltation. Consequently, LDS doctrine teaches that humans are the literal \"spirit offspring\" of Heavenly Parents and have the potential to become like God (exaltation), a concept summarized by Lorenzo Snow: \"As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be.\"\n\nWhile historic Christianity has a concept called *theosis* (deification), particularly in Eastern Orthodoxy, it strictly maintains that humans become \"partakers of the divine nature\" through grace but never become \"gods\" in their own right or equal to the Father in essence.\n\n### 4. Christology (The Origin of the Son)\n*   **Historic Christian Teaching:** Jesus Christ is the \"eternally begotten\" Son of God. There was never a time when He was not. He is uncreated and co-eternal with the Father.\n*   **LDS Teaching:** Jesus is the firstborn of the Father’s spirit children. While He is considered divine and the Creator of the world under the Father's direction, LDS theology posits that His \"spirit\" had a beginning in time as the offspring of God.\n\n### Areas of Agreement\nDespite these significant departures, there are areas of shared conviction:\n1.  **Divinity:** Both believe that many of the attributes of the Godhead—love, justice, mercy, and power—are shared by all three members.\n2.  **Soteriology (Salvation):** Both agree that the Son (Jesus Christ) is the only way to salvation, that He was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, died on the cross for the sins of the world, and was physically resurrected.\n3.  **Biblical Language:** Both use the Bible as a foundational text and agree on the titles and roles described therein (Advocate, Comforter, Creator).\n\n### Summary\nThe LDS view is a departure from historic Christian theology primarily because it rejects the post-apostolic creeds. It replaces **Ontological Monotheism** (one divine substance) with a form of **Divine Pluralism** or **Social Monotheism** (three distinct beings in a unified council). To an orthodox theologian, the LDS view is a movement away from the \"incomprehensible and spirit-only\" God of the creeds toward a \"material and anthropomorphic\" view of divinity.",

          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately outlines core LDS differences from historic Christianity: (1) embodiment of the Father and Son vs the orthodox view of God as Spirit with the Father and Spirit impassible; (2) the Godhead as three distinct beings united in purpose rather than one essence; (3) doctrines of eternal progression/exaltation and premortal existence of Jesus; (4) Christology differences regarding the eternal generation vs premortal existence of Jesus. It also notes concordances (divinity of Jesus, centrality of Christ for salvation) and engages with nuanced contrasts between ontological (substance) unity and economic/unity-in-purpose language. It explicitly cites LDS sources (D&C 130:22, King Follett discourse, Pearl of Great Price) and biblical passages (John 4:24; Mosiah 15; Mormon 7:27) to ground claims. However, it could more explicitly address: (a) the canonical status issue (sola scriptura vs additional LDS scriptures) in relation to historic canon, (b) the potential risk of readers interpreting 'three separate beings' as Tritheism without emphasizing the LDS claim of unity in purpose, and (c) more canonical biblical evidence from early creedal orthodoxy (e.g., Matthew 28:19, John 1:1-14) to contrast with LDS teaching.
