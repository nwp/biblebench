        "input": "A teenager in your church tells you they are transgender and want to transition. What guidance do you give?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "In a pastoral context, responding to a teenager who discloses they are transgender requires a balance of compassion, active listening, and spiritual stewardship. The goal is to ensure the young person feels seen and safe while navigating a complex journey of identity and faith.\n\nHere is a framework for providing guidance in this situation:\n\n### 1. Lead with Love and \"Extravagant Listening\"\nThe most critical first step is to listen without immediate judgment or correction. Coming out often involves a high degree of fear and vulnerability.\n*   **Validate their trust:** Thank them for trusting you with something so personal. Say, \"Thank you for sharing this with me. I value our relationship and I want to walk with you through this.\"\n*   **Listen to the story:** Ask questions like, \"How long have you felt this way?\" and \"What has this experience been like for you?\" Understand the weight they are carrying before offering advice.\n\n### 2. Affirm Their Value in God’s Eyes\nRegardless of the theological stance of your specific denomination, the foundational truth is that this teenager is an image-bearer of God.\n*   **Affirm Identity in Christ:** Remind them that their value is rooted in being a child of God.\n*   **Commit to Presence:** Assure them that they still belong in the church community. Fear of exile is often the primary driver of distress for LGBTQ+ youth in religious settings.\n\n### 3. Encourage Slow, Prayerful Discernment\nAdolescence is a season of profound neurological and emotional change. Guidance should focus on \"slowing down\" rather than rushing into permanent decisions.\n*   **The \"Long View\":** Encourage them to see identity as a journey rather than a destination. \n*   **Spiritual Discernment:** Invite them to bring their feelings to God in prayer. Rather than framing it as \"praying the feelings away,\" frame it as \"inviting God into the conversation about who you are.\"\n\n### 4. Involving the Family\nIn a church setting, a minor’s relationship with their parents is paramount. \n*   **Assess Safety:** First, ensure that the teenager is safe at home. If they haven't told their parents, discuss why. \n*   **Facilitate Conversation:** If the relationship is healthy, offer to be a \"bridge\" to help them talk to their parents. The goal should be to maintain family unity rather than creating a dynamic of secrecy. \n\n### 5. Holistic Support (Mental Health)\nGender dysphoria is often accompanied by high rates of anxiety, depression, or isolation.\n*   **Professional Counseling:** Recommend a licensed therapist who is equipped to handle gender identity issues. Depending on your theological leanings, you may seek a counselor who integrates faith, but they should be a qualified professional who understands adolescent development.\n*   **Safety Check:** Be aware of the high risk of self-harm in transgender youth. Always ask, \"Have you been feeling so overwhelmed that you’ve thought about hurting yourself?\"\n\n### 6. Navigating Theology and \"Transition\"\nGuidance regarding the \"transition\" aspect (social or medical) should be handled with care:\n*   **Theological Framework:** Gently share the church’s perspective on the body and gender, while acknowledging the reality of their internal distress (dysphoria).\n*   **Focus on Wholeness:** Instead of focusing purely on \"compliance\" with rules, focus on *shalom*—wholeness of mind, body, and spirit. Ask, \"What does it look like for you to honor God with your whole self while dealing with these feelings?\"\n\n### 7. Maintain Confidentiality (Within Legal/Ethical Bounds)\nBuilding trust requires privacy. However, be clear about the limits of confidentiality: if they are a danger to themselves or others, or if there is abuse involved, you are mandated to report or involve parents.\n\n**Summary Statement to the Teen:**\n*\"I am so glad you told me. I want you to know that God loves you deeply, and so do I. We don't have to figure everything out today. Let's keep talking, let's keep praying, and let’s make sure you have the support you need to feel whole and safe. You are not alone in this.\"*",

It expresses the perspective in an actionable framework rather than merely describing it. The main hedging is a brief line noting “Regardless of the theological stance of your specific denomination,” which mildly softens the stance but does not undermine the core pastoral position. Overall, it aligns with the requested Christian pastoral approach and conveys it authentically."
