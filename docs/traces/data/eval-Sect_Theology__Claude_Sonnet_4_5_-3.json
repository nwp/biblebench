    "expected": "LDS theology teaches that Jesus and Lucifer (Satan) are spirit brothers, both created by God the Father in a pre-mortal existence. This is incompatible with orthodox Christianity for several reasons: (1) Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17 says all things were created through him); (2) Jesus is worshiped as God (Hebrews 1:6) while Satan is a fallen angel; (3) This teaching diminishes Christ's unique divine nature and blurs the absolute distinction between the Creator and creation. Orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus as the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity, while Satan is a created angelic being who rebelled.",
    "output": "# LDS Teaching on Jesus and Lucifer\n\n## The LDS Position\n\nLatter-day Saints teach that Jesus Christ and Lucifer (Satan) are both spirit children of Heavenly Father, created in a pre-mortal existence. In LDS theology:\n\n- All humans and angels, including Jesus and Lucifer, are literally begotten spirit offspring of God the Father\n- In a pre-mortal council, both Jesus and Lucifer presented plans for human salvation\n- Jesus's plan was accepted; Lucifer rebelled and became Satan\n- They are therefore spirit brothers, though now on opposite sides\n\nThis is taught in LDS scripture (Pearl of Great Price, Moses 4:1-4) and official church materials.\n\n## Orthodox Christian Position\n\nOrthodox Christianity across Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant traditions teaches fundamentally different doctrines:\n\n### 1. **The Nature of Christ**\n- Jesus is the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity\n- He is \"begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father\" (Nicene Creed)\n- He has always existed; He was not created at any point\n\n### 2. **The Nature of Angels/Satan**\n- Lucifer/Satan is a created being, an angel who fell through pride\n- All angels are created beings with a definite beginning\n- There is an absolute ontological distinction between Creator and creation\n\n### 3. **The Key Difference**\n- **Jesus = uncreated God**, Creator of all things (John 1:3, Colossians 1:16)\n- **Lucifer = created being**, made by God\n\n## Why This Is Problematic from an Orthodox Perspective\n\n### **Diminishes Christ's Divinity**\nThe LDS view places Jesus in the category of created beings rather than identifying Him as the eternal Creator. This contradicts:\n- John 1:1-3: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\"\n- Colossians 1:16-17: \"For by him all things were created... all things were created through him and for him\"\n\n### **Contradicts the Doctrine of the Trinity**\nOrthodox Christianity affirms that God has eternally existed as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—three persons, one essence, uncreated and co-equal.\n\n### **Alters the Gospel Message**\nIf Jesus is merely an exalted created being rather than God Himself, it fundamentally changes:\n- Who is providing salvation (a fellow creature vs. God Himself)\n- The efficacy of the atonement (can a created being's sacrifice atone for all humanity?)\n- The nature of worship (only God is to be worshiped)\n\n## Biblical Passages Relevant to Orthodox View\n\n- **Hebrews 1:3-6**: Distinguishes Jesus as superior to angels, God's Son to whom angels worship\n- **Philippians 2:5-11**: Christ existed \"in the form of God\" before taking human form\n- **Colossians 2:9**: \"In him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily\"\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe difference represents a fundamental divide on the nature of God and Christ. Orthodox Christianity maintains an absolute Creator-creature distinction, with Jesus on the Creator side of that divide. The LDS teaching places Jesus on the creature side (albeit highly exalted), which orthodox Christians view as incompatible with biblical teaching and the historic Christian faith defined in the early ecumenical creeds.\n\nThis assessment is not meant disrespectfully toward Latter-day Saints, but rather to honestly articulate why mainstream Christianity sees this as a departure from essential Christian orthodoxy regarding the identity and nature of Jesus Christ.",

            "The claim 'All humans and angels, including Jesus and Lucifer, are literally begotten spirit offspring of God the Father' is a simplification that can mislead about LDS anthropology: in LDS teaching, humans and angels are spirit children of God, but Jesus is typically described as the 'Only Begotten Son' (in the sense of unique divine generation), while Lucifer is a non-divine spirit child. The wording risks conflating Jesus with created angels and obscures the unique eternal status of the Son as distinct from the general 'spirit children' category.",
            "The assertion 'In a pre-mortal council, both Jesus and Lucifer presented plans for human salvation' is a common summary in popular LDS teaching, but it is not unequivocally explicit in canonical sources. LDS material often emphasizes a pre-mortal council and a plan of salvation, but the exact portrayal (names, order, and emphasis) varies across sources. This framing may overstate specific scriptural wording that is not found in standard biblical texts and is debated among scholars and church members."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response does an effective job presenting the orthodox Christian critique (Jesus as eternal Son and Creator, the Creator/creature distinction, and the Trinity) and contrasts it with the LDS view. It cites biblical passages to support orthodox claims and maintains nuance in distinguishing positions. However, it introduces a somewhat oversimplified or potentially misleading summary of LDS anthropology and premortal events (calling Jesus and Lucifer ‘literally begotten’ and asserting they both presented salvation plans in a premortal council as explicit statements from canonical sources). Those points are better framed as commonly taught LDS beliefs supported by non-biblical sources, with more precise caution about canonical wording. The overall assessment remains doctrinally sound and nuanced, but the biblical grounding is weaker for the LDS specifics.}"
