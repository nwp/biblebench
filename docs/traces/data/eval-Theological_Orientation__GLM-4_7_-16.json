    "input": "What does the Bible teach about social justice, systemic racism, and economic inequality? Are these gospel issues or distractions from evangelism?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of whether social justice, systemic racism, and economic inequality are \"gospel issues\" or \"distractions\" is currently one of the most contentious debates within the global church. To answer this as a theologian, we must look past modern political labels and examine the biblical narrative, the mission of Jesus, and the history of Christian interpretation.\n\nThe short answer is that care for the vulnerable, pursuit of equity, and the dismantling of ethnic division are not secondary to the gospel; they are intrinsic to the *outworking* of the gospel. However, how we prioritize them in relation to verbal evangelism requires wisdom and biblical balance.\n\nHere is a theological breakdown of these issues.\n\n### 1. The Biblical Foundation for Justice and Equity\n\nIn the Old Testament, the words for justice (*mishpat*) and righteousness (*tzedakah*) are frequently paired. *Mishpat* refers to the judicial rendering of what is right (punishing crime), while *tzedakah* refers to right relationship and active generosity toward those in need.\n\n*   **Systemic Inequality:** The Law given to Israel was explicitly designed to prevent the permanent accumulation of wealth and power by a few. The **Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25)** was a systemic reset to prevent multigenerational poverty and ensure that every family had a stake in the community. The prophets consistently railed against the *system*—courts that favored the rich and landlords who exploited the poor (Isaiah 10:1-2, Amos 5:11-12). This suggests that God is concerned not just with individual charity, but with societal structures that oppress the poor.\n*   **The Nature of True Religion:** According to the prophet Isaiah, the fast God chooses is \"to loose the chains of injustice... to set the oppressed free and to break every yoke\" (Isaiah 58:6). Similarly, Micah 6:8 summarizes God’s requirement for his people: \"To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.\"\n\n### 2. Jesus and the Kingdom: A Holistic Gospel\n\nWhen Jesus began his ministry, he defined his mission by reading from Isaiah in the synagogue: \"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free\" (Luke 4:18).\n\n*   **Economic Inequality:** Jesus spoke more about money and possessions than heaven and hell combined. His encounter with the Rich Young Ruler (Mark 10) highlighted the spiritual danger of wealth accumulation in the face of poverty. The early church in Acts practiced a radical form of voluntary economic sharing that ensured \"there were no needy persons among them\" (Acts 4:34).\n*   **Systemic Racism (Ethnic Division):** In the first century, the divide between Jews and Samaritans (and Gentiles) was deep, systemic, and hostile. Jesus confronted this by making a Samaritan the hero of his parable on neighborliness (Luke 10) and by initiating the \"woman at the well\" conversation across racial lines (John 4).\n\n### 3. The New Testament Church and Structural Sin\n\nThe Apostle Paul provides the strongest theological argument for social justice as a gospel issue. In **Ephesians 2:14-16**, Paul states that Christ \"has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility.\" The Gospel is not just about saving souls for heaven; it is about creating a new humanity where ethnic and social divisions are crucified.\n\nFurthermore, **James 2** offers a stinging rebuke to the church. James argues that if you show favoritism to the rich while ignoring the poor, you are not just failing in manners; you are committing sin and \"are convicted by the law as transgressors.\"\n\n### 4. Are They \"Gospel Issues\" or Distractions?\n\nThis is the crux of the modern debate. To answer this, we must define the Gospel properly.\n\n**The View that they are Distractions:**\nSome Christians argue that the church’s primary job is the Great Commission (evangelism and discipleship). They fear that focusing on \"social justice\" leads to \"the Social Gospel,\" a movement in the early 20th century that focused so much on fixing society that it lost the emphasis on personal sin and the need for salvation through Christ. From this perspective, if the church becomes a political action committee, it loses its distinct spiritual power.\n\n**The View that they are Gospel Issues:**\nThe prevailing view in Scripture, however, suggests a \"Both/And\" rather than an \"Either/Or.\"\n\n*   **They are not the *whole* Gospel:** You cannot feed the poor and leave them under the wrath of God. Preaching the atoning work of Jesus is central.\n*   **They are *implications* of the Gospel:** You cannot preach a Gospel that saves sinners without instructing those sinners to love their neighbor. If the Gospel changes a person, it changes how they treat the poor, how they view race, and how they use their money.\n\nThe theologian Tim Keller often argued that **justice is the inevitable fruit of the gospel, not a substitute for it.** If we claim the gospel but do not care about the poor and the oppressed, our faith is \"dead\" (James 2:26). Conversely, if we do social justice without the gospel, we are merely offering temporary relief in a world headed for judgment.\n\n### 5. Systemic Racism: A Theological Category\n\nDoes the Bible support the concept of \"systemic\" or \"structural\" sin? Yes. Sin is not merely an individual act; it is a power that dwells in institutions and cultures (Romans 8:20-22 mentions creation being subjected to frustration). The biblical concept of the \"principalities and powers\" (Ephesians 6:12) suggests that spiritual forces often align with human systems to perpetuate evil.\n\nTherefore, recognizing systemic racism is not a rejection of individual responsibility; it is a recognition that sin is deeper than just personal choices. It acknowledges that society can be structured in a way that favors one group over another, requiring a prophetic witness to dismantle those unjust structures.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAre social justice, racial reconciliation, and care for the poor distractions from evangelism? **No.** They are the necessary evidence of a genuine evangelism.\n\n*   **Evangelism without social action** is incomplete; it preaches a truncated gospel that ignores the physical needs of the person made in God's image.\n*   **Social action without evangelism** is insufficient; it treats the symptoms of the human condition without curing the spiritual disease.\n\nA balanced theology holds that the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation (Romans 1:16), and that this salvation produces people who hunger and thirst for righteousness (Matthew 5:6). To pursue justice is not to abandon the gospel; it is to demonstrate the width and depth of the Kingdom that Jesus proclaimed.",

However, it also acknowledges legitimate disagreement by explicitly presenting an opposing view (that the church should prioritize the Great Commission and avoid social justice as a distraction) and by labeling the debate as a central issue. It assesses both sides—“Distractions” vs. “Gospel Issues”—and explains why the alternative view persists, while ultimately arguing for the necessity of justice as evidence of genuine evangelism. The tone is confident and justificatory but remains measured and aims for balance, indicating humility about nuances (e.g., “not the whole Gospel,” and the need for wisdom and balance)."
