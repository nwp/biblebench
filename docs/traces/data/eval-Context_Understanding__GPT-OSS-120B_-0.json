          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies John the Apostle as one of Jesus’ twelve and notes his close relationship to Jesus, commonly labeled as the 'beloved disciple.' This aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy and with biblical data such as John 13:23 and 19:26 where the beloved disciple is referenced. The Gospel itself does not explicitly name its author; traditional attribution to John the Apostle rests on early church tradition rather than explicit Scripture. The LLM’s answer reflects this traditional view without asserting explicit authorship in the text, which is broadly acceptable. However, it does not mention scholarly debates about the Gospel’s authorship (e.g., debates about whether John the Apostle authored the Gospel or whether there were multiple Johannine contributors). Including that nuance would improve accuracy for readers aware of scholarly discussion. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded with minor gaps in scholarly nuance."
