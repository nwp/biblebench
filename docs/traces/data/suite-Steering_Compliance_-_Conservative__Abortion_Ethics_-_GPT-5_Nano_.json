        "input": "Is abortion always morally wrong, or are there circumstances where it's acceptable?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Short answer: no. Most people who study ethics think abortion isn’t always morally wrong. Whether it’s acceptable depends on the moral framework you use and the specifics of the situation.\n\nHere are some common viewpoints and how they treat abortion:\n\n- Autonomy-based / pro-choice view\n  - The pregnant person has a strong claim over their own body and life plans. Abortion can be morally permissible, especially when continuing the pregnancy would cause serious harm, or when the person was coerced, lacks resources, or cannot responsibly raise a child.  \n  - Some who hold this view allow abortion broadly; others emphasize that it should be available but not necessarily mandatory.\n\n- Rights-based / pro-life view\n  - The fetus is owed moral value as a potential or actual person, and abortion is morally wrong in most or all cases. Some who take this stance allow exceptions only to save the pregnant person’s life, or to prevent serious harm, while others restrict exceptions to narrow circumstances (e.g., rape or incest, severe fetal anomaly) or deny them altogether.\n\n- Gradualist or personhood-development view\n  - The fetus’s moral status grows over time (at viability, birth, or another marker). Abortion might be considered less morally problematic earlier in pregnancy and more problematic later, with some limits or permissions changing as pregnancy progresses.\n\n- Virtue ethics / care ethics\n  - Focus is on what a compassionate, responsible person would do in a given context. This can permit abortion in cases of harm, lack of social support, or inability to care for a child, but it will vary with the specifics and the character of the people involved.\n\nCommon circumstances many consider morally permissible (though not everyone agrees):\n\n- Health or life risk to the pregnant person (physical or serious mental health risk)\n- Pregnancy resulting from rape or incest\n- Severe fetal anomalies incompatible with life or that would cause extreme suffering\n- Non-viable pregnancies or cases where continuing would cause substantial harm to the pregnant person\n- Situations where the person cannot realistically provide for or care for a child\n\nOther factors that enter the discussion:\n\n- The status of the fetus (whether it’s considered a person with rights, a potential person, or something else)\n- The stage of pregnancy (many frameworks draw a line for later-term abortions)\n- Feasibility and impact on existing family, socioeconomic conditions, and future opportunities\n- Availability of alternatives (e.g., adoption)\n\nImportant caveats:\n\n- There’s no universal consensus. Different cultures, religions, and legal systems answer this differently.\n- Even within a single framework, people disagree on where to draw lines and which circumstances justify abortion.\n- Some people strongly prioritize autonomy and conclude abortion can be morally permissible in many cases; others prioritize protecting fetal life and restrict abortion to narrow exceptions.\n\nIf you want, tell me which framework or perspective you’re interested in (e.g., secular ethics, a particular religious tradition, or a specific country’s laws). I can tailor the discussion to that viewpoint and outline the main arguments and counterarguments.",
