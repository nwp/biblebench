    "output": "**Traditional/majority view**\n\nThe Gospel of John is traditionally attributed to **John the Apostle** – the son of Zebedee, brother of James, and a co‑founder of the early Church in Jerusalem.  In the Greek text John uses a designation that has been interpreted as “apostle” (ἀποστόλος), a term the New Testament uses only for the Twelve.  Early Church fathers (e.g., Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and later Eusebius) consistently identified the author as John the son of Zebedee.  \nWithin the narrative itself, the “beloved disciple” is described as an eyewitness to key moments in Jesus’ ministry (John 1:35‑38; 1:45‑51), a person who was present at the crucifixion and claimed at the resurrection (John 20:2). Scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries have argued that this individual was the same John who first appears in the Synoptic Gospels among the fishermen.  Roman Catholic tradition currently holds that the apostle wrote the text, while the Greek designation “apostle” is seen as evidence of his membership among the early disciples.\n\n**Relationship to Jesus**\n\n- **Close follower** – John was one of the Inner Circle of disciples who sat beside Jesus at his burial, stood at the foot of the cross (John 20:2–3), and later witnessed the empty tomb and the appearances of the risen Christ (John 20‑24).  \n- **Eyewitness to the ministry** – He identifies Jesus as “the true Light” (John 1:4) and records many of the miracles and teachings in which he was present or who were received from him.  \n- **Recipient of an experiential bond** – The Gospel uses the phrase “the disciple who loved the Lord” (John 21:24) and repeatedly stresses John’s love for Jesus as the text’s central theme.  \n- **One of the “three whom Jesus loved”** – According to John 17:1‑21, these three were close companions, and many scholars interpret the “beloved disciple” as John.\n\n**Scholarly debate and alternative perspectives**\n\n1. **Johannine community hypothesis** – Many modern scholars argue that the Gospel was written by a **Johannine community** (early first‑century group centered in Ephesus or Jerusalem) rather than a single individual.  They propose that an unknown author, possibly a *John the Elder* or *John the Prophet*, wrote the text with the community’s theological orientation incorporated.\n\n2. **Anonymous author hypothesis** – Some propose that the gospel was produced by a **single, unnamed author** in the late first century, whose name was omitted or replaced by the later Christian tradition for patristic reasons.  Medieval attributions tended to solidify the apostolic link regardless of actual authorship.\n\n3. **Post‑apostle or later Johannine author** – Others suggest that a later follower of the apostle John (perhaps his son, also named John, or a disciple of the “beloved disciple”) could have composed the Gospel, using the apostle’s testimony as a source point.\n\n**Key evidentiary points**\n\n- **Internal evidence**: The Gospel references “the apostle” in several circumstantial contexts, such as the calling of disciples (John 1:69‑71), the selection of the twelve (John 3:1–2), and the mention that Jesus had spoken to “the apostles” (John 17:1; 4:19).  \n- **External evidence**: Patristic citations from the 2nd–5th centuries consistently see John the Apostle as the author, forming the traditional stance in Catholic and Orthodox liturgy.  \n- **Linguistic evidence**: The Greek term *ἀποστόλος* is key; though it is used for the apostles, it also has a broader meaning of “messenger,” allowing for community authorship.  \n\n**Bottom line**\n\n- **Where traditional consensus sits**: The Gospel was written by John the Apostle, the son of Zebedee, who was a member of the Inner Circle and a close, eyewitness follower of Jesus.  \n- **What the scholarship says**: Scholars differ on whether the author was the apostle himself or an anonymous community writer in the first century. The traditional view remains dominant in ecclesiastical teaching, but modern academic scholarship keeps the Johannine authorship discussion open.\n\nThis summary captures both the most widely accepted position and the principal alternatives that continue to be discussed by biblical historians.",

            "Some internal statements (e.g., the “beloved disciple” being an eyewitness to “many of the miracles and teachings in which he was present”) are broadly plausible but should be carefully differentiated from explicit textual claims; the narrative does not always align with the asserted specifics.",
            "Overall, while the answer captures traditional attribution and outlines major scholarly positions, several precise factual details about the text (language usage, specific verse claims, and the exact nature of “the beloved disciple”) are inaccurate or misrepresented."

          "rationale": "The response correctly notes the traditional view (John the Apostle) and outlines scholarly alternatives, which is appropriate. However, it contains several factual inaccuracies and overstatements (especially about the use of ἀποστόλος, specific verse claims about the beloved disciple’s role in resurrection claims, and the mischaracterization of John 17 and related verses). These errors affect the factual reliability of the answer, though the nuance about tradition vs. scholarship is handled well."
