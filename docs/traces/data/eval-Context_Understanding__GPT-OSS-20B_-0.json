          "rationale": "The LLM’s statement aligns with traditional and broadly accepted teaching: John the Apostle wrote the Gospel of John and was one of Jesus’ twelve disciples; he is the “beloved disciple” (the disciple whom Jesus loved). The identification as the son of Zebedee and brother of James is supported by Scripture (the sons of Zebedee appear in Mark 3:17; the Gospel of John’s references to the beloved disciple align with John 13:23, 19:26, 21:7). This reflects orthodox teaching and is biblically grounded. Nuance: it implicitly acknowledges that authorship attribution to John is historically traditional and not uncontroversial in modern scholarship (some scholars propose a Johannine community rather than a single named author). It also notes that the “beloved disciple” is a title used in John’s Gospel, not a self-identification by name, which is an important nuance in biblical interpretation. Overall, a doctrinally sound and biblically grounded summary with appropriate nuance."
