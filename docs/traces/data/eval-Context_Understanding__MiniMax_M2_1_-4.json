    "output": "# The Primary Audience of the Sermon on the Mount\n\n## The Immediate Setting\n\nAccording to the Gospel accounts, Jesus went to a mountain to teach, and both his disciples and large crowds gathered to hear him. Matthew 5:1 specifically states: \"Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them.\"\n\n## The Primary Audience: Jesus' Disciples\n\nThe primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount was Jesus' disciples. The text indicates that Jesus specifically addressed his followers, teaching them the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven. The Sermon contains what would become the core teachings of Christian ethics and discipleship: the Beatitudes, the Lord's Prayer (in Matthew's version), instructions on loving enemies, and the call to pursue righteousness exceeding that of the scribes and Pharisees.\n\n## The Presence of the Crowds\n\nHowever, Luke's account (Luke 6:17-19) reveals that a great multitude from Judea, Jerusalem, and surrounding regions had gathered to hear Jesus and be healed. This suggests that while Jesus' disciples were the primary audience, the crowds also listened and witnessed his teaching. Some scholars suggest the teachings had a dual application—both for intimate disciple formation and for public proclamation of the kingdom's values.\n\n## Scholarly Perspective\n\nThe traditional and majority view holds that Jesus was primarily training his disciples for their future ministry, with the crowds as witnesses. This interpretation aligns with Jesus' pattern throughout the Gospels of giving deeper instruction to his followers while teaching the public through parables and simpler messages.",

          "rationale": "The answer accurately reflects the scholarly consensus and the biblical text. It correctly notes Matthew 5:1 presents Jesus addressing his disciples, with the crowds also present, and cites Luke 6:17-19 to show the broader crowd/healing context. It acknowledges the traditional/majority view that the Sermon primarily trained Jesus’ disciples, while also recognizing that the crowds could hear and witness, suggesting a dual audience or dual application. It also references the broader pattern in the Gospels (deeper instruction for disciples vs. public teaching through parables) to provide nuance. A minor omission is the explicit distinction that Luke’s account is typically labeled the Sermon on the Plain rather than on a mountain, but this does not detract from answering the primary audience question. Overall, the response is accurate, reasonably complete, and appropriately nuanced.}"
