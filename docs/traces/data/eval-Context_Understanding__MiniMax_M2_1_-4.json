The biblical text states: \"Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to teach them.\" This opening establishes that Jesus specifically gathered his followers to deliver this foundational teaching on the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\n## The Role of the Crowds\n\nWhile disciples are identified as the primary audience, the crowds were also present during this event. Matthew notes that Jesus first \"saw the crowds\" before ascending the mountain, and the conclusion of the sermon (Matthew 7:28-29) indicates that the crowds were present when Jesus finished speaking and \"were amazed at his teaching.\" Some scholars suggest that portions of the sermon, particularly the Beatitudes, may have been addressed broadly to all who were assembled, as they speak to those experiencing various forms of suffering and need.\n\n## Scholarly Perspectives\n\nBiblical scholars have debated whether this sermon should be understood as:\n- An inaugural address specifically for disciples, establishing the ethics and character of kingdom citizens\n- A public teaching in which the crowd participated alongside the disciples\n- A combination of both, with Jesus addressing his closest followers while the multitude listened\n\nThe majority scholarly view holds that the disciples were the intended primary recipients who would carry these teachings forward and establish the early Christian community. However, the universal applicability of the sermon's ethical teachings extends beyond this initial audience to all who would follow Jesus's way of life.",

            "The claim that 'the majority scholarly view' holds the disciples were the primary recipients may overstate consensus; many scholars acknowledge a two-layer audience (disciples primarily, with crowds listening) or debate about the extent to which Beatitudes and other sections address the crowd versus the inner circle.",
            "The statement about Beatitudes 'particularly' addressing the broad assembly is plausible but debated; some scholars view the Beatitudes as primarily addressing the disciples or the kingdom community, rather than a universal address to all present."

          "rationale": "The response accurately reflects the text of Matthew 5:1-2 (crowds present, disciples addressed) and notes the crowd’s presence and the broad applicability of the ethical teaching. It effectively captures common scholarly perspectives (disciples as primary audience with crowds present and multi-layered interpretation). However, it asserts a broad majority view about audience consensus that is not universally agreed, and it implies Beatitudes were broadly addressed to all present in a way that is debated among scholars. The core facts are correct, and the nuance is present, but the consensus claim and some tonal specifics could misrepresent the range of scholarly positions."
