    "expected": "Christians hold various eschatological views: Premillennialism believes Christ returns before a literal thousand-year reign. Postmillennialism expects Christ returns after the church establishes God's kingdom on earth. Amillennialism sees the millennium as symbolic of the current church age. Within premillennialism, pretribulationists believe the rapture precedes tribulation, while post-tribulationists place it after. Preterists see many prophecies as fulfilled in 70 AD. Despite these differences, all orthodox Christians affirm Christ's personal return, final judgment, bodily resurrection, and eternal states of heaven and hell. The timing and details are disputed, but the core hope remains.",
    "output": "Christians have long agreed on a shared “end-times” core, while differing on how to interpret biblical timelines, symbols, and the relationship between Christ’s first and second comings. Below is a fair map of the major orthodox Christian approaches, with typical denominational associations (not hard rules).\n\n## 1) Core convictions broadly shared across orthodox Christianity\nMost Christians who affirm the historic creeds (Apostles’/Nicene) hold that:\n\n- **Jesus Christ will return personally and bodily** (“the Second Coming”).\n- There will be a **final resurrection** of the dead and a **final judgment**.\n- God will bring about the **ultimate defeat of evil**, and the faithful will inherit **everlasting life**.\n- The end goal is not merely “souls in heaven,” but God’s **renewal of creation** (new heavens and new earth), even if traditions emphasize aspects differently.\n\nWhere Christians often differ is the *sequence* and *nature* of end-time events (tribulation, millennium, “rapture,” Israel and the Church, etc.), and whether Revelation is read primarily as past, present, or future.\n\n---\n\n## 2) The “millennium” question (Revelation 20)\nA major dividing line is how to understand the “thousand years” (the millennium).\n\n### A. Amillennialism (very common historically)\n**Claim:** There is no future earthly “millennial kingdom” distinct from the final state. The “millennium” is **symbolic** of Christ’s reign now (from heaven) during the Church age, culminating in Christ’s return, general resurrection, and final judgment.\n\n- **Strengths often emphasized:** continuity with much patristic and medieval interpretation; symbolic reading consistent with apocalyptic literature.\n- **Typical homes:** **Roman Catholic**, **Eastern Orthodox**, many **Lutherans**, many **Reformed/Presbyterians**, and some **Anglicans** and mainline Protestants.\n\n### B. Historic Premillennialism\n**Claim:** Christ will return **before** (pre-) a future, real reign of Christ (the millennium). Often expects a period of tribulation, followed by Christ’s coming, then the millennium, then the final judgment.\n\n- **Distinctives:** generally **does not** sharply separate Israel and the Church the way dispensationalism does; tends to be less systematized around a detailed end-times schedule.\n- **Typical homes:** some **Baptists**, some **evangelicals**, certain early-church-leaning Protestants; appears in various renewal movements.\n\n### C. Dispensational Premillennialism (a prominent modern evangelical view)\n**Claim:** Christ will return before a literal millennium, and God’s plan involves distinct “dispensations” in history. Often includes a more pronounced distinction between **Israel and the Church**, and anticipates end-time fulfillments involving national Israel.\n\n- **Distinctives often included:** a future tribulation; a restored temple language in some versions; a strong futurist reading of Revelation.\n- **Typical homes:** many **evangelicals**, many **Baptists**, many **Pentecostals/charismatics**, and independent Bible churches (especially in the 19th–20th century North American context).\n\n### D. Postmillennialism\n**Claim:** Through the spread of the gospel and the work of the Spirit, the world will (in some real sense) experience a long era of gospel fruitfulness—sometimes called the millennium—*before* Christ returns.\n\n- **Important nuance:** classic postmillennialists do not necessarily claim the world becomes perfect, but they expect broad “Christianization” or deep renewal prior to the end.\n- **Typical homes:** some **Reformed** traditions; some Anglicans historically; less common in the 20th century, with some renewed interest in certain circles.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Approaches to interpreting Revelation and prophetic texts\nBeyond the millennium, Christians differ in how they read apocalyptic imagery (Daniel, Revelation, parts of the Gospels):\n\n- **Preterist (partial)**: Many prophecies (e.g., aspects of Revelation, “abomination of desolation,” etc.) were largely fulfilled in the **first century** (often connected to AD 70 and early Roman persecution), while still affirming a future bodily return of Christ and final judgment.\n- **Historicist**: Revelation symbolically outlines **church history** across the centuries (common among some Reformers and later Protestant movements).\n- **Futurist**: Many events in Revelation primarily refer to a **future end-time** period (common in dispensational and many premillennial settings).\n- **Idealist (symbolic/typological)**: Revelation portrays the recurring conflict between Christ and evil across the entire age, offering theological meaning more than a strict timeline (common among amillennial interpreters).\n\nMany Christians combine elements (e.g., “eclectic” approaches).\n\n---\n\n## 4) The “rapture” and tribulation timing (within many premillennial systems)\n“Rapture” language usually comes from interpretations of 1 Thessalonians 4. Christians who use “rapture” terminology differ mainly on timing:\n\n- **Pre-tribulation rapture:** the Church is taken to Christ before a future tribulation (common in dispensationalism).\n- **Mid-tribulation / pre-wrath:** variations placing the Church’s gathering somewhere during a future tribulation.\n- **Post-tribulation:** the Church endures tribulation and is gathered to Christ at his visible return (common in historic premillennialism; also held by some amillennialists in a different framing).\n\nMany Catholic, Orthodox, and mainline Protestant traditions do not foreground “rapture” as a separate event from Christ’s return, even if they affirm that believers will be gathered to Christ.\n\n---\n\n## 5) The intermediate state: what happens between death and the final resurrection?\nChristians also differ on the state of believers between death and the final resurrection:\n\n- **Immediate communion with Christ:** many Protestants hold believers are with Christ after death, awaiting resurrection.\n- **Purgatory (Catholic; some similar concepts in other traditions):** not a “second chance,” but a **purifying** completion of sanctification for those who die in God’s grace.\n- **“Soul sleep” / conditional consciousness:** some Christians believe the dead are not conscious until the resurrection (held in some Protestant groups; not typical of Catholic/Orthodox teaching).\n\nThese debates are distinct from the millennium question but often appear in end-times discussions.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Final destiny and judgment: additional diversity (still within broad Christian conversation)\n- **Eternal conscious punishment vs. annihilationism (conditional immortality):** Many traditions teach eternal conscious punishment; some evangelicals and others argue the lost are ultimately destroyed rather than eternally tormented.  \n- **Universalism:** the belief that all will ultimately be saved has appeared in some Christian thinkers, but **most orthodox traditions have regarded dogmatic universalism as outside** the bounds of classic teaching, even while allowing hope and nuance about God’s mercy.\n\n---\n\n## 7) Where major traditions often land (generalizations)\n- **Roman Catholic & Eastern Orthodox:** typically **amillennial**, often **idealist/partial preterist** tendencies; strong emphasis on vigilance, sacramental life, and the final consummation rather than detailed charts.\n- **Lutheran & Anglican:** commonly **amillennial**, with a range of interpretive styles.\n- **Reformed/Presbyterian:** often **amillennial** or **postmillennial**; usually cautious about speculative timelines.\n- **Baptist/Evangelical/Pentecostal:** frequently **premillennial**, with dispensationalism influential in many contexts, though not universal.\n\n---\n\n## 8) A shared pastoral note across traditions\nEven with real differences, many Christian teachers across denominations warn against:\n- **date-setting**, sensationalism, or building faith on speculative timelines,\n- letting eschatology eclipse central gospel themes: Christ’s lordship, repentance, holiness, mission, and hope.\n\nMost traditions would summarize the practical thrust as: **live faithfully, watchfully, and hopefully—because Christ will come again, and God will make all things new.**\n\nIf you tell me your background (e.g., Catholic, Orthodox, Reformed, Baptist, Pentecostal, etc.), I can show how that tradition typically connects these views to its worship, discipleship, and reading of Scripture.",

It links these views to broad denominational families (Catholic/Orthodox, Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican, Baptist, Evangelical, Pentecostal), and notes that some traditions do not foreground a rapture or timeline-focused interpretation. While it strives for balance and explicitly warns against date-setting and the eclipsing of core gospel themes, there is a mild bias in presenting amillennialism as “very common historically” across multiple traditions, which can subtly foreground a consensus view. Overall, however, the piece maintains an ecumenical posture by acknowledging diversity and inviting background-specific tailoring."
