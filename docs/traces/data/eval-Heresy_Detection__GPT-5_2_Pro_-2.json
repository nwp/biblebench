    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "The preacher’s claim is **not biblical teaching** and, stated as he states it, represents a **classic heresy** (or at least a seriously unorthodox distortion): **salvation by human merit**.\n\n## Why it’s unbiblical\nScripture consistently teaches that sinners are **saved by God’s grace**, not by earning heaven through moral effort:\n\n- **Ephesians 2:8–9**: “By grace you have been saved through faith… **not a result of works**, so that no one may boast.”\n- **Titus 3:5**: “He saved us, **not because of works** done by us in righteousness, but according to his mercy…”\n- **Romans 3:20–24; 4:4–5**: justification is not wages earned; it is a gift received by faith.\n\nThe preacher’s language—“**achieved through good works**,” “**earn your way to heaven**”—turns salvation into a **transaction** where God rewards sufficiently moral people. That contradicts the gospel that Christ saves the ungodly (Rom 5:6–8).\n\n## What orthodox Christianity teaches instead\nHistoric, orthodox Christianity teaches:\n\n1. **We are justified (made right with God) by grace**, on account of Christ, received by faith—not by works.  \n2. **Good works are the fruit of salvation**, not the cause of it.\n\nThis same passage that denies works as the basis of salvation immediately affirms their proper place:\n\n- **Ephesians 2:10**: we are saved by grace, then **created in Christ for good works**.\n\nAnd James, often misunderstood, is not teaching “earn heaven,” but that genuine faith is never barren:\n\n- **James 2:17**: “Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.”  \nWorks **demonstrate** living faith; they do not purchase justification.\n\n## How the church has historically judged this idea\nThe claim closely resembles **Pelagianism** (the view that humans can achieve salvation by moral effort apart from grace), which was condemned by the church (e.g., **Council of Carthage (418)**; reinforced at **Orange (529)**). Even traditions that strongly emphasize the necessity of good works (Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox) still reject the idea that one can **earn** salvation apart from God’s initiating and sustaining grace.\n\n## Bottom line\nThe statement “If you live a good life, you will earn your way to heaven” is **not orthodox** and **not the gospel**. The biblical gospel is: **Christ saves by grace**, received by faith, and that saving grace **produces** a life of repentance and good works.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately identifies the preacher’s claim as unbiblical and aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy: salvation is by grace through faith, not by works; good works are the fruit of salvation, not the cause. It correctly cites key texts (Ephesians 2:8–9; 2:10; Titus 3:5; Romans 3:20–24; Romans 4; James 2:17) and emphasizes the distinction between justification and sanctification. It also situates the view within a classical condemnation of Pelagianism and notes the traditional rejection of earning salvation apart from grace. Nuance is present in noting that genuine faith is demonstrated by works, not merely declared, and that grace initiates and sustains salvation. Minor caveats could include a more explicit, nuanced treatment of how Catholic/Orthodox traditions describe merit within grace, and potential differences in interpretation of James across traditions, but these do not undermine the overall accuracy."
