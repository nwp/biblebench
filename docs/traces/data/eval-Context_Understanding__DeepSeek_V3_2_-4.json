          "rationale": "The Sermon on the Mount is given to Jesus' disciples in the presence of the crowds (Matthew 5:1). The LLM correctly identifies both groups as audiences: the disciples and a large crowd. The addition 'Galilean followers' is geographically plausible and aligns with the setting near Galilee, but it slightly narrows the crowd’s composition, which could include attendees from other regions. Overall, the answer aligns with biblical teaching and orthodox interpretation, and captures the core nuance that both disciples and the accompanying crowds are in view."
