This clearly identifies his disciples as the primary, intended audience.\n    *   The sermon concludes in Matthew 7:28-29 by noting that after Jesus finished, \"the crowds were amazed at his teaching.\" This confirms that a larger multitude was present and listening.\n\n2.  **The Nature of the Teaching:** The content of the sermon (e.g., the Beatitudes, the higher righteousness of the Kingdom, the Lord's Prayer, ethical imperatives) is fundamentally instruction for those committed to following Jesus and living as citizens of God's Kingdom. It outlines the character and conduct expected of his followers, making disciples the logical primary recipients.\n\n3.  **Historical and Social Context:**\n    *   Jesus' ministry was centered in Galilee, a mixed Jewish-Gentile region.

While its core originates from the historical Jesus, Matthew likely compiled and arranged teachings Jesus gave on multiple occasions (a practice common among ancient teachers) into this comprehensive discourse. Therefore, its *literary* audience is also the Matthean community—a likely Jewish-Christian church grappling with its identity and mission.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **Immediate Primary Audience:** Jesus' core group of disciples.\n*   **Immediate Secondary Audience:** A large, mixed crowd from Galilee and surrounding regions.\n*   **Literary Audience:** The early Christian community for whom the Gospel of Matthew was written, serving as a manual for discipleship and community life.\n\nThis dual audience—disciples and crowd—reflects a common dynamic in Jesus' ministry: he invested deeply in his close followers while also proclaiming his transformative message publicly to all who would listen.",

            "The claim of 'strong agreement among scholars' that the Sermon on the Mount is didactic material shaped for the early church may overstate the consensus; there is substantial scholarly debate about the precise literary audience (Matthean community) and the Sitz im Luke (life) of the sermon.",

          "rationale": "The answer correctly identifies the Sermon’s primary audience as Jesus' disciples and acknowledges that a larger crowd was present, aligning with the textual cues in Matthew 5:1–2 and 7:28–29. It also notes the Matthean community as a literary audience, which is a common scholarly view, and it discusses the public nature of the teaching. However, it overstates the unanimity of scholarly consensus on the Matthean/early-church readership and includes a speculative note about Gentile crowds (e.g., Decapolis) that is not explicit in the text. Overall, the response is accurate, thorough, and nuanced enough for the question, with minor overstatements and speculative language."
