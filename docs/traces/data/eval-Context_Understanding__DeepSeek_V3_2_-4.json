    "expected": "Jesus' disciples and the crowds who followed him",
    "output": "Based on the text of the Gospel of Matthew and its historical context, the **primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount was Jesus's disciples, with a larger crowd of general followers from Galilee and surrounding regions listening in.**\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential facts and key information:\n\n### 1. The Textual Evidence (Matthew 5-7)\n*   **Opening Verses (Matthew 5:1-2):** \"Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. **His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them.**\" This is the most crucial detail. The evangelist specifies that Jesus positioned himself to teach his core disciples directly.\n*   **The Crowd's Presence (Matthew 7:28-29):** \"When Jesus had finished saying these things, **the crowds were amazed at his teaching**, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.\" This confirms that a larger crowd was present and heard the sermon, but they are framed as witnesses to the teaching directed at the disciples.\n\n### 2. The Nature of the Content\nThe Sermon on the Mount outlines the ethics, values, and lifestyle of the Kingdom of Heaven. Its demands (e.g., radical purity, love for enemies, true piety, and single-minded devotion to God) are particularly suited for:\n*   **Commitment:** It calls for a level of commitment that goes beyond casual interest, aligning with the call to discipleship.\n*   **Community Standards:** It serves as a charter for the new covenant community (the Church) Jesus was forming, defining how his followers should live in relation to God and each other.\n\n### 3. Historical & Literary Context\n*   **In Matthew's Gospel:** The Sermon is placed early in Jesus's ministry (chapter 5-7), right after the call of the first disciples (Matthew 4:18-22). This literary structure presents the Sermon as the foundational instruction for those who have chosen to follow him.\n*   **As a Disciple-Making Tool:** The Sermon functions as a detailed expansion of Jesus's initial proclamation in Matthew 4:17: \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.\" It answers the question, \"What does life lived under God's reign look like?\" for those who have repented and followed him.\n\n### Scholarly Consensus & Alternative Perspective\n*   **Majority View:** Most scholars agree with the above reading: the disciples are the primary, intended audience, with the crowds as a secondary, overhearing audience. This fits the pattern in Matthew where Jesus gives deeper teaching to his disciples (e.g., parables explained in private).\n*   **Alternative View:** Some scholars, focusing more on the crowd's presence and the universal nature of the teachings, argue that Matthew presents the Sermon as a public manifesto of Jesus's kingdom message **aimed at Israel as a whole**, calling the nation to a higher righteousness. Even within this view, however, the call is for individuals to become disciples.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo summarize: **The Sermon on the Mount was delivered primarily to Jesus's disciples as foundational training for life in God's Kingdom. A large crowd from the Galilean populace was also present and heard the message, making them a secondary audience.** The content is meant to define discipleship, making the committed followers of Jesus its primary intended recipients, while its revolutionary ethics were also meant to amaze and challenge the wider public.",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the Sermon on the Mount as primarily addressed to Jesus’s disciples, with a larger crowd overhearing (supported by Matthew 5:1-2 and 7:28-29). It situates the sermon within Matthew’s narrative—early in Jesus’s ministry and linked to discipleship training (e.g., after the call of the disciples and as expansion of the kingdom-message). The response acknowledges the crowd’s presence and provides a nuanced view by noting alternative scholarly perspectives (e.g., a universal or Israel-focused reading) while maintaining the core point that disciples are the primary audience. It is thorough for a historical-contextual question and does not contain factual errors. Minor theological framing (e.g., “charter for the new covenant community”) reflects interpretive context but does not misstate the text. Overall, it directly answers the question with appropriate evidence and nuance."
