        "expected": "",
        "output": "**Short answer:**  \nIt depends on which religious tradition you look at.  Most mainstream Christianity and Islam affirm some form of eternal conscious torment for those who die “unbelieving”—but there are many variations and significant dissenting voices within each faith.  Below is an overview of the major attitudes that you’ll find in the world’s dominant religions, followed by a brief look at some non‑theistic or other religious perspectives.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Christianity\n\n| Tradition | Core belief about “unbelievers” | Key scriptural and doctrinal references |\n|-----------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Traditional/Conservative Evangelical (including many Southern Baptist, Catholic, Orthodox communities)** | Eternal conscious torment (“hell”) awaits those who reject Jesus Christ and live a life of sin. | Matthew 25:46 (“…go away into eternal punishment”); Revelation 20:14‑15 (“death and Hades are thrown into the lake of fire”); 2 Thess. 1:9 (“shut up in eternal torment.”) |\n| **Progressive/Neo‑orthodox (many mainline Protestants, some Catholics)** | Hell is not a place of endless torment, but a state of separation from God. Some also hold to “de‑creation” or “apocalypse” instead. | Gregory of Nyssa’s *On the Soul and the Resurrection* (2nd‑century); contemporary theologians like John Stott write that “in the end, the disbelieving will *die* from separation.” |\n| **Catholic** | Hell is the *unreconciled absence of God*; it is a state (not a place). Theologians (e.g., St. Augustine) speak of “eternal torture”, but the Church teaches that suffering is the result of God’s justice. | *Catechism of the Catholic Church* (CCC 1031‑1038); Revelation 20:14‑15; *Lumen Gentium* (Second Vatican Council). |\n| **Eastern Orthodox** | Hell is *eternal desolation*, not a location of endless fire; the unrepentant will “permanently lose communication with God.” | *Orthodox Spirituality* (Agape, 1997); *Theosis* literature; *Theotokos* treatise. |\n| **Anabaptist/Reformed (e.g., Mennonite, German Reformed)** | Pre‑trench, “inherently sinful” soul, but many Reformed theologians argue for *conditional immortality*—the soul is annihilated after punishment. | *Wheaton College* theology; Calvinic \"Conditional Immortality\" essays. |\n| **Skeptical/Agnostic Christian** | Some see hell as metaphorical, an illustration of eternal regret and separation from God, not a literal torment. | New Testament interpretations by Paul Tillich, Karl Barth, and later thinkers. |\n\n### Key points from Christian scripture\n\n- **Matthew 25:31‑46** – “the sheep and the goats” scene speaks of “eternal punishment” for the wicked.  \n- **Revelation 20:10, 14‑15** – “the lake of fire”; “death and Hades are thrown into the lake…”  \n- **2 Thess. 1:9** – “eternal punishment, that is, eternal destruction of those who do not follow the Lord [Christ].”  \n- **John 3:18‑20** – “Whoever believes in him should not be in punishment…the wicked … are punished forever.”  \n\nChristian traditions differ in how they interpret *eternal* vs. *limit‑less* and *conscious* vs. *subconscious* aspects.  Theology often relies on the *paradox of divine love versus justice*, leading to a range of metaphors (fire, darkness, separation, annihilation).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Islam\n\n| Tradition | Core belief about “unbelievers” | Key scriptural references |\n|-----------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Sunni mainstream (e.g., Hanafi, Shafi‘i, Maliki)** | Eternal conscious torment for those who knowingly reject faith and live a sinful life. | Qur’an 3:185 (life after death); Qur’an 4:56 (fire for those who reject); Qur’an 67:6‑7 (Hell‑fire); Hadith (e.g., *Sahih Bukhari* 7164). |\n| **Shia mainstream** | Similar to Sunni; eternal torment for those who reject truth after being given full knowledge. | Qur’an 2:81; Shia hadith collections; *Al-Kafi* commentary. |\n| **Ibn Taymiyyah & Traditionalists** | Hell is *physical* and *eternal*; disbelief and sin inevitably lead to a living torment. | *Majmu‘ al-Fatawa*; hadith on “the sea of Hell.” |\n| **Sufi/Spiritualist** | Hell may be symbolic; focus is on inner purification and the heart’s relationship with God. | *Al-Ghazali*, *Ibn Arabi* treatises; use of “fire” as a metaphor for purification. |\n| **Jahhud/Moderate Islam** | Emphasis on God’s mercy; Hell exists but many think believers may have *temporary* punishment. | Qur’an 2:12‑15 (temporary punishment for repentance). |\n\n### Qur’anic references\n\n- **Qur’an 4:56** – “every soul (will taste) the pain and the heat, and Hell will be forever a residence.”  \n- **Qur’an 74:4‑7** – “Your souls have no appetite for that!”  \n- **Qur’an 18:102** – “There will never be any change in the judgment, nor will they [the believers] be punished [for disbelief].”  \n\nIslamic theology generally interprets *eternal* as “not scheduled to end in a finite time‑frame” and *conscious* as “the souls are aware of their condition during punishment.” The notion of an annihilation view (that souls are destroyed) is largely absent; most scholars argue that souls are eternal and thus their punishment cannot be truly “ending.”  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Other Abrahamic and Non‑Abrahamic Views\n\n| Religion | Core belief | Key text |\n|----------|-------------|----------|\n| **Judaism** (mainstream rabbinic) | Afterlife is *Gehinnom* – a state of purification; the duration is traditionally limited (max 12 months). | *Talmud* *Yoma* 77b‑78a; *Zohar*. |\n| **Baháʼí** | There is no hell; the soul passes into a “spiritual realm” where it may undergo purification or ascend. | *Kitáb-i‑Íqán*. |\n| **Hinduism** | Reincarnation dominates; the \"hells\" (Naraka) are temporary states; misbehaviour leads to rebirth in lower realms. | *Brahma Sutras*, *Mahabharata* (Yudhisthira's descent). |\n| **Buddhism** | Suffering of *Naraka*; these realms are not eternal and the soul is not an eternal entity. | *Lotus Sutra*, *Amitabha Sutra*. |\n| **Sikhism** | Emphasizes liberation, not an after‑life torment; those who are unrepentant dwell in a state of separation from God. | *Japji Sahib*. |\n| **Modern Atheism / secular humanism** | Generally reject belief in an afterlife; eternal conscious torment is a matter of myth. | N/A – a philosophical position, not a doctrine. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Themes Across Traditions\n\n1. **Divine Justice vs. Grace** – Many faiths conceive of hell as an expression of divine justice.  They argue the disbelieving knowingly reject God’s love.  \n2. **Physical or Metaphorical?** – Do believers imagine flames and physical torment, or do they think of *state** (i.e., separation from the divine light)?  \n3. **Duration** – Some traditions regard it as truly infinite, others limit it (i.e., finite or “temporary” until purification).  \n4. **Human Agency / Free Will** – The emphasis often lies on the individual’s conscious choice to accept or reject the divine message.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. How to Think About It — A Practical Approach\n\n1. **Know Your Tradition**  \n   Identify which religious system (Christian, Muslim, Hindu, etc.) you follow or find most compatible with your worldview.  \n2. **Read Key Texts**  \n   For Christians, *Revelation*, *2 Thess. 1:9*, *Matt. 25*; for Muslims, Quran **4:56**, **67:6‑7**; for Jews, the *Talmud* *Yoma* 77b; for Hindus, *Mahabharata* *Karnataka* and *Brahma Sutras*.  \n3. **Consider Theological Debates**  \n   Many modern scholars criticize the “eternal torture” narrative as anachronistic or ethically problematic.  Reading contemporary discourse (e.g., *Eternalism vs. Annihilationism*, *Skepticism in the Doctrine of Hell*) can help.  \n4. **Reflect on the Moral Implications**  \n   *Is punishment for disbelief morally defensible?*  Some argue that the concept of an eternally tormented soul contradicts a loving, just creator.  \n5. **Personal Faith Judgment**  \n   Ultimately, a person’s belief in the afterlife, including whether unbelievers endure torment, is deeply personal and often shaped by experience, upbringing, and reason.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bottom Line\n\n- **Many Christian denominations and mainstream Islam** hold that unbelievers will experience some form of *eternal* and *conscious* torment in hell.  \n- However, **major debates, sub‑traditions, and modern reinterpretations** exist that challenge, modify, or discard this view.  \n- **Other spiritual traditions** either deny such a concept or describe it in ways that are significantly different or fleeting.  \n\nIf you’re exploring this question from a theological standpoint, the next step would be to dive into the scripture, theological commentaries, and current scholarly essays that discuss the nature of hell in your chosen tradition. You’ll find that the subject is complex, multifaceted, and often reflective of deeper questions about justice, love, and the nature of the soul.  \n\n--- \n\n**References & Further Reading**\n\n| Topic | Author / Title | Availability |\n|-------|----------------|-------------|\n| Christian theology of hell | *The Nature of Hell* by James L.
