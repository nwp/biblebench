    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "My dear friend, thank you for trusting me with this vulnerable part of your life. I can sense the weight you're carrying—not just from the depression itself, but from the added burden of those well-meaning but misguided voices questioning your faith. As a pastor who's walked alongside many in similar valleys, let me assure you from the start: You are not failing spiritually. Depression is a complex struggle that touches body, mind, and spirit, and seeking help through medication is not a sign of weak faith but often a wise stewardship of the resources God provides. Let's unpack this together, drawing from Scripture, with both truth and tenderness.\n\nFirst, let's address the heart of your question: Is depression a spiritual failing? The Bible doesn't portray it that way. Scripture is full of godly people who wrestled with deep despair, and their stories remind us that faithfulness isn't measured by the absence of pain but by turning to God amid it. Think of Elijah, a mighty prophet who, after a great victory, sank into such despair that he prayed to die (1 Kings 19:4). He wasn't rebuked for lack of faith; instead, God met him with gentle care—providing rest, food, and a quiet whisper to renew his strength. Or consider David, who poured out his anguish in the Psalms: \"Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?\" (Psalm 42:5, 11). Even Jesus, in His humanity, experienced profound sorrow in Gethsemane, sweating drops of blood in anguish (Luke 22:44). If these heroes of faith grappled with emotional darkness, how can we say your struggle means you're not trusting God enough?\n\nThose who tell you to \"just have more faith\" or ditch the medication might be echoing a incomplete understanding of God's sovereignty. Yes, faith is vital—Hebrews 11 celebrates it as the assurance of things hoped for—but it's not a magic formula to bypass suffering. In fact, God often works *through* our weaknesses to display His power. Paul pleaded with God to remove his \"thorn in the flesh\" (likely a physical or emotional affliction), but God responded, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness\" (2 Corinthians 12:9). Your medication could very well be part of that grace—a tool God has given through medical science, much like He provided manna in the wilderness or healing herbs in Ezekiel 47:12. Dismissing it as unspiritual ignores how God uses human means for His purposes. As Proverbs 17:22 says, \"A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.\" Sometimes, that \"good medicine\" includes professional help to restore balance.\n\nThat said, let's talk practically. You're already taking a brave step by being on medication—keep partnering with your doctor to monitor and adjust as needed. But don't stop there. Surround yourself with a supportive community that affirms both faith and mental health care. Find a church or small group where leaders understand that therapy and prayer aren't opponents but allies. If those critical voices are persistent, it might help to gently redirect them with Scripture, like reminding them of Job's friends who wrongly assumed his suffering was due to sin (Job 42:7-8). And nurture your spirit: Spend time in God's Word, perhaps meditating on Psalms of lament (like 34:18: \"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit\"). Prayer, even when it feels dry, invites God into the fog. Consider Christian counseling that integrates faith and psychology—it's a beautiful way to address root causes while leaning on Jesus.\n\nFriend, God sees you, loves you, and is not disappointed in you. Your perseverance in seeking help is itself an act of faith, trusting that He heals in His timing and ways. You're not alone in this; many saints have walked this path and emerged stronger. If you'd like, we can pray together right now: Heavenly Father, wrap Your arms around this precious child of Yours. Lift the cloud of depression, grant wisdom to their doctors, and silence the voices of doubt. Remind them of Your nearness in their weakness, and fill them with hope in Your unfailing love. In Jesus' name, Amen.\n\nIf this resonates or you want to share more, I'm here. Let's walk this road together, one step at a time. Grace and peace to you.",

            "One factual slip: Ezekiel 47:12 is not literally about 'healing herbs' in the way that phrase is sometimes summarized. The verse describes trees along the river whose leaves are for healing in some translations, but the precise wording and interpretation often cited as 'healing herbs' is a simplification or misquote of the text. The overall point that God provides restorative means through creation is sound, but the specific scriptural reference could be stated more precisely."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response aligns well with orthodox Christian teaching on depression and approaches it with compassion and biblical grounding. It affirms that depression is not a spiritual failing, emphasizes that God works through weakness, and supports using medical treatment alongside spiritual disciplines and community. It cites biblical examples (Elijah, David, Jesus, Paul) to illustrate faithful struggle and God’s care, and it balances prayer with professional help. A minor scriptural precision issue about Ezekiel 47:12 detracts slightly from exact biblical grounding, but does not undermine the overall theological point. The nuance is strong: it recognizes that faith and medicine cooperate, cautions against simplistic “just have more faith” advice, and encourages pastoral and clinical steps."
