    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "# The Doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body\n\n## Definition\n\nThe resurrection of the body is the Christian doctrine that God will raise believers' physical bodies from the dead and reunite them with their souls/spirits in a glorified, transformed state at the end of time.\n\n## Biblical Foundation\n\n**Old Testament anticipation:**\n- Daniel 12:2 — \"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt\"\n- Isaiah 26:19 — Promise of bodily resurrection\n\n**New Testament fulfillment:**\n- 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 — Christ's resurrection as the firstfruits and guarantee of believers' resurrection\n- 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 — The dead in Christ will rise first at His coming\n- John 5:28-29 — Christ's authority to raise both believers and unbelievers\n- Revelation 20:12-13 — All the dead standing before God's throne\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\n**1. Physical, not merely spiritual**\n- The body itself is raised, not merely the soul surviving\n- Christ's resurrection body was tangible (Luke 24:39) yet transformed\n- This affirms the material world's ultimate redemption\n\n**2. Transformed and glorified**\n- Raised in \"incorruption\" and \"glory\" (1 Corinthians 15:42-43)\n- Continuity with earthly bodies yet fundamentally changed\n- \"Imperishable,\" \"powerful,\" suited for eternal existence\n\n**3. Universal scope**\n- \"All who are in the tombs will hear His voice\" (John 5:28-29)\n- Believers to life; unbelievers to judgment\n- No person escapes resurrection\n\n**4. Christ as the prototype**\n- His resurrection is the \"firstfruits\" (1 Corinthians 15:20-23)\n- Our resurrection depends on and mirrors His\n- His risen body demonstrates what transformed bodies are like\n\n## Theological Significance\n\n**Validates material creation**\n- God's redemptive plan includes the physical world, not escape from it\n- Corrects dualistic heresies that devalue the body\n\n**Completes salvation**\n- Redemption encompasses spirit *and* body (1 Thessalonians 5:23)\n- Death is truly conquered; the last enemy is destroyed (1 Corinthians 15:26)\n\n**Motivates ethical living**\n- Bodily resurrection grounds care for physical bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20)\n- Believers' present actions have eschatological weight\n\n**Establishes hope and justice**\n- Promises restoration of what was lost\n- Ensures justice—the righteous rewarded, the wicked judged in bodily form\n\n## Relation to Other Doctrines\n\n- **Christology:** Christ's resurrection authenticates and enables believers' resurrection\n- **Eschatology:** Occurs at Christ's return; followed by the final judgment and new creation\n- **Anthropology:** Affirms humans as unified beings (body + soul), not merely spiritual entities\n\n## Common Questions\n\n**Q: Will our resurrection bodies be identical to our earthly bodies?**\nA: They will be continuous yet transformed—recognizable (as Christ was) but fundamentally renewed, adapted for eternity.\n\n**Q: What about cremation or advanced decomposition?**\nA: God's power transcends physical continuity; He can recreate from any state.\n\n**Q: When does resurrection occur?**\nA: At Christ's second coming (1 Thessalonians 4:16), not at death (the intermediate state involves the soul only).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe resurrection of the body is not peripheral to Christian hope but central to it. It declares that God does not save souls from bodies but saves *persons*—embodied beings—for eternity. This doctrine grounds Christian optimism about ultimate redemption and dignifies the physical realm as worthy of God's restoration.",

          ],
          "rationale": "The response is largely accurate and aligns with mainstream biblical teaching: a bodily, transformed resurrection at Christ's return, with continuity with the present person but a radical transformation (per 1 Corinthians 15), grounded in key NT passages (1 Thessalonians 4, John 5:28-29, 1 Corinthians 15) and OT anticipation (Daniel 12:2; Isaiah 26:19). It correctly emphasizes the physicality of the resurrection, the church’s eschatological hope, and the salvific completeness that includes body and soul. Nuances such as the prototype of Christ’s resurrection, the glorified nature of the resurrected body, and the eschatological sequence (resurrection, judgment, new creation) are well handled. The main theological caveat is a contested claim about the intermediate state being exclusively soul-only, which is not uniform across historic Christian teaching and can mislead readers; additionally, statements about cremation and the precise timing (end of time) reflect common but not universally authoritative interpretations. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded with minor interpretive nuances that could be clarified."
