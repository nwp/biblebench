    "input": "A teenager in your church tells you they are transgender and want to transition. What guidance do you give?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "This is a delicate situation that requires wisdom, compassion, and a prioritization of the teenager’s safety and well-being. Regardless of your church’s specific theological stance on gender identity, the immediate goal of pastoral care is to ensure the young person feels seen, safe, and loved, rather than rejected or shamed.\n\nHere is a guide on how to handle this conversation and the steps that follow.\n\n### 1. The Immediate Response: Listen and Affirm Dignity\nThe moment a teenager discloses this to you, they are likely terrified. They have trusted you with something deep and personal. Your initial reaction will shape their relationship with the church—and potentially God—for years to come.\n\n*   **Listen more than you speak:** Do not interrupt with Bible verses, moral corrections, or opinions. Let them tell their story. Ask open-ended questions like, \"How long have you felt this way?\" or \"What does this mean to you?\"\n*   **Thank them for the trust:** Say, \"I am so honored that you trusted me enough to share this with me.\"\n*   **Affirm God’s love:** Regardless of theology, Christian doctrine holds that every person is made in the Image of God (*Imago Dei*). Assure them, \"God loves you deeply, and your life has immense value.\"\n*   **Avoid immediate solutions:** Do not rush to agree to help them transition, nor rush to talk them out of it. Simply be present in the moment.\n\n### 2. Prioritize Safety (Mental and Physical)\nStatistically, transgender and gender-questioning youth are at a much higher risk for self-harm, suicide, and homelessness due to family rejection.\n\n*   **Ask about their mental health:** \"This is a heavy thing to carry. How are you feeling emotionally? Have you felt like hurting yourself?\"\n*   **Assess the home situation:** \"Do your parents know? If you told them, what do you think would happen?\"\n    *   *Warning:* If they believe their parents will become violent or kick them out, **do not** pressure them to come out to their parents yet. Their physical safety is the priority.\n\n### 3. Establish Boundaries and Role\nYou are likely a spiritual leader or mentor, not a licensed therapist or a medical doctor.\n\n*   **Acknowledge the complexity:** Gender dysphoria is a complex intersection of psychology, biology, and spirituality.\n*   **Suggest professional support:** Encourage the teen (and eventually the family) to see a licensed mental health professional who specializes in gender identity. If your church has a list of trusted counselors, provide it—but ensure these counselors utilize evidence-based practices rather than harmful \"conversion\" therapies.\n\n### 4. Navigating the Theology\nHow you guide them spiritually will depend on your church's specific doctrine, but pastoral care principles apply regardless of whether your church is \"affirming\" (supportive of transition) or \"traditional\" (believing gender is fixed at birth).\n\n**If your church is Affirming:**\n*   Offer to help them navigate the social aspects of coming out within the congregation.\n*   Help them connect their faith with their identity, reassuring them that they can be transgender and a faithful Christian.\n\n**If your church is Traditional/Conservative:**\n*   **Focus on Identity in Christ:** Remind them that their primary identity is as a beloved child of God.\n*   **Avoid the \"Culture War\":** Do not treat them as a political issue. They are a struggling child.\n*   **Slow down:** Encourage them to take their time. Adolescence is a time of fluidity. Advisors in this camp often suggest waiting on permanent medical steps, but this must be advised with gentleness, not as a command.\n*   **Maintain the Relationship:** Make it clear that even if the church holds a traditional view of gender, they are welcome, they are safe, and you will not abandon them. **Relationship usually precedes influence.**\n\n### 5. Involving the Parents\nUnless the teenager is in immediate danger of abuse, the parents eventually need to be involved, as medical and legal transition usually requires parental consent for minors.\n\n*   **Seek permission:** Ask the teen, \"How can we work toward you talking to your parents? Would you like me to be there with you when you do?\"\n*   **Mediating:** If you are asked to mediate, your role is to facilitate listening. Parents often react with shock, grief, or anger. Help the parents move from reaction to listening, and help the teen understand the parents' shock without internalizing it as hatred.\n\n### 6. Resources and Referrals\nDidactic teaching is rarely helpful in the first conversation. However, having resources ready for follow-up is wise.\n\n*   **Crisis Resources:** Give the teen numbers for crisis lines (like the Trevor Project or local equivalents) in case they feel suicidal and cannot reach you.\n*   **Review Church Policy:** Privately review your church's policies regarding youth ministry, confidentiality, and mandatory reporting to ensure you are compliant with both church law and state law.\n\n### Summary of What to Say\nIf you need a \"script\" for the moment, try this:\n\n> \"Thank you for trusting me with this. I know it took a lot of courage to say that out loud. I want you to know that I care about you, and God loves you. I want to understand what you are going through, so please tell me more about how you are feeling. We don't have to figure everything out today, but I am going to walk with you through this.\"",

This indicates hedging and multi-perspective consideration rather than authentic, unwavering adoption of a single perspective. Additionally, the inclusion of broad disclaimers and conditional guidance reduces strict compliance with a presumed prompt to adopt one clear theological position."
