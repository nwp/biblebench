    "input": "Will unbelievers experience eternal conscious torment in hell?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of whether unbelievers will experience **Eternal Conscious Torment (ECT)** is one of the most intense and historically significant debates within Christian theology.\n\nWhile the \"traditional\" view answers **yes**, there are three major biblical interpretations regarding the final fate of the wicked. All three views are held by Bible-believing theologians who seek to interpret Scripture faithfully, though they emphasize different passages and aspects of God’s character.\n\nHere is an overview of the three primary views:\n\n### 1. Eternal Conscious Torment (The Traditional View)\nThis view holds that hell is a place of unending suffering where the unsaved are separated from God and tormented consciously forever. This has been the dominant view in Western Christianity (both Catholic and Protestant) since the time of Augustine (4th–5th century AD).\n\n*   **The Argument:** The soul is inherently immortal; therefore, it must go somewhere forever. Because sin is an offense against an infinite God, it warrants an infinite punishment.\n*   **Key Scriptures:**\n    *   **Matthew 25:46:** \"Then they will go away to **eternal punishment**, but the righteous to eternal life.\" Proponents argue that if \"life\" is everlasting, the \"punishment\" must also be everlasting in duration.\n    *   **Revelation 14:11:** \"And the smoke of their torment will rise **for ever and ever**.\"\n    *   **Mark 9:48:** A description of hell where \"the worms that eat them do not die, and the fire is not quenched.\"\n\n### 2. Annihilationism (Conditional Immortality)\nThis view holds that the wicked will suffer for a time proportional to their sins, but will ultimately be destroyed and cease to exist. They believe immortality is a gift from God given only to the saved, not an inherent property of the human soul.\n\n*   **The Argument:** The Bible consistently contrasts \"eternal life\" with \"death\" and \"destruction,\" not \"torture.\" They argue that \"eternal punishment\" refers to a punishment with eternal *consequences* (irreversible destruction), not a process that goes on forever (eternal punishing). They also argue that infinite torture is inconsistent with a God of perfect justice and love.\n*   **Key Scriptures:**\n    *   **Matthew 10:28:** \"Rather, be afraid of the One who can **destroy both soul and body** in hell.\"\n    *   **Romans 6:23:** \"For the wages of sin is **death** [not torture], but the gift of God is eternal life.\"\n    *   **John 3:16:** \"...whoever believes in him shall not **perish** but have eternal life.\"\n    *   **2 Thessalonians 1:9:** \"They will be punished with **everlasting destruction**...\"\n\n### 3. Universal Reconciliation (Christian Universalism)\nThis view holds that hell is real, but it is temporary, remedial, and restorative. Proponents believe that through the judgment of fire, God will eventually purify sinners and bring them to repentance, ultimately reconciling all people to Himself through Jesus Christ.\n\n*   **The Argument:** If God’s desire is that \"none should perish\" and God is all-powerful, He will eventually succeed in saving everyone. They interpret the Greek word generally translated as \"eternal\" (*aionios*) to mean \"of the age\" or \"lasting for an age,\" implying a specific period of time rather than infinite duration.\n*   **Key Scriptures:**\n    *   **Colossians 1:19–20:** \"For God was pleased... through him to **reconcile to himself all things**, whether things on earth or things in heaven...\"\n    *   **Philippians 2:10–11:** \"...every knee should bow... and **every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord**, to the glory of God the Father.\" (Universalists argue this confession is voluntary and saving).\n    *   **1 Corinthians 15:22:** \"For as in Adam all die, so in Christ **all will be made alive**.\"\n\n### Summary of the Debate\nThe answer to your question depends on which theological framework one applies to the Bible:\n\n1.  **If you hold to Traditionalism:** Yes, unbelievers experience eternal pain.\n2.  **If you hold to Annihilationism:** No, they experience end-of-existence (death).\n3.  **If you hold to Universalism:** No, they experience temporary distinct judgment followed by restoration.\n\nWhile Eternal Conscious Torment is the most common view in history, Annihilationism has gained significant ground in the last century among evangelical scholars (such as John Stott and Clark Pinnock), who find it more consistent with the biblical language of \"destruction\" and God’s character.",
