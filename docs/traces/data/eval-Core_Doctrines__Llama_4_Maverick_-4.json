    "expected": "Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both biblical truths held in tension. God is completely sovereign over all things, yet humans are genuine moral agents responsible for their choices. Scripture teaches both that God ordains all things and that humans make real choices for which they are accountable. Different theological traditions emphasize these aspects differently (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), but orthodox Christianity affirms both truths without fully resolving the mystery of how they relate.",
    "output": "The relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility is a complex and debated topic in Christian theology. At its core, it concerns the interaction between God's sovereign control over all things and the responsibility that humans have for their actions. A balanced understanding of this relationship is crucial for a coherent and biblically faithful theology.\n\n**Divine Sovereignty**\n\nDivine sovereignty refers to God's absolute authority, power, and control over all that exists. Scripture affirms that God is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe (Genesis 1:1; Psalm 103:19; Isaiah 46:9-10). His sovereignty is not limited by anything outside of Himself, and He is not thwarted by human decisions or actions (Proverbs 21:1; Romans 9:21). God's sovereignty encompasses all aspects of creation, including human history, personal lives, and the unfolding of His redemptive plan (Psalm 115:3; Ephesians 1:11).\n\n**Human Responsibility**\n\nHuman responsibility, on the other hand, refers to the accountability that humans have for their choices and actions. Scripture emphasizes that humans are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26-27) and are thus endowed with the capacity for moral agency, including the ability to make decisions and act upon them. Humans are exhorted to obey God's commands, to repent of their sins, and to exercise faith in Jesus Christ (Deuteronomy 30:19; Acts 17:30; Romans 10:9-10). The Bible assumes that humans are responsible for their actions, and this responsibility is a fundamental aspect of the human condition.\n\n**The Relationship between Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility**\n\nThe challenge lies in reconciling the seemingly paradoxical relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility. How can God's sovereign control over all things be compatible with human accountability for our choices and actions?\n\nTo address this issue, it's essential to consider several key factors:\n\n1. **Compatibilism**: One approach is to adopt a compatibilist perspective, which holds that human freedom is compatible with divine determinism. According to this view, human decisions and actions are still considered free and responsible, even if they are ultimately part of God's sovereign plan (see Philippians 2:12-13).\n2. **Mystery and Paradox**: Scripture presents the relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility as a mystery that is not fully resolvable by human understanding (Romans 11:33-36; Isaiah 55:8-9). We must acknowledge the limits of our comprehension and avoid reducing one aspect to the exclusion of the other.\n3. **Biblical Tension**: The Bible maintains a tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility throughout its narrative. For example, in the context of salvation, Scripture emphasizes both God's sovereign initiative (Ephesians 1:4-5; 2 Thessalonians 2:13) and human responsibility to respond in faith (John 3:16; Acts 16:31).\n4. **Non-Contradiction**: While the relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility may be mysterious, it is not inherently contradictory. God's sovereignty and human responsibility are not mutually exclusive; rather, they coexist in a complex and multifaceted relationship.\n\n**Key Biblical Passages**\n\nSeveral biblical passages provide insight into the relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility:\n\n1. **Genesis 50:20**: Joseph's statement to his brothers highlights the interplay between human actions and divine sovereignty: \"You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good.\"\n2. **Acts 2:23**: Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost affirms that Jesus was \"delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God,\" yet also emphasizes the responsibility of those who crucified Him.\n3. **Philippians 2:12-13**: Paul encourages believers to \"work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,\" while also affirming that \"it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility is a complex and multifaceted issue that resists simplistic resolution. A biblically grounded understanding acknowledges both the comprehensive nature of God's sovereignty and the genuine responsibility of humans for their choices and actions. By embracing the mystery and paradox inherent in this relationship, we can avoid reducing one aspect to the exclusion of the other and instead, strive for a nuanced and balanced theology that reflects the richness and complexity of Scripture.",

          "rationale": "The answer accurately presents the biblical tension between God’s sovereignty and human responsibility, aligns with core scriptures (Genesis 50:20; Acts 2:23; Phil. 2:12-13; John 3:16; Ephesians 1:4-5), and maintains orthodox perspectives on divine prerogative and human accountability. It demonstrates nuance by acknowledging mystery and biblical tension. Minor gaps include insufficient treatment of competing traditions (especially Arminian libertarian freedom) and a need for careful phrasing around determinism versus providence to prevent oversimplification."

          "explanation": "Overall, the response presents an orthodox (historic Christian) framework for divine sovereignty and human responsibility. It avoids denying the divinity of Christ, the Trinity, or salvation by grace; it does not teach Pelagianism, Modalism, Arianism, Gnosticism, or Docetism. It presents compatibilism as a philosophical/theological position rather than a heretical claim, acknowledges mystery, and cites key Scripture. A potential area of interpretive disagreement lies in the emphasis on compatibilism (divine determinism with human freedom), which some traditions dispute (e.g., libertarian free will). However, this is a legitimate, historically debated stance within orthodoxy, not a heresy."
