    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.' Is this teaching orthodox or heretical? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "The theological statement you’ve presented—*\"Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine—he was adopted as God’s son at his baptism\"*—is **heretical** according to historic, orthodox Christian doctrine. Here’s why:\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Heresy: Adoptionism**\nThe statement reflects a form of **Adoptionism**, an ancient Christological heresy that denies the eternal divinity of Jesus Christ. Adoptionism teaches that Jesus was a mere human who was \"adopted\" as God’s Son at a specific point in His life—most commonly at His baptism (as in this case), but sometimes at His resurrection or ascension.\n\nKey proponents of Adoptionism in early church history include:\n- **The Ebionites** (2nd century): Jewish-Christian sects that rejected Jesus’ divinity, seeing Him as a prophet but not God.\n- **Theodotus of Byzantium** (late 2nd century): Taught that Jesus was a virtuous man \"adopted\" by God at baptism.\n- **Paul of Samosata** (3rd century): Bishop of Antioch who denied Christ’s pre-existence and divinity, teaching that the Logos (Word) was a divine power that dwelled in Jesus but was not personally identical with Him.\n\nAdoptionism was condemned at multiple early church councils, including:\n- The **Council of Antioch (268 AD)**, which deposed Paul of Samosata.\n- The **Council of Nicaea (325 AD)**, which affirmed Christ’s eternal divinity in the Nicene Creed (\"God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father\").\n\n---\n\n### **2. Why Adoptionism is Heretical**\nOrthodox Christianity affirms that Jesus Christ is **fully God and fully man** (the **hypostatic union**), a doctrine defined at the **Council of Chalcedon (451 AD)**. Adoptionism undermines this in several ways:\n\n#### **A. Denial of Christ’s Eternal Divinity**\n- Scripture teaches that the **Son is eternally God** (John 1:1, 14; Colossians 1:15–19; Hebrews 1:3).\n- The **Nicene Creed** (325 AD) explicitly rejects Adoptionism by declaring Christ as *\"begotten, not made, of one Being (homoousios) with the Father.\"*\n- If Jesus were merely adopted at baptism, He would not be the eternal Word (Logos) through whom all things were made (John 1:3).\n\n#### **B. Misinterpretation of Jesus’ Baptism**\n- The statement claims Jesus was \"adopted\" at His baptism, likely referencing **Mark 1:11** (\"You are my beloved Son, with you I am well pleased\") or **Matthew 3:17**.\n- However, these verses **do not imply adoption** but rather **confirmation** of Jesus’ eternal sonship. The voice from heaven is a **theophany** (divine revelation) affirming what was already true: Jesus is the eternal Son of God (John 1:18; 3:16).\n- The baptism was not the moment Jesus became divine but the moment His divine identity was publicly declared.\n\n#### **C. Undermines Salvation**\n- If Jesus were only a human \"adopted\" by God, His death could not atone for sin (Hebrews 10:4–10). Only God Himself could offer a perfect, infinite sacrifice (Hebrews 9:14).\n- The **Apostle Paul** explicitly rejects Adoptionism in **Galatians 4:4–5**, where he writes that God sent *\"His own Son, born of a woman\"*—not a mere man who later became God’s Son.\n\n#### **D. Contradicts the Incarnation**\n- The **Incarnation** (John 1:14) means the eternal Son **took on human flesh**—He did not become divine at a later point.\n- **Philippians 2:6–7** teaches that Christ, *\"being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant.\"*\n- Adoptionism reverses this, making Jesus a man who later became divine, which is the opposite of orthodox Christology.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Biblical Refutations of Adoptionism**\nSeveral key passages contradict Adoptionism:\n- **John 1:1, 14** – The Word (Logos) was God and became flesh.\n- **John 8:58** – Jesus claims pre-existence (\"Before Abraham was, I am\").\n- **Colossians 2:9** – \"In Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form.\"\n- **Hebrews 1:3** – Christ is \"the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His being.\"\n- **Titus 2:13** – We await \"our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.\"\n\n---\n\n### **4. Modern Parallels**\nWhile Adoptionism was formally condemned in the early church, similar ideas resurface in modern movements:\n- **Unitarianism** (e.g., Jehovah’s Witnesses, Christadelphians, some liberal theology) denies Christ’s divinity, often teaching that He was a created being or a prophet.\n- **Mormonism** teaches that Jesus was a spirit child of God who became divine (though their theology is more complex and differs from historic Adoptionism).\n- **Liberal Protestantism** sometimes reduces Jesus to a moral teacher rather than the incarnate God.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Orthodox Christian Teaching**\nThe **Chalcedonian Definition (451 AD)** summarizes orthodox Christology:\n> *\"We confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, perfect in deity and perfect in humanity... begotten before all ages from the Father in respect to His deity, and in the last days, for us and for our salvation, born of Mary the Virgin in respect to His humanity; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, acknowledged in two natures without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.\"*\n\nThis means:\n- Jesus is **eternally God** (not adopted).\n- He **took on human nature** in the Incarnation (not the other way around).\n- His divine and human natures are **united in one person** (the hypostatic union).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe statement in question is **heretical** because it denies the eternal divinity of Christ, misinterprets His baptism, and undermines the biblical doctrine of the Incarnation. Historic Christianity has consistently rejected Adoptionism as incompatible with Scripture and the apostolic faith. The early church fathers, ecumenical councils, and creeds all affirm that Jesus Christ is **truly God and truly man**, not a mere human who was later adopted as God’s Son.",

It accurately notes that baptism is not the moment of Jesus becoming divine but a public affirmation of His divine Sonship, and it supports this with key biblical passages (John 1:1-14; John 8:58; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:3; Titus 2:13) and the incarnation texts (Philippians 2:6-7). It also cites early church responses (Ebionites, Paul of Samosata) and ecumenical milestones (Nicene Creed) to show historic orthodoxy. The response aligns with orthodox teaching that Jesus is eternally God and fully human, and rejects the view that He was a mere human adopted by God at baptism. Minor historical phrasing about specific councils is not doctrinally misleading in this context. Overall, it is academically sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."
