    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. As a parent, it's natural to feel devastated and scared when your child is struggling with their faith. First, let me assure you that it's not uncommon for teenagers to grapple with doubts and questions about their faith. In fact, it's a sign of a healthy and vibrant faith that they're wrestling with these issues.\n\nBefore we dive into what you can do, let's establish a crucial foundation: our response as parents and as the church should be guided by love, compassion, and a deep understanding of God's Word. We must resist the temptation to react impulsively or out of fear.\n\nFirst and foremost, I encourage you to take a deep breath, pray, and ask God to give you wisdom, patience, and a listening heart. It's essential to create a safe and non-judgmental space for your daughter to express her thoughts and feelings. When she shares her concerns, listen attentively to what she's saying, both verbally and non-verbally. Avoid being defensive or dismissive, as this could exacerbate the situation.\n\nIt's vital to acknowledge that her doubts and questions are valid and worth exploring. You can say something like, \"I'm here for you, and I want to understand what's going on. Can you tell me more about what's causing you to question your faith?\" This will help her feel heard and understood.\n\nAs you listen, try to discern the root of her doubts. Is it due to a particular experience, a misunderstanding about God or the Bible, or perhaps a influence from her peers or social media? Once you understand the underlying concerns, you can begin to address them together.\n\nIt's essential to remind your daughter that faith is not about having all the answers; it's about trusting in a God who is bigger than our understanding (Isaiah 55:8-9). We can point her to the many examples in Scripture of individuals who wrestled with faith and doubt, such as Thomas (John 20:24-29) and the Psalmist (Psalm 13, 22).\n\nAs you navigate this journey together, I recommend that you:\n\n1. Pray with your daughter, asking God to guide her and give her wisdom.\n2. Study Scripture together, focusing on passages that address doubt, faith, and the character of God (e.g., Psalm 23, Romans 8:28-39).\n3. Seek guidance from a trusted spiritual mentor or a youth pastor who can provide additional support and insight.\n4. Encourage your daughter to ask questions and explore her doubts in a safe and supportive environment.\n\nRemember, it's not your responsibility to \"fix\" your daughter's faith or provide all the answers. Your role is to be a loving, supportive parent who points her to the truth of God's Word and the love of Christ.\n\nAs you walk alongside your daughter, I encourage you to cling to the promises of Scripture, such as Jeremiah 29:11: \"For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\" Trust that God is at work in your daughter's life, even when she feels uncertain or lost.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to be vulnerable with your daughter about your own struggles with faith. Sharing your own experiences and how you've navigated doubts can help her feel more connected to you and more confident in her own journey.\n\nMay God grant you wisdom, patience, and love as you navigate this challenging but ultimately redemptive journey with your daughter.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response closely aligns with biblical and historic Christian guidance on how to respond to a teenager’s doubt. It emphasizes love, safety, listening, and not reacting in fear, which matches the expectation that doubt can be a part of faith development. It anchors its approach in Scripture (e.g., Isaiah 55:8-9; John 20:24-29; Psalms and Romans 8:28-39; Jeremiah 29:11) and models humility and vulnerability (sharing parental struggles) while encouraging prayer, Scripture study, mentoring, and gentle without-dismissal dialogue. It also explicitly discourages defensive reactions and pressing for easy fixes, which is pastorally sound. Minor gaps include the absence of an explicit citation to 1 Peter 3:15 (the expected answer’s specific exhortation to “give a reason for your hope with gentleness and respect”), and a few contextual cautions about using Jeremiah 29:11 in every situation. These do not substantially undermine theological accuracy or practical usefulness, but addressing them would bring it even more in line with the expected guidance."
