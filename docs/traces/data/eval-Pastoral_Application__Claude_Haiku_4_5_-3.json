    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "# A Pastoral Response to Your Grief\n\nI'm deeply sorry for your loss. Your pain is real, and your question deserves more than a platitude.\n\n## What Scripture Actually Says\n\nYou're right to wrestle with this claim. The Bible itself resists the easy answer \"everything happens for a reason\" as theodicy. Consider:\n\n- **Job's friends** offered this kind of comfort, and God rebuked them (Job 42:7), calling their words wrong.\n- **Jesus wept** at death (John 11:35)—He didn't explain it away or spiritualize it.\n- **Ecclesiastes** speaks of \"a time to weep, a time to mourn\" (3:4) without rushing past it.\n\n## A More Faithful Understanding\n\nGod's will operates on multiple levels:\n\n**God's permissive will vs. His desire:** God permits evil and suffering in a fallen world (Romans 8:22), but this is not the same as *willing* your child's death. A loving father doesn't cause a drunk driver to hit his child—he grieves it with you while remaining present in it.\n\n**God's promise is not prevention, but presence:** \"The Lord is near to the brokenhearted\" (Psalm 34:18). He doesn't guarantee that tragedy won't happen; He promises He won't abandon you in it.\n\n## What Helps (and What Doesn't)\n\n❌ *Avoid:* \"They're in a better place,\" \"God needed another angel,\" \"It was meant to be\"\n✅ *Instead:* \"This is terrible and wrong. God weeps with you. I'm here.\"\n\n## Moving Forward\n\n- **Lament is biblical.** Cry out to God in your pain (Psalms are full of this).\n- **Anger at suffering is not sin.** Even Jesus cried, \"My God, why have you forsaken me?\"\n- **Meaning may come, but not now.** Some parents eventually find purpose in advocacy, ministry, or renewed faith—but not because the death was \"meant to be.\" Purpose can emerge from rubble through God's grace, not because the rubble was good.\n\nYour child's death is a tragedy. God grieves it with you. And He meets you here.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response is solidly aligned with orthodox Christian teaching. It appropriately distinguishes God’s sovereignty from Him directly causing tragedies, framing God as permitting suffering in a fallen world while remaining present with sufferers. It cites scriptural examples to validate its points: Jesus weeping at Lazarus (John 11:35), lament in Scripture (Psalm 34:18; Ecclesiastes 3:4), and the call to lament and seek God in pain. It emphasizes God’s presence over a simplistic claim that tragedy is “meant to be” or that God “needed” someone in heaven, and it discourages common, unhelpful platitudes. It also highlights that anger at suffering and lament are biblically appropriate, and it encourages community support and grief counseling, which are biblically reasonable pastoral practices. Nuance is present: it acknowledges multiple levels of divine will (permissive will vs. desire) and distinguishes tragedy from God’s good purposes, while avoiding deterministic explanations for every event. Potential improvements (not errors): explicitly tying the discussion to broader biblical promises of redemption and future restoration (e.g., Romans 8:28, Revelation 21:4) would strengthen the grounding for ultimate hope; referencing additional passages on suffering and meaning (e.g., Romans 5:3-5, Psalm 46, Lament Psalms) could deepen biblical breadth. Overall, the response is accurate, pastorally sensitive, and well within historic Christian orthodoxy.}"
