    "input": "What does the Bible teach about homosexuality? Are homosexual relationships sinful, or is the biblical prohibition limited to exploitative contexts?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "This is one of the most significant and sensitive questions facing the contemporary church. To answer it as a theologian requires us to look beyond proof-texting and engage with hermeneutics (the science of interpretation), historical context, and the broader narrative of Scripture.\n\nCurrently, Christian theology regarding homosexuality is generally divided into two main camps: the **Traditional (or Non-Affirming) View** and the **Affirming (or Revisionist) View**. Both sides claim a high view of Scripture but differ fundamentally on how to interpret the relevant texts and the nature of human sexuality.\n\nHere is a balanced overview of how these perspectives engage the Bible.\n\n### 1. The Traditional View: The Argument for Design and Prohibition\nThe historic position of the Church—Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant—has been that Scripture prohibits all same-sex sexual acts and restricts marriage to a covenant between a man and a woman.\n\n**The Creation Narrative (Genesis 1–2):**\nTraditional theologians argue that the Bible defines marriage and sexuality in the opening chapters of Genesis. In Genesis 2:24, the formula for marriage is established: a man leaves his parents and cleaves to his wife, becoming \"one flesh.\" Jesus reaffirms this standard in Matthew 19:4-6. From this perspective, sexual difference (male and female complementarity) is not incidental but essential to the definition of marriage. Consequently, any sexual activity outside of this model falls short of God’s created intent (the Greek word associated with sin, *hamartia*, literally means \"missing the mark\").\n\n** Specific Prohibitions:**\n*   **Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13:** These texts describe lying with a male as with a woman as an \"abomination\" (*toevah*). Traditionalists argue that while Christians are not bound by ceremonial laws (like dietary restrictions), these verses sit within the \"Holiness Code\" and represent a timeless moral law regarding sexual ethics, similar to prohibitions against incest or adultery.\n*   **Romans 1:26-27:** This is often considered the most important text because it sits in the New Testament. Paul describes same-sex passions as \"unnatural\" (or \"against nature\") and a result of humanity giving up the Creator for idols. Traditionalists interpret \"against nature\" as a violation of the created order (Genesis 1-2).\n*   **1 Corinthians 6:9–10 & 1 Timothy 1:10:** Paul includes *arsenokoitai* and *malakoi* in lists of those who will not inherit the kingdom of God. Traditional scholars translate these terms as \"men who have sex with men\" (active and passive partners), viewing them as a blanket exclusion of same-sex behavior.\n\n**Conclusion of this view:** Homosexual behavior is viewed as sinful not because it is inherently hateful, but because it violates God’s design for human flourishing. Many holding this view distinguish between *temptation/attraction* (which is not sinful) and *acting on it* (which is).\n\n### 2. The Affirming View: The Argument for Context and Inclusion\nIn recent decades, biblical scholars and theologians have re-examined these texts, arguing that the modern concept of a loving, consensual, egalitarian same-sex relationship is not what the biblical authors were condemning.\n\n**Historical Context and Orientation:**\nAffirming theologians emphasize that the concept of \"sexual orientation\"—an innate, unchosen psycho-sexual attraction—did not exist in the biblical world. In antiquity, sexuality was viewed in terms of hierarchy and excess. Therefore, biblical authors were not condemning \"homosexuals\" (a category they didn't have) but rather exploitative practices.\n\n**Re-interpreting the Texts:**\n*   **Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19):** While historically cited against homosexuality, confirming scholars point to Ezekiel 16:49, which explicitly states the sin of Sodom was pride, gluttony, and a refusal to help the poor. The sexual threat in Genesis 19 was attempted gang rape (humiliation of strangers), not consensual love.\n*   **Leviticus:** Scholars argue these laws were about distinguishing Israel from Canaanite fertility cults and maintaining ritual purity, not universal moral absolutes applicable to Christians under the New Covenant.\n*   **Romans 1:** Affirming theologians argue Paul is describing the sexual excesses of heterosexuals who have \"exchanged\" their natural function for idolatrous lust (often associated with shrine prostitution). They argue Paul is condemning lust and idolatry, not the love between two people of the same sex who are \"by nature\" attracted to one another.\n*   **1 Corinthians 6 & 1 Timothy 1:** The translation of *arsenokoitai* is heavily debated. Some scholars argue it refers specifically to pederasty (men bedding boys) or economic exploitation via sex, rather than a supportive partnership.\n\n**The Trajectory of Scripture:**\nThis view emphasizes the \"fruit of the Spirit\" (Galatians 5) and the inclusion of Gentiles and eunuchs (Acts 8) as evidence that the Holy Spirit moves past rigid adherence to the letter of the law toward radical inclusion. If a same-sex marriage produces the fruit of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience), affirmationists argue it cannot be declared \"bad trees\" (Matthew 7:17-18).\n\n**Conclusion of this view:** The biblical prohibition is limited to exploitative, idolatrous, or lust-driven contexts. Faithful, covenantal same-sex relationships are viewed as capable of honoring God.\n\n### 3. Key Theological Considerations\n\nWhen navigating these views, two major theological concepts often determine where one lands:\n\n**A. Sola Scriptura vs. Experience & Reason**\nThe Traditional view relies heavily on the \"plain reading\" of the text and church tradition. They worry that prioritizing modern psychological understandings sets a dangerous precedent for overriding Scripture. The Affirming view argues that \"plain reading\" often misses historical context (much like seemingly pro-slavery arguments of the 19th century) and that the Holy Spirit speaks through human experience and reason to correct our interpretations.\n\n**B. The Definition of Marriage**\nThe debate results in two different definitions of marriage.\n*   For the **Traditionalist**, marriage is *gender-differentiated* for the sake of biological procreation and a symbolic representation of Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5).\n*   For the **Affirming Christian**, marriage is defined by *covenant fidelity*, regardless of gender, reflecting the loyalty and love of God.\n\n### Summary\nTo answer your specific question: **Does the Bible teach that homosexual relationships are sinful, or is it limited to exploitative contexts?**\n\n*   If you believe the Bible provides a timeless blueprint for gender and marriage in Genesis that is reaffirmed by Jesus and Paul, you will conclude that **all same-sex sexual acts are sinful** because they violate the created order.\n*   If you believe the biblical prohibitions are addressing specific cultural sins (pederasty, idolatry, exploitation) and that the overarching biblical ethic is love and fidelity, you will conclude that **the prohibitions are limited to exploitative contexts** and do not apply to modern, faithful gay relationships.\n\nRegardless of where one stands, most theologians today agree that the Church is called to treat LGBTQ+ individuals with dignity and love, acknowledging that for too long, Christian theology has been weaponized to cause deep psychological and spiritual harm.",
