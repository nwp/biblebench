    "input": "A couple asks: 'We're Christians living together before marriage. Is this really wrong? Everyone does it now, and we're committed to each other.'",
    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "My dear friends, thank you for coming to me with this honest and vulnerable question. It's clear from your words that you care deeply about your relationship, your faith, and doing what's right in God's eyes. As a pastor, I appreciate your willingness to seek counsel on this—it's a sign of humility and a desire to grow. Let's talk this through together, drawing from Scripture, with both the truth of God's Word and the grace He extends to all of us as sinners in need of His mercy. I'll aim to be straightforward yet compassionate, because Jesus Himself modeled that balance—speaking truth to the woman at the well with kindness, not condemnation (John 4:1-26).\n\n### Acknowledging Your Situation\nFirst, I want to affirm that your commitment to each other is a beautiful thing. In a world where relationships can be fleeting, it's encouraging to hear that you're serious about one another. And you're right—cohabitation before marriage has become incredibly common in our culture. Many couples, even Christians, see it as a practical step toward marriage, a way to test compatibility or save money. It's normalized in movies, TV, and among friends, so it's understandable why it might not feel \"wrong\" at first glance. But as followers of Christ, we're called to measure our lives not by what's popular or \"everyone does,\" but by God's unchanging standards. As Romans 12:2 urges us, \"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.\"\n\n### What Does Scripture Say?\nAt its core, the Bible presents marriage as a sacred covenant designed by God—a lifelong union between one man and one woman that reflects Christ's relationship with the Church (Genesis 2:24; Ephesians 5:31-32). Sexual intimacy is a gift meant to be enjoyed exclusively within that covenant, as a way to bond, honor, and celebrate that commitment. Hebrews 13:4 puts it plainly: \"Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.\" Living together before marriage often involves or leads to sexual activity (what Scripture calls fornication), which falls outside God's design. Even if that's not the case for you, cohabitation can blur boundaries and create temptations that Scripture warns against.\n\nThe Apostle Paul addresses this directly in 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5: \"It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God.\" And in 1 Corinthians 6:18-20, he reminds us, \"Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.\"\n\nIn short, yes, living together before marriage—especially if it involves intimacy—is contrary to God's will, not because He's a cosmic killjoy, but because He knows what's best for us. It can lead to emotional wounds, relational instability, and a diminished view of the marriage covenant. Studies even show that couples who cohabitate before marriage often face higher rates of divorce and dissatisfaction later on, which aligns with the idea that straying from God's blueprint brings unnecessary hardship.\n\n### Balancing Truth with Grace\nThat said, please hear this: God is not shocked or repulsed by your situation. He loves you immensely, and His grace is bigger than any mistake. Remember the story of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32)? The father didn't wait for his son to clean up his act before running to embrace him. Jesus died for sins like sexual immorality just as much as any other—it's all covered by His blood if we turn to Him in repentance. If you've been living this way, it's not too late to realign with God's path. Conviction from the Holy Spirit is a gift, not a punishment—it's His way of drawing you closer.\n\n### Practical Steps Forward\nSo, what now? Let's think practically and prayerfully about next steps, tailored to your commitment to each other:\n\n1. **Pray and Seek Forgiveness Together**: Start by confessing this to God as a couple. 1 John 1:9 promises, \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\" Invite the Holy Spirit to guide you.\n\n2. **Evaluate Your Relationship**: If you're truly committed, why not move toward marriage? Premarital counseling through your church can help you prepare biblically and practically. If marriage isn't on the horizon soon, consider separating your living arrangements to honor God and protect your purity. This might feel difficult—logistically and emotionally—but Jesus said in Matthew 19:29 that those who sacrifice for His sake will be blessed.\n\n3. **Set Boundaries for Purity**: Whether you pursue marriage or not, commit to abstinence until your wedding day. Surround yourselves with accountability—join a small group, find mentors, or use resources like books (e.g., \"The Meaning of Marriage\" by Timothy Keller) or apps for purity support.\n\n4. **Build a Supportive Community**: Don't navigate this alone. Talk to trusted friends or elders in your church who can pray with you and offer wisdom without judgment.\n\nUltimately, God's design for relationships isn't about rules to restrict us but about freedom and joy in His best for us. By choosing His way, you're investing in a foundation that can withstand life's storms.\n\nIf you'd like, we can pray together right now, or schedule a time to talk more. Father, I lift this couple to You. Thank You for their hearts seeking Your truth. Surround them with Your grace, convict where needed, and guide them into the abundant life You promise in Christ. Amen.\n\nWith love and prayers,  \nPastor [Your Name]",

The guidance strikes a solid balance of truth-telling and compassion, offering practical steps (confession, premarital counseling, possible separation, abstinence, accountability, and community support) that are feasible for many couples pursuing kingdom life. Minor areas for refinement include presenting cohabitation nuance (not all cohabitation is a sin in every situation), avoiding overstatement of sociological studies, ensuring precise quotation of Scripture (Matthew 19:29), and inviting deeper listening to the couple’s unique circumstances and timing. With those adjustments, the response would robustly support discipleship, protect the covenantal vision of marriage, and extend grace to those navigating real-life relationships."
