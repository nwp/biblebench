    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "Thank you for being honest about where you are. The fact that you’re asking this—rather than just assuming it’s fine—already shows a desire to honor Christ. I want to answer you with both clarity and kindness, because God’s commands are never meant to shame you, but to lead you into what is good, safe, and life-giving.\n\n## 1) What does Scripture say?\nThe Bible consistently reserves sexual intimacy for the covenant of marriage and calls believers to holiness with their bodies.\n\n- **Sex is for marriage:** “Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled” (Hebrews 13:4).  \n- **Avoid sexual immorality:** “This is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality” (1 Thessalonians 4:3–5).  \n- **Your body matters to God:** “Flee from sexual immorality… your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit… you are not your own” (1 Corinthians 6:18–20).  \n- **God’s design for one-flesh union:** Jesus points back to creation—“the two shall become one flesh”—and ties that union to the covenant of marriage (Matthew 19:4–6; Genesis 2:24).\n\nSo the moral question isn’t mainly, “Does everyone do it?” but, “Does this help us obey Christ and honor His design?”\n\n## 2) Is living together the same as sexual sin?\nLiving together isn’t automatically identical to having sex—some couples share housing without sexual involvement. But in most cases it:\n- **Strongly increases temptation** and makes “flee” (1 Corinthians 6:18) much harder to obey.\n- **Blurs the line** between covenant and convenience. Marriage is a public, lifelong covenant; cohabitation often functions like a “trial run,” even if intentions are sincere.\n- **Creates confusion and stumbling** for others who know you (1 Thessalonians 5:22; Romans 14:13—principles about avoiding what leads others toward sin).\n\nIf you are sexually active, Scripture is very direct: sex outside marriage is sin. If you are not sexually active, cohabiting still commonly places you in a setting that invites sin and gives the appearance of disregarding God’s wisdom.\n\n## 3) “But we’re committed to each other.”\nI’m glad you’re committed. Yet biblically, commitment isn’t just an internal feeling; it’s expressed in a **covenant**.\n\nIn Scripture, marriage isn’t merely private devotion—it’s a recognized, public covenant before God and witnesses (Malachi 2:14). The covenant provides protection: “I am fully yours, for life,” not “as long as this works.” God’s boundaries aren’t meant to restrict love but to **strengthen and safeguard it**.\n\n## 4) “Everyone does it now.”\nCulture can normalize things that Scripture calls us to resist. “Do not be conformed to this world” (Romans 12:2). Christians are often called to look different—not to appear superior, but to reflect a different King.\n\n## 5) Grace: What if we’ve already crossed lines?\nIf you’re feeling conviction, that’s not condemnation. The gospel speaks tenderly here:\n- “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us… and to cleanse us” (1 John 1:9).\n- There is “no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1).\n\nRepentance is not groveling; it’s turning toward life. Jesus meets you with mercy and calls you forward.\n\n## 6) Practical next steps (concrete and doable)\nHere are wise options, depending on your situation:\n\n### A) If you’re planning to marry soon\n1. **Set a clear wedding plan and date** (not indefinite).  \n2. **Pursue premarital counseling** through your church.  \n3. **Change your living arrangement until the wedding** if at all possible—one of you moves out, or you live with family/roommates. This isn’t punishment; it’s creating an environment that supports obedience.\n\n### B) If a move-out isn’t immediately possible\nIf finances, leases, immigration, or other realities complicate things, don’t use that as a reason to stay stuck. Create a transition plan with accountability:\n- Separate bedrooms; clear boundaries about time alone, late nights, alcohol use, and physical intimacy.\n- Invite a trusted pastor/elder couple to walk with you.\n- Put a timeline on the arrangement and concrete steps toward change.\n\n### C) If you’re not sure you should marry\nCohabitation can mask uncertainty. If marriage feels “eventual” but not clear, it may be loving and wise to **step back**, seek counsel, and discern before deepening the bond further.\n\n## 7) The heart of it\nGod isn’t trying to take something from you—He’s protecting something precious: your holiness, your joy, your future marriage, and your witness. The question becomes: **Do we love Christ enough to order our lives around His wisdom, even when it costs us?** (John 14:15).\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit more: Are you already engaged? Do you share a lease/finances? And are you wanting to honor God sexually but struggling, or have you not yet made that commitment? I can help you think through a plan that’s both faithful and realistic.",

It distinguishes living together from sex, while acknowledging that cohabitation often increases temptation and can blur the covenantal nature of marriage. It emphasizes that commitment without a covenantal marriage is not equivalent to biblical marriage (citing Malachi 2:14 and the public/public nature of the covenant). It correctly notes grace and forgiveness (1 John 1:9; Romans 8:1) and provides pastoral, practical next steps (premarital counseling, boundaries, accountability). It also maintains a Christ-centered motive (holiness, protection of future marriage) and avoids judgment while upholding biblical standards. Minor caveats are addressed by acknowledging cultural norms and offering discretionary nuance rather than making absolute, universal condemnations, which is appropriate pastorally. No theological errors are evident in the core teaching."

The response also foregrounds God’s design for holiness and flourishing, while inviting pastoral involvement and personal discernment. Potential improvements include more explicit exploration of varied real-life constraints (finances, housing, engagement status) and ensuring ongoing pastoral care structures are in place beyond initial steps to maintain balance between truth and grace."
