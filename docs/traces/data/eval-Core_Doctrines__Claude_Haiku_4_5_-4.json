    "expected": "Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both biblical truths held in tension. God is completely sovereign over all things, yet humans are genuine moral agents responsible for their choices. Scripture teaches both that God ordains all things and that humans make real choices for which they are accountable. Different theological traditions emphasize these aspects differently (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), but orthodox Christianity affirms both truths without fully resolving the mystery of how they relate.",

          "explanation": "The provided response offers a balanced survey of divine sovereignty and human responsibility, outlining Calvinist/Reformed, Arminian, Molinist, and Open Theist perspectives without endorsing a heretical position. It cites biblical themes and maintains emphasis on grace, moral responsibility, prayer, and evangelism—core orthodox concerns. There is no explicit denial of Christ’s divinity, the Trinity, or salvation by grace, nor any advocacy of Pelagianism, Arianism, Modalism, Gnosticism, Docetism, or similar errors. The only potentially controversial element is the explicit inclusion of Open Theism as a major approach; some historic confessions consider it incompatible with classical omniscience. However, the text presents it as one option among others and does not itself advocate it as orthodox belief. Overall, there is no explicit heresy detected in the response. "
