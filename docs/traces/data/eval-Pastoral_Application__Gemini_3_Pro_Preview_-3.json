    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "My dear friend,\n\nI am so deeply, deeply sorry. There are no words I can say that will take away the crushing weight in your chest right now. Before we look at theology or Scripture, I want to sit with you in the ashes of this grief. I want to weep with you, just as Scripture commands us to mourn with those who mourn.\n\nYou have asked a question that is torn from the very bottom of your soul, and you deserve an honest answer, not a spiritual cliché.\n\nWhen people say, “It was God’s will” or “Everything happens for a reason,” they are usually trying to make sense of the senseless. They often speak out of their own fear, trying to paste a simple label on a tragedy because the chaos such loss represents is terrifying. But in doing so, they have unintentionally painted a picture of God that looks like a monster.\n\nIf \"God's will\" means that God reached down, pushed a car off the road, and took your child because He needed another angel, or because He wanted to teach you a lesson, then I reject that theology, and I believe Scripture does too.\n\nHere is how we can walk through this together, holding onto both truth and grace.\n\n**1. Death is an Intruder, not a Blueprint**\nThe Bible is very clear that death is an enemy. In 1 Corinthians 15:26, Paul calls death \"the last enemy.\" God did not create the world to have car accidents, cancer, or funerals. These things entered the world through the fracture of sin and the brokenness of creation.\n\nWhen your child died, God was not sitting in heaven checking a box on a cold master plan. His heart was breaking. We see this most clearly in Jesus. When Jesus stood at the tomb of his friend Lazarus, even though He knew He was about to raise him, He did not say, \"Well, everything happens for a reason.\" Scripture says, \"Jesus wept\" (John 11:35). He felt the horror of death in his gut. He was angry at the pain death causes.\n\nGod’s \"will\" is not always a specific script of tragedy that He authors; rather, we live in a world where freedom, physics, and human error collide. God allows these natural laws to exist, but He does not delight in the death of the living (Ezekiel 33:11).\n\n**2. God’s Permission vs. God’s Desire**\nWe must distinguish between what God *permits* in His sovereignty and what God *desires* in His heart.\n\nGod is sovereign, meaning nothing happens outside of His knowledge or power. But Scripture teaches that God *does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone* (Lamentations 3:33). He permitted this accident in the mystery of a fallen world, but He did not commit it with malice. He is not a puppet master pulling strings of destruction; He is the Sustainer who holds you while the world crumbles.\n\n**3. Redeeming is Different than Causing**\nThe phrase \"Everything happens for a reason\" is not in the Bible. What *is* in the Bible is Romans 8:28: *\"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him...\"*\n\nNotice the difference. It does not say \"all things *are* good.\" Death is not good. The accident was not good. It does not say \"God caused all things.\" It says God *works in* all things.\n\nThis means that God is so powerful and so loving that He refuses to let this tragedy have the final word. He takes the jagged, terrible shards of this pain and promises to weave them, eventually, into a redemption we cannot yet see. But that does not mean He caused the accident just to teach you something. Your child was not a pawn in a cosmic lesson.\n\n**4. Permission to Lament**\nYou asked, \"How can a loving God will my child's death?\" The answer is that the loving God is arguably more grieved by the unnaturalness of death than you are. He hates it so much that He sent His own Son to die in order to destroy it.\n\nRight now, your task is not to defend God or figure out the \"reason.\" Your task is to lament. Read the Psalms—nearly a third of them are angry cries to God. Psalm 88 ends with the words, *\"Darkness is my closest friend.\"* God included that in the Bible so you would know that your anger, confusion, and darkness are allowed in His presence. You can scream at heaven. God is big enough to handle your grief.\n\n**Pastoral Counsel for the Days Ahead:**\n\n*   **Filter the Voices:** You have my permission to gently ignore those who offer platitudes. When they say, \"It's God's will,\" you can whisper to yourself, \"God is weeping with me.\"\n*   **Look to the Cross:** When you doubt God’s love because of your circumstances, look to the Cross. That is where God proved His love. He did not watch your child die from a distance; He knows what it is to lose a Son. He is the \"Man of Sorrows, acquainted with grief\" (Isaiah 53:3). He is walking this valley with you, not watching from above.\n*   **Hope, not Explanation:** We don't have a full explanation for why this accident happened physically or circumstantially. We walk by faith, not by sight. But our faith is not that \"this happened for a good reason.\" Our faith is that **death is not the end.** Because of Christ, there is a reunion. The separation is terrible, but it is temporary.\n\nMy friend, God is not the author of evil, and He is not the architect of your pain. He is the Redeemer of it. Lean into Him, even if it’s just to pound on His chest and weep. He has you.\n\nLet us pray for strength for just the next hour. That is all you need to handle right now.",
