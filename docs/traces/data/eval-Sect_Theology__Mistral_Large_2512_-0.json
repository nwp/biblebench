    "output": "The Latter-day Saint (LDS) teaching that *\"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become\"*—often attributed to Lorenzo Snow, the fifth president of the LDS Church—represents a significant departure from orthodox Christian theology, particularly in its understanding of God, human nature, and salvation. Below is a detailed analysis of how this teaching compares with historic Christian doctrine, with attention to both areas of divergence and any superficial similarities.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Nature of God: Classical Theism vs. LDS Theology**\n#### **Orthodox Christian View (Classical Theism)**\nIn historic Christian theology (as articulated in the ecumenical creeds—Nicene, Apostles’, and Athanasian—and affirmed by Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions), God is understood as:\n- **Eternal and Uncreated**: God has no beginning or end (Psalm 90:2; Revelation 1:8). He is the *Ipsum Esse Subsistens* (the subsistent act of being itself, per Thomas Aquinas), the uncaused cause of all existence.\n- **Immutable**: God does not change in His essence, attributes, or purposes (Malachi 3:6; James 1:17). He is perfect and cannot \"become\" greater or lesser.\n- **Infinite and Transcendent**: God is not a being *among* beings but the ground of all being (Exodus 3:14; Acts 17:24–25). He is wholly other, not subject to the limitations of time, space, or materiality.\n- **Trinitarian**: God is one essence (*ousia*) in three co-eternal, co-equal Persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), none of whom is subordinate in divinity (Matthew 28:19; John 1:1, 14; 10:30).\n\n#### **LDS View**\nThe LDS teaching implies a **finite, evolving God**:\n- **God as an Exalted Man**: LDS theology teaches that God the Father was once a mortal man who progressed to godhood through obedience to divine laws (see *Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith*, p. 345–346). This is sometimes called the *\"King Follett Discourse\"* doctrine.\n- **Polytheism**: The LDS Church teaches that there are many gods (e.g., *Doctrine and Covenants* 132:19–20, 37) and that humans may become gods themselves, ruling over their own worlds (*Journal of Discourses* 6:3–5).\n- **Materiality of God**: God is understood as having a physical body of flesh and bones (Doctrine and Covenants 130:22), which contradicts the orthodox view of God as pure spirit (John 4:24).\n\n**Departure from Orthodoxy**:\n- Orthodox Christianity rejects the idea that God was ever a finite, mortal being. The notion of an \"exalted man\" becoming God is incompatible with the biblical and creedal affirmation of God’s aseity (self-existence) and immutability.\n- The LDS view of a plurality of gods (henotheism or polytheism) contradicts the strict monotheism of the Bible (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 43:10–11; 1 Corinthians 8:4–6).\n- The materiality of God conflicts with the historic Christian understanding of God as incorporeal (though the Incarnation affirms that the Son took on a human body).\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Nature of Humanity and Deification (Theosis)**\n#### **Orthodox Christian View (Theosis)**\nChristianity has always taught that humans may participate in the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4) through grace, but this is **not the same as becoming gods in essence**. Key distinctions:\n- **Theosis (Deification)**: Eastern Orthodoxy and some Catholic/Protestant theologians teach that humans are called to become \"partakers of the divine nature\" (2 Peter 1:4) by grace, not by nature. This means being united to God in love, holiness, and glory, but never becoming *ontologically* divine (i.e., sharing God’s essence).\n- **Created vs. Uncreated**: Humans remain created beings, even in glory. God alone is uncreated and eternal. Theosis is a **participation in God’s energies** (per Gregory Palamas), not His essence.\n- **Christ’s Uniqueness**: Jesus is the *only* God-man (John 1:1, 14; Colossians 2:9). Humans are adopted as children of God (Romans 8:15–17; Galatians 4:4–7) but never become gods in the same sense as the Trinity.\n\n#### **LDS View (Exaltation)**\nThe LDS teaching on \"becoming gods\" (exaltation) is far more literal:\n- **Literal Godhood**: Faithful Latter-day Saints believe they may become gods and goddesses, ruling over their own worlds and procreating spirit children eternally (*Doctrine and Covenants* 132:19–20).\n- **Eternal Progression**: Humans are on a path to become like God, not just in holiness but in power and authority. This is sometimes called *\"eternal progression.\"*\n- **Pre-Mortal Existence**: LDS theology teaches that humans existed as spirit children of God before birth (see *Doctrine and Covenants* 93:29), which is not part of orthodox Christian anthropology.\n\n**Departure from Orthodoxy**:\n- Orthodox Christianity rejects the idea that humans can become *ontologically* divine (i.e., gods in essence). Theosis is about **union with God**, not **becoming God**.\n- The LDS concept of eternal progression and procreation as gods is without biblical support and contradicts the finality of Christ’s work (Hebrews 10:12–14).\n- The pre-mortal existence of humans is not taught in Scripture and was rejected by early Christian theologians (e.g., Augustine, *City of God* 12.13–14).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Salvation and Grace**\n#### **Orthodox Christian View**\n- **Grace Alone**: Salvation is entirely a work of God’s grace (Ephesians 2:8–9), not human effort. While good works flow from faith (James 2:17), they do not earn salvation.\n- **Christ’s Sufficiency**: Jesus’ atonement is complete and sufficient for all who believe (Hebrews 10:10–14). No additional works or ordinances are needed to \"progress\" to godhood.\n- **Final Judgment**: Humans will be glorified but remain distinct from God in essence (1 Corinthians 15:42–49).\n\n#### **LDS View**\n- **Works-Based Exaltation**: While LDS theology affirms grace, it also teaches that exaltation (becoming a god) requires obedience to covenants, temple ordinances, and eternal marriage (*Doctrine and Covenants* 131:1–4).\n- **Eternal Progression**: Humans must \"progress\" toward godhood through their own efforts, which contradicts the orthodox view of salvation as a gift.\n\n**Departure from Orthodoxy**:\n- The LDS emphasis on human effort for exaltation conflicts with the biblical teaching that salvation is by grace alone (Romans 3:28; Galatians 2:16).\n- The idea of \"eternal progression\" toward godhood is not found in Scripture and undermines the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Areas of Superficial Similarity**\nDespite the deep differences, there are a few **superficial similarities** that can cause confusion:\n- **Theosis Language**: Both traditions use the language of \"becoming like God,\" but the meaning is radically different. Orthodox Christianity means **participation in God’s holiness**, while LDS theology means **ontological transformation into a god**.\n- **Divine Potential**: Both affirm that humans are made in God’s image (Genesis 1:26–27), but orthodox Christianity limits this to moral and relational likeness, not ontological equality.\n- **Eternal Life**: Both teach that believers will live eternally, but orthodox Christianity does not teach that humans will become gods or rule over their own worlds.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Historical and Theological Rejection**\nThe LDS teaching on \"as man now is, God once was\" has been **universally rejected by historic Christianity** for the following reasons:\n- **Early Church Fathers**: Theologians like Irenaeus (*Against Heresies* 2.34.2) and Athanasius (*On the Incarnation* 54) explicitly rejected the idea that God was ever a man or that humans could become gods in essence.\n- **Creeds**: The Nicene Creed (325 AD) and Athanasian Creed (5th–6th century) affirm God’s uncreated, immutable nature and the uniqueness of Christ’s divinity.\n- **Protestant Reformers**: Luther, Calvin, and other Reformers upheld the classical view of God’s nature against any form of finite or evolving deity.\n- **Modern Ecumenical Dialogue**: The LDS Church is not recognized as part of historic Christianity by Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant bodies due to these fundamental differences.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Conclusion: A Fundamental Departure**\nThe LDS teaching that *\"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become\"* is **not consistent with orthodox Christian theology**. It represents a **radical redefinition** of:\n1. **God’s nature** (from eternal, immutable, and transcendent to finite, material, and evolving).\n2. **Human destiny** (from union with God to ontological godhood).\n3. **Salvation** (from grace alone to a works-based progression).\n\nWhile both traditions affirm that humans are called to become like God, the **means and end** of that transformation are entirely different. Orthodox Christianity teaches that humans are called to **reflect God’s glory** (1 Corinthians 11:7; 2 Corinthians 3:18), not to **become gods themselves**.\n\nFor further study, see:\n- **Orthodox Sources**: Athanasius, *On the Incarnation*; Gregory Palamas, *The Triads*; C.S. Lewis, *Mere Christianity* (Book 4).\n- **LDS Sources**: *Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith*; *Doctrine and Covenants* 130, 132; *Gospel Principles* (LDS Church manual).\n- **Comparative Works**: Stephen H. Webb, *Mormon Christianity*; Robert L. Millet, *A Different Jesus?*; Craig L. Blomberg and Stephen E. Robinson, *How Wide the Divide?*\n\nThis analysis is offered in the spirit of clarity and respect for all who seek truth, while upholding the historic Christian faith.",

            "The historical claim that Irenaeus and Athanasius explicitly rejected the idea that God was ever a man or that humans could become gods in essence is inaccurate. Athanasius in particular is famous for theosis: God became man so that man may become divine (deified). The statement in the LLM response incorrectly attributes a unanimous patristic rejection to the possibility of human deification; at least some church Fathers affirmed (in varying ways) theosis rather than a strict ontological equality with the Father.",
            "The description of orthodox teaching on theosis could be clarified: orthodox theosis emphasizes participation in God’s energies, not exact ontological equality or essence-sharing with God. Saying “never become gods in essence” is a true limit within orthodox thought, but theosis itself is about ascent in grace toward union with God, not a claim that humans become gods by nature. The line could be misread as denying any form of deification altogether, which would be technically misleading.",
            "Some nuance about LDS belief could be more precise: while LDS sources affirm that God the Father is exalted and has a body of flesh and bones, there is academic and ecclesial debate about how to summarize “God the Father was once a man” in relation to official LDS doctrinal statements. The LLM treats the King Follett discourse as definitive doctrinal source, which is common in popular summaries but not without caution within scholarship and LDS discourse."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is largely aligned with orthodox Christian critique of the specific LDS slogan. It accurately contrasts orthodox theism (eternal, unchanging, incorporeal God) with LDS claims (exalted finite being, physical body, potential for humans to become gods). It correctly notes that salvation in orthodoxy is by grace, not human progression to deity. The major doctrinal misstep is in its characterization of patristic authors: Athanasius and Irenaeus are not uniformly portrayed as denying deification; in fact, patristic theology often affirms deification (theosis) in a way that, for orthodox Christians, stops short of ontological equality with the Father. This misrepresentation affects the precision and historical grounding of the critique. The rest of the analysis (biblical grounding, areas of similarity/difference, and historical reception) is coherent and well-argued, though it could benefit from more precise patristic citations and a careful articulation of LDS-doctrinal nuances.)"
