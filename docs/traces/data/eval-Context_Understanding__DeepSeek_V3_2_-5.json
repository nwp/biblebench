          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer accurately reflects the classic purpose of the book of Revelation: to encourage persecuted Christians by revealing God’s ultimate victory and the return of Christ. This aligns with Scripture (e.g., Revelation 1:1 about the revelation given to show servants what must soon take place, and the overarching eschatological hope of Christ’s return) and with historic Christian orthodoxy. The response is concise and focuses on the core thrust of Revelation’s message. It could be complemented by noting other aspects (e.g., exhortations to perseverance, worship, warnings against compromise), but as a succinct statement of purpose it remains faithful to biblical teaching."
