    "expected": "Calvinism and Arminianism differ primarily on sovereignty and free will. Calvinists emphasize God's unconditional election, where God chooses who will be saved based solely on His will (TULIP: Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance of saints). Arminians emphasize that God's election is based on foreknowledge of who will freely choose faith, that Christ's atonement is unlimited, that grace can be resisted, and that believers can potentially lose salvation. Both affirm salvation by grace through faith and God's sovereignty, but differ on how divine sovereignty relates to human choice. Both views have been held by orthodox Christians throughout church history.",

            "Calvinist section omits an explicit mention of Limited Atonement (one of the classic tulip points) and instead only references sovereignty, predestination, total depravity, irresistible grace, and perseverance. The limited atonement element is conveyed only in the comparison table, not in the Calvinist subsection itself.",

            "In the table, Arminian entry for 'Is Christ's atonement universal in scope?' says 'Universal, though not all appropriate it' which is awkward/garbled and could confuse readers. A clearer phrasing would say something like 'universal in scope; not all will apply it.'",
            "The line 'Resistible grace: humans can accept or reject God's offer' is accurate for Arminians, but the corresponding Calvinist claim ('No, for the elect') could be nuanced: mainstream Calvinism teaches that grace is irresistible for the elect but not universally irresistible; stating it as a blanket 'No (for the elect)' is acceptable but could be misread as denying any possibility of resistance outside the elect, which is a nuanced distinction.",

          "rationale": "The response is largely accurate and captures major doctrinal differences (sovereignty, grace, predestination, perseverance, prevenient/resistible grace). It aligns well with historic positions and common summaries of Calvinism and Arminianism, and it notes practical implications and historical context. However, it would be stronger with explicit invocation of Limited Atonement in the Calvinist section, clearer wording in the contested points (especially around universal atonement and the nature of grace), and a fully coherent central tension statement. The missing explicit scriptural grounding is a common limitation in such summaries; the content is biblically aligned even if not cited directly."

There is no clear favoring of one denomination over the other.
