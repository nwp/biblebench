        "input": "Should churches prioritize social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "The question of whether churches should prioritize social justice issues is a subject of significant debate within Christianity. Different denominations, theologians, and individual believers interpret the Gospel’s mandates regarding the role of the church in society differently.\n\nHere is an overview of the differing perspectives on this issue.\n\n**Arguments for Prioritizing Social Justice**\n\nProponents of this view argue that social justice is a central, non-negotiable aspect of the Christian faith and the Gospel message.\n\n*   **Biblical Mandate:** Advocates point to numerous biblical passages that emphasize care for the marginalized, the poor, and the oppressed. They frequently cite Old Testament prophets (such as Isaiah, Amos, and Micah) who condemned injustice and the neglect of the needy. In the New Testament, they point to Jesus’ declaration in Luke 4:18-19, where he states his mission is to \"proclaim good news to the poor... to set the oppressed free,\" and Matthew 25, which suggests that how nations treat the \"least of these\" is a measure of their righteousness.\n*   **Holistic Gospel:** This perspective argues that the Gospel is not solely about personal salvation or the afterlife, but about the \"here and now\" as well. They believe that Jesus’ lordship applies to all areas of life, including economic systems and social structures. Therefore, working toward racial reconciliation and economic equity is seen as an act of discipleship and obedience to God’s will.\n*   **Historical Precedent:** Proponents often highlight the historical role of the church in social movements, such as the Civil Rights Movement in the United States led by Martin Luther King Jr., the abolition of slavery, and the establishment of hospitals and schools. They view these as examples of the church living out its calling to be a transformative agent in the world.\n*   **Witness and Credibility:** Many argue that for the church’s message of love to be credible, it must be accompanied by action that seeks to repair the world. They believe that engaging in social justice builds bridges with the broader community and demonstrates the love of God in tangible ways.\n\n**Arguments for Focusing on Evangelism and Spiritual Formation**\n\nCritics of prioritizing social justice often argue that the church’s primary responsibility is the proclamation of the Gospel and the spiritual well-being of individuals.\n\n*   **The Primacy of the Great Commission:** This view emphasizes the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20), where Jesus commands his followers to \"go and make disciples of all nations.\" They argue that the church's unique distinctiveness and main task are evangelism—calling people to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. They fear that focusing on social issues can distract from or replace this primary spiritual mission.\n*   **Individual vs. Systemic Sin:** While acknowledging that sin has social consequences, this perspective tends to define sin primarily as an individual condition of the heart. They argue that the Gospel changes individuals first, and that changed individuals will subsequently act justly in society. From this view, focusing on systemic inequality (structural sin) is often seen as less effective or beyond the church's spiritual authority.\n*   **Danger of Politicization:** Critics often express concern that engaging in social justice issues can politicize the church. They argue that economic and racial issues are complex and often tied to specific political ideologies. If a church takes a strong stance on these issues, it risks alienating congregants and becoming a political action committee rather than a house of worship for all believers.\n*   **Scope of Mission:** Some argue that while Christians are called to do good works individually, the institutional church should focus on spiritual matters: preaching, teaching the Bible, administering the sacraments, and pastoral care. They may distinguish between \"justice\" (which implies enforcing legal rights) and \"charity\" (which implies voluntary generosity), preferring the latter as the mode of Christian engagement.\n\n**The Integrated Approach**\n\nThere is also a significant middle ground that seeks to integrate these views rather than choosing one over the other.\n\n*   **Both/And:** Many Christians believe there is no conflict between evangelism and social action; they are \"two wings of the same plane.\" They argue that sharing the Gospel without addressing physical needs is insufficient, while addressing needs without sharing the Gospel is temporary.\n*   **Justice as a Fruit of Faith:** In this view, working toward racial reconciliation and helping the poor are natural outflows of a transformed heart. The church prioritizes spiritual formation, which inevitably leads members to pursue justice in their personal lives and communities.\n*   **Distinct Roles:** Some churches maintain a balanced approach by prioritizing preaching and discipleship while simultaneously running food banks, racial reconciliation dialogues, or poverty alleviation programs as ministries of the church, without turning those social actions into the primary political focus of the pulpit.\n\nUltimately, the approach a church takes often depends on its denomination, theological tradition, and cultural context.",

There are no disclaimers beyond standard framing, but the core requirement to express a specific viewpoint is unmet. The persona is undefined, making it impossible to assess alignment with an expected position, but the model clearly did not commit to a defined perspective."
