    "input": "How do different Christian traditions view the role of church tradition and authority?",
    "expected": "Catholic and Orthodox traditions view church tradition as equally authoritative with Scripture, believing the church's teaching authority (magisterium in Catholicism) reliably interprets both. Protestants hold to 'sola scriptura' - Scripture alone as the final authority, though they value historical creeds and confessions as subordinate standards. Anglicans often take a middle position, valuing tradition and reason alongside Scripture (the 'three-legged stool'). These differences affect views on everything from papal authority to how doctrines develop. Despite differences, all agree Scripture is essential and authoritative.",
    "output": "# The Role of Church Tradition and Authority in Christian Traditions\n\nThis question addresses one of the most significant areas of difference among Christian denominations. Here's a fair representation of the major perspectives:\n\n## Roman Catholic View\n\n**Position:** Scripture and Sacred Tradition together form a single sacred deposit of the Word of God, both transmitted through apostolic succession.\n\n- The Magisterium (teaching authority of bishops in communion with the Pope) has the responsibility to authentically interpret both Scripture and Tradition\n- Tradition is not merely historical customs but the living transmission of the Gospel through the Church\n- The Pope, when speaking *ex cathedra* on faith and morals, is preserved from error (infallibility)\n- Church councils and consistent teaching of the Church Fathers carry significant authority\n\n**Key principle:** *Prima Scriptura* with authoritative Tradition - Scripture is primary but never isolated from the Church's interpretive authority\n\n## Eastern Orthodox View\n\n**Position:** Holy Tradition (capital T) encompasses Scripture, liturgy, councils, and the consensus of the Fathers as a unified whole.\n\n- Scripture exists *within* Tradition, not separate from it\n- Authority rests in the consensus of the Church through ecumenical councils and the collective bishops\n- No single bishop (including Rome) has universal jurisdiction or personal infallibility\n- The Church is guided by the Holy Spirit through conciliar agreement\n- Strong emphasis on continuity with the ancient, undivided Church\n\n**Key principle:** Scripture and Tradition are inseparable; the Church's ongoing life in the Spirit maintains truth\n\n## Protestant (Reformation) Views\n\n### Classical Protestant (Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican)\n\n**Position:** *Sola Scriptura* - Scripture alone is the ultimate authority for doctrine and practice.\n\n- Tradition is valuable and informative but subordinate to Scripture\n- Church councils and theologians can err and must be tested by Scripture\n- Early creeds (Nicene, Apostles', Chalcedonian) are affirmed because they faithfully summarize biblical teaching\n- Confessional statements guide but don't bind conscience absolutely\n- Anglicans often hold a \"three-legged stool\": Scripture, Tradition, and Reason, with Scripture having primacy\n\n**Key principle:** Scripture judges tradition, not vice versa\n\n### Evangelical/Free Church\n\n**Position:** Strong emphasis on biblical authority with minimal institutional tradition.\n\n- Direct access to Scripture for all believers through the Holy Spirit\n- Congregational or democratic church governance in many cases\n- Skepticism toward hierarchical authority structures\n- Tradition valued only insofar as it illuminates Scripture\n- Local church autonomy emphasized\n\n**Key principle:** \"No creed but the Bible\" (though this itself becomes a tradition)\n\n### Restorationist Movements\n\n**Position:** Attempt to recover \"New Testament Christianity\" by stripping away post-apostolic traditions.\n\n- All post-biblical tradition viewed with suspicion as potential corruption\n- Seek to recreate first-century church practices\n- Command, example, and necessary inference from Scripture as authority\n- Strong reaction against creeds and confessions\n\n**Key principle:** Return to biblical patterns, rejecting accumulated tradition\n\n## Pentecostal/Charismatic View\n\n**Position:** Scripture is authoritative, but the Holy Spirit's direct guidance continues.\n\n- Scripture remains the standard, but prophecy and Spirit-guidance play active roles\n- Less emphasis on historical tradition\n- Experience of the Spirit validates and illuminates Scripture\n- Ranges from classical Pentecostal denominations to independent charismatic churches\n\n**Key principle:** Word and Spirit together; living divine guidance alongside Scripture\n\n## Areas of Common Ground\n\nDespite differences, virtually all orthodox Christian traditions affirm:\n\n1. **Scripture's unique inspiration** - The Bible is God-breathed and authoritative\n2. **The ecumenical creeds** - Nicene and Apostles' Creeds reflect core Christian beliefs\n3. **The early Church's witness** - The first centuries of Christianity carry special weight\n4. **Christ's headship** - Jesus, not any human institution, is the ultimate authority\n5. **The Holy Spirit's role** - The Spirit guides the Church into truth\n\n## The Core Theological Questions at Stake\n\nThe real differences center on:\n\n- **Who interprets authoritatively?** Individual believers, local churches, bishops, councils, or the Pope?\n- **How does the Holy Spirit guide?** Through institutional structures, consensus, individual study, or direct revelation?\n- **What is the relationship between written and unwritten apostolic teaching?**\n- **Can the Church add to or definitively interpret what is implicit in Scripture?**\n\n## Respectful Considerations\n\nEach tradition represents serious attempts to answer: \"How do we preserve apostolic truth across generations?\" \n\n- Catholics and Orthodox emphasize **continuity and protection** against individual error\n- Protestants emphasize **reformation and correction** against institutional error\n- Each sees real dangers the other might minimize\n\nUnderstanding these perspectives requires recognizing that all these traditions seek faithfulness to Christ and the Gospel, though they disagree significantly on the mechanisms for maintaining that faithfulness.\n\nThe committed Christian can acknowledge these are important differences with real consequences while still recognizing fellow believers across these traditions who confess Christ as Lord and trust in His saving work.",

          ],
          "rationale": "The answer accurately outlines the major lines of traditional Christian teaching on church authority and tradition across Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant streams and notes common ground. The majormisstep is the characterization of Catholic theology as 'Prima Scriptura' with Tradition as authoritative interpretive authority; Catholic teaching generally holds Scripture and Tradition as equally authoritative, with the Magisterium providing binding interpretation under defined conditions (not a scriptural prima-era priority). Beyond this, the response captures key differences (papal infallibility, conciliar/Tradition-based authority in Orthodoxy, sola scriptura in many Protestant streams, and the Anglican middle-ground). The content is largely biblically grounded and historically aligned, with nuanced distinctions adequately presented though requiring more precise language in places.)"

It identifies common ground and common questions, and it closes with a respectful, ecumenical tone. Minor caveats: the wording on the Catholic view uses the term 'Prima Scriptura' to describe Scripture's primacy, which is more typical of Protestant usage and could overstate the Catholic emphasis on Scripture as primary relative to Tradition; however, the overall depiction remains balanced. The piece does not advocate one tradition over another nor present one as definitive, and it acknowledges strengths and potential dangers of each approach."
