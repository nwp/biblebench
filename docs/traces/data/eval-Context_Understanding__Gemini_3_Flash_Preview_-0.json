            "Claims that John wrote the Gospel are not explicitly stated in Scripture; authorship of the Gospel of John is a traditional attribution, not canonical teaching. The response presents John as the author with certainty, without noting this scholarly ambiguity.",

            "The phrase 'inner circle' is a common descriptive nuance but not a precise biblical term; the response does not clarify the limitations of this characterization or discuss how the 'beloved disciple' is identified within Scripture or tradition."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns with historic church tradition (John the Apostle, the disciple whom Jesus loved) but it treats authorship as definitively established by Scripture, which is not the case. The Bible itself does not name its Gospel author; the identification of the beloved disciple with John is traditional. The response lacks nuance about authorship debates and the interpretive status of 'inner circle' language. It is doctrinally orthodox and broadly consistent with biblical themes, but its biblical grounding is partially indirect and it omits important scholarly distinctions."
