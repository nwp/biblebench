    "expected": "John the Apostle, one of Jesus' twelve disciples, known as 'the disciple whom Jesus loved'",
    "output": "# The Authorship of the Gospel of John\n\n## The Traditional View\n\nThe overwhelming consensus of the early church tradition holds that the Gospel of John was written by **John the son of Zebedee**, one of the twelve disciples who was among the closest companions of Jesus during his ministry. This view is attested by multiple early church fathers, including Irenaeus (who reportedly learned from Polycarp, a disciple of John), Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria. The traditional understanding identifies John as the \"Beloved Disciple\" mentioned in the Gospel, the witness to events that other disciples did not see, and the one who recorded testimony he had personally witnessed.\n\n## The Author's Relationship to Jesus\n\nAccording to the Gospel itself and early Christian tradition, John held a uniquely intimate relationship with Jesus. He was among the first disciples called (along with his brother James), was present at transformative moments such as the Transfiguration and the raising of Jairus's daughter, and was specifically entrusted with the care of Mary at the crucifixion. John was one of the three disciples—along with Peter and James—whom Jesus chose to accompany him to the Garden of Gethsemane during his hour of greatest anguish. This proximity made John both a witness to and participant in the central events of Jesus's ministry, death, and resurrection.\n\n## Scholarly Perspectives\n\nWhile the traditional view remains the majority position among scholars and within the church, some biblical researchers have raised alternative theories. A minority of scholars, based on literary analysis and historical-critical methods, have suggested that the author may have been a different John, perhaps \"John of Patmos\" who wrote Revelation, or that the Gospel represents a community tradition developed over time rather than a single eyewitness account. However, most scholars—including many using critical methods—continue to support the traditional identification of John son of Zebedee as the author, noting the Gospel's apparent eyewitness details and its distinctive theology. The question of whether John was the literal \"Beloved Disciple\" or whether this was a separate figure remains a matter of scholarly discussion, though most interpreters identify them as the same person.# The Authorship of the Gospel of John\n\n## The Traditional View\n\nThe overwhelming consensus of the early church tradition holds that the Gospel of John was written by **John the son of Zebedee**, one of the twelve disciples who was among the closest companions of Jesus during his ministry.

            "The claim that John was one of the three disciples who accompanied Jesus to the Garden of Gethsemane is not explicit in the Gospel of John (the Garden scene is described in the Synoptic Gospels as involving Peter, James, and John).",
            "The statement that “most scholars… continue to support the traditional identification” of John the Apostle as the author is debatable; many modern critical scholars see the Gospel as the product of a Johannine community or as authored by a figure such as John the Evangelist but not definitively by the Apostle John alone. The traditional view is strongly supported in early church tradition but not universally held by contemporary scholarship.",

          "rationale": "The answer correctly identifies the traditional claim (John the Apostle, “Beloved Disciple,” close relationship to Jesus) and notes the existence of scholarly debate (Johannine community vs. single author, potential link to Revelation’s John). However, it asserts that John accompanied Jesus to the Garden of Gethsemane (not explicit in John’s Gospel) and it claims that “most scholars” defend the traditional identification, which overstates current consensus among many modern scholars. It also includes a duplicated, self-referential block of text, which is a presentation issue rather than a factual claim. Overall, the response is largely on-topic and includes relevant nuance about competing theories, but contains a factual inaccuracy and a stylistic problem that affect precision."
