            "Authorship of the Gospel of John is traditionally attributed to the Apostle John, but the Gospel itself does not name its author; many scholars view the authorship as debated (possibly a Johannine community or an unnamed author) rather than definitively John the Apostle. The answer should acknowledge this scholarly debate and present the traditional view as one option among others."

          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies John the Apostle (son of Zebedee) as the traditional author and accurately describes his relationship to Jesus (the disciple whom Jesus loved) and key events (Last Supper, crucifixion, care for Mary). However, it presents the authorship as an established fact rather than a traditional view with acknowledged scholarly debate. This omission reduces nuance and could mislead readers about the certainty of authorship. The content otherwise aligns with mainstream orthodox teaching and biblical grounding."
