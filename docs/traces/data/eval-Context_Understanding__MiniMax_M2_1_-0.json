    "output": "# The Authorship of the Gospel of John\n\n## The Traditional and Majority View\n\nThe Gospel of John has traditionally been attributed to **John the son of Zebedee**, one of the twelve disciples of Jesus. This view has been held by the majority of Christians throughout history and continues to be the predominant position in traditional Christianity. The Gospel itself does not explicitly name its author, but early church tradition, beginning with figures such as Irenaeus (c. 130-202 AD), consistently identified John the apostle as the author.\n\n## John the Disciple's Relationship to Jesus\n\nJohn held a particularly close relationship with Jesus, which is reflected throughout the Gospel. He is often identified as \"**the disciple whom Jesus loved**\" (John 13:23, 19:26, 20:2, 21:7, 21:20), suggesting an intimate friendship with the Lord. John was part of Jesus' inner circle of three disciples—along with Peter and James—who were present at transformative moments such as the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-2) and the Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (Mark 14:33). At the crucifixion, John was uniquely present at the foot of the cross, where Jesus entrusted him with the care of his mother Mary (John 19:26-27). John was also among the first to arrive at the empty tomb on Easter morning (John 20:2-8) and was present when the resurrected Jesus appeared to the disciples in Galilee (John 21:1-14).\n\n## Scholarly Perspectives\n\nWhile the traditional view remains dominant, some scholars have proposed alternative theories regarding authorship. These include the possibility that the Gospel was written by a \"Johannine community\" over time rather than by a single individual, or that the author was a different John—such as John of Patmos, associated with the Book of Revelation—rather than the son of Zebedee. The majority of scholars, however, continue to accept that the Gospel draws upon the testimony of an eyewitness to Jesus' ministry, traditionally identified as John the apostle.# The Authorship of the Gospel of John\n\n## The Traditional and Majority View\n\nThe Gospel of John has traditionally been attributed to **John the son of Zebedee**, one of the twelve disciples of Jesus.

            "Possible overstatement of scholarly consensus: while many scholars identify John as the author or a key eyewitness source, the precise authorship of the Gospel of John remains debated (some propose a Johannine community or another John), so framing it as a broad 'majority' view can be overstated.",
            "Note: The Transfiguration is described in the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew 17:1-2; Mark 9:2-8; Luke 9:28-36); John’s Gospel does not retell the Transfiguration narrative. The response uses the event to illustrate the 'inner circle' concept, which is accurate in the broader tradition but could mislead readers into thinking John’s Gospel itself recounts that event."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer correctly summarizes the traditional attribution of the Gospel of John to John the Apostle and identifies the beloved disciple as Jesus’ close companion. It also accurately reflects the ongoing scholarly debate by mentioning alternative theories (Johannine community, other John figures) and notes that the Gospel draws on eyewitness testimony. The response appropriately emphasizes traditional attribution while signaling scholarly uncertainty. Minor caveats include a potential overstatement of consensus in modern scholarship and the fact that the Transfiguration narrative appears in the Synoptic Gospels, not in John, which could need clarification for precision."
