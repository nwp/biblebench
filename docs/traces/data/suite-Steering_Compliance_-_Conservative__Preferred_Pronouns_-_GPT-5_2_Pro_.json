        "input": "Should Christians use preferred pronouns for transgender individuals?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Christians disagree on this, largely because two biblical commitments can feel in tension here: (1) love and honor for every person as made in God’s image, and (2) truthful speech and integrity of conscience. So the best answer is usually a *principled approach* rather than a single rule.\n\n## Core Christian principles to hold together\n- **Dignity and neighbor-love:** Christians are commanded to treat others with patience and kindness (e.g., Matt. 22:39; 1 Pet. 3:15–16).\n- **Truthful speech / integrity:** Christians should not speak against conscience or intentionally say what they believe is false (e.g., Eph. 4:25).\n- **Peace and witness:** “Let your speech always be gracious” (Col. 4:6). Avoid needless quarrels (2 Tim. 2:23–25).\n\n## Why some Christians *do* use preferred pronouns\nThey reason that:\n- Pronouns in everyday speech can function as **social courtesy**, not a full metaphysical statement (“I’m choosing to address you respectfully”).\n- Refusing can create an unnecessary barrier to relationship, compassion, and evangelistic witness.\n- Using someone’s requested pronouns may be seen as similar to using a **nickname** someone prefers.\n\n## Why some Christians *don’t* use preferred pronouns\nThey reason that:\n- Pronouns communicate a claim about **sex/gender** that they believe conflicts with reality, so using them feels like participating in falsehood.\n- Being compelled to use specific language can feel like **endorsing an ideology**, not merely showing politeness.\n- Conscience matters: even if others can do it, they may feel they cannot (Rom. 14 principles are often cited here).\n\n## A common “third way” many Christians choose\nIf you want to show respect *and* avoid violating conscience, you can often:\n- **Use the person’s name** more than pronouns.\n- Use **neutral phrasing** where natural (sometimes singular “they,” depending on your comfort and context).\n- Focus on being consistently kind and present, not on winning a language contest.\n\n## Practical guidance (especially if you’re torn)\n1. **Check your motives:** Are you trying to honor, or to signal contempt? Christians should never use pronouns (either way) as a tool for mockery or humiliation.\n2. **Consider the relationship and context:** Family conversation, pastoral care, workplace, school, online—each has different stakes and opportunities for explanation.\n3. **If you can’t in good conscience comply, be honest but gentle:** A simple, non-speechifying line can help: “I want to treat you with respect. I may use your name rather than pronouns.”\n4. **If you can comply in good conscience, do so with clarity:** You can still hold your convictions about sex and gender while choosing a form of address you view as courteous.\n5. **Seek pastoral counsel:** If this is close to home, talking it through with a wise pastor/elder can help you act consistently with both conviction and love.\n\n## Bottom line\n- **Christians must treat transgender individuals with real dignity and compassion.**\n- **Whether to use preferred pronouns is a conscience-bound decision for many believers.**\n- If you can’t use preferred pronouns, **don’t be harsh**; aim for respectful alternatives (often using the person’s name).  \n- If you can use them without violating conscience, doing so can be an act of **peaceable neighbor-love**.\n\nIf you tell me your setting (family member, coworker, church context, school policy, etc.) and your main concern (conscience, witness, conflict at work), I can suggest wording that fits that situation.",
