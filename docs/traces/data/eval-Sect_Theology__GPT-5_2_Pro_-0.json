    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "The saying—often associated with Lorenzo Snow in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS)—captures two closely linked LDS teachings: (1) God the Father was once as we are and progressed to godhood, and (2) human beings may likewise be “exalted” to become as God is. Measured against **orthodox (Nicene/Chalcedonian) Christian theology**, the statement is **not consistent**, though one part has a **surface-level resemblance** to an orthodox theme (theosis/deification) that must be carefully distinguished.\n\n## 1) “As man now is, God once was”\n### LDS meaning (in broad outline)\nIn standard LDS theology, God the Father is understood as an exalted man—embodied, and having attained godhood. This implies God’s divine status is, in some sense, the result of progression.\n\n### Orthodox Christian teaching\nOrthodox Christianity (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and classical Protestant theology in continuity with the early creeds) insists on a sharp **Creator–creature distinction**:\n\n- God is **uncreated**, eternal, and the source of all that exists (John 1:1–3; Psalm 90:2).\n- God does not “become God.” He **is** God timelessly and necessarily, not by advancement.\n- God is not one instance of a species (“gods”) but the one true God (Deut 6:4).\n\nThis is crystallized in Nicene language: the Son is “**begotten, not made** … **of one being** with the Father,” reflecting the wider conviction that God is not a being who came to be divine, but the eternal divine reality.\n\n**Therefore:** the claim “God once was as man now is” departs from orthodox Christianity because it implies God’s deity is not eternal and unoriginated, and it weakens (or redefines) the Creator–creature boundary that orthodox theology treats as fundamental.\n\n## 2) “As God now is, man may become”\n### Where there is real overlap in vocabulary\nOrthodox Christianity does teach a profound transformation of human beings by grace. Scripture speaks of:\n- being made “**partakers of the divine nature**” (2 Peter 1:4),\n- being conformed to Christ (Romans 8:29),\n- seeing God and being like Him (1 John 3:2),\n- becoming God’s children by adoption (Galatians 4:4–7).\n\nEastern Christianity especially uses the term **theosis** (“deification”). Some Church Fathers even used striking language such as Athanasius’s summary: “God became man that man might become god.”\n\n### The crucial orthodox qualification\nIn orthodox Christian theology, “becoming god” is **never** understood as becoming God **by nature** (i.e., becoming a separate deity, or becoming what God is in His essence). Instead:\n\n- Humans remain **creatures** forever.\n- Deification is **by grace**, participation, and communion with God—not an ontological promotion into the divine essence.\n- The result is union with God, holiness, immortality, and glorification **in Christ**, not independent godhood.\n\nEastern Orthodox theology often expresses this as participation in God’s **energies** (His life and actions) while never crossing into God’s **essence** (what God is in Himself). Western theology similarly guards the point via doctrines of **adoption**, **sanctification**, and **glorification**, not apotheosis into deity.\n\n### LDS meaning (again, broadly)\nIn LDS thought, exaltation is typically more expansive: humans may become like God in a way that can include attaining godhood (sometimes described in terms of becoming gods, eternal increase, etc.). That goes beyond orthodox theosis.\n\n**Therefore:** the second half of the couplet has a **verbal similarity** to Christian talk of deification, but it **diverges in content**. Orthodox Christianity affirms transformation into God’s likeness and participation in divine life, while denying that humans can become God in the same way God is God.\n\n## Bottom line\n- **Not consistent with orthodox Christian theology overall.**\n- The first clause (“God once was man”) directly contradicts orthodox commitments to God’s eternal, uncreated, unchanging deity and the Creator–creature distinction.\n- The second clause (“man may become as God is”) resembles orthodox themes of glorification/theosis **only at the level of phrasing**; orthodox Christianity means “godlike by grace and communion,” not “gods by nature” or an ascent to the same kind of deity as the Father.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also compare this statement specifically with (a) Eastern Orthodox theosis, (b) Catholic teaching on grace and glory, and (c) classical Protestant views of sanctification and glorification, to show exactly where each tradition would draw the line.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer accurately assesses the two-part statement against orthodox Christian theology. Key points are correctly noted: \n- The first clause, “As man now is, God once was,” contradicts the orthodox Creator–creature distinction and the doctrine of God’s eternal, uncreated nature. The response correctly cites the unchanging, eternal nature of God and the Nicene emphasis that God is not a being who became divine, but utterly unique. \n- The second clause, “As God now is, man may become,” is handled with appropriate nuance. The answer recognizes a real overlap with the orthodox concept of theosis (deification by grace and participation in God’s life) but correctly distinguishes that in orthodox theology humans are transformed by grace and remain creatures, never becoming God by nature or essence. It mentions the orthodox distinction between God’s essence and God’s energies to preserve the Creator–creature boundary. \n- The response accurately contrasts LDS exalting theology (often summarized as exaltation to godhood) with orthodox deification, clarifying that the latter is about union with God by grace, not ontological equivalence with the divine essence. \n- The answer acknowledges surface-level kinship in language while maintaining doctrinal boundaries, which is the core nuance Christians historically emphasize. It also offers to compare with Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant perspectives, demonstrating broader, careful engagement with the topic. \nOverall, the evaluation aligns with biblical and historical Christian teaching: God’s eternality and transcendence are affirmed, and deification is a grace-filled participation in God’s life rather than an ascent to ontological deity. No theological errors are present in the response. The analysis is well-grounded in scripture (e.g., John 1:1–3; 2 Peter 1:4; Romans 8:29; 1 John 3:2) and classic doctrinal distinctions (essence vs. energies, Creator–creature)."
