        "expected": "",
        "output": "Short answer: Christians can and often should engage in public life to promote justice, care for the vulnerable, and the common good—but they should do so in a way that honors religious liberty and pluralism, and avoids coercing others to conform to a particular faith.\n\nA balanced way to think about it:\n- Why Christians might want to influence law and government\n  - Public witness: moral principles like dignity, justice, mercy, protection of the vulnerable reflect core Christian values.\n  - Common good: policies that reduce poverty, protect families, uphold human rights, care for the vulnerable, combat exploitation, and promote fairness often align with biblical ethics.\n  - Civic responsibility: believers are part of society and are called to seek truth and justice in the public square.\n\n- Important cautions\n  - Avoid coercion and favoritism: laws should not privilege one religion over others or coerce unbelievers or people of other faiths to adhere to Christian doctrine.\n  - Respect pluralism and religious liberty: a diverse society requires protections for all beliefs and for those with no religious affiliation.\n  - Beware Christian nationalism: conflating faith with a particular political or national identity can distort the Gospel and threaten liberty for everyone.\n  - Distinguish personal conscience from public policy: individuals may hold strong beliefs, but public policy should be shaped through fair processes and respect for rights.\n\n- How to engage responsibly\n  - Frame values in universal terms: articulate moral aims in ways that can be understood and supported across faiths and by non-religious citizens (dignity of persons, justice, care for the vulnerable, justice for the poor, protection of children, humane treatment of immigrants, etc.).\n  - Practice civil discourse and coalitions: work with people of other faiths and with secular groups to pursue common goods.\n  - Use legitimate civic channels: vote, advocate through civil society, participate in policy discussions, run for office, or contribute to public debate with humility and fidelity to truth.\n  - Protect rights and freedoms: defend religious liberty for all and resist any attempt to enforce a single religious viewpoint through law.\n\n- If you want a more concrete answer, tell me your country or denomination. Different traditions (Catholic social teaching, Protestant reform traditions, Orthodox perspectives) emphasize different emphases in public life, and the legal framework (for example, separation of church and state) shapes what is prudent or permissible.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor this to a specific Christian tradition or country and discuss typical positions, examples of policy areas, and how theologians and church leaders counsel public engagement.",
