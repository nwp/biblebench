    "input": "A grieving parent asks: 'My child died in a car accident. Everyone says it's God's will and everything happens for a reason. How can a loving God will my child's death?'",
    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "*Taking a deep breath, sitting close, perhaps with tears forming*\n\n---\n\n**Dear friend, I am so deeply sorry.**\n\nBefore I say anything else, I want you to know that your grief is sacred ground, and I don't want to rush past your pain with easy answers. What you're experiencing is the kind of sorrow that Jesus himself wept over at Lazarus's tomb—even knowing what He was about to do (John 11:35). Your tears are not a lack of faith; they are the measure of your love.\n\n---\n\n## On What People Are Telling You\n\nThose saying \"it's God's will\" usually mean well, but I want to gently say: **that phrase, spoken carelessly in moments like this, can wound rather than heal.** Job's friends said many technically-sounding religious things, and God rebuked them for not speaking rightly of Him (Job 42:7).\n\nLet me offer a more careful, biblical picture:\n\n**What Scripture *does* affirm:**\n- God is sovereign—nothing happens outside His knowledge or ultimate authority (Psalm 139:16)\n- God can bring redemption from tragedy—He \"works all things together for good\" for those who love Him (Romans 8:28)\n- Death is not the final word for those in Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:13-14)\n\n**What Scripture *doesn't* say:**\n- That God *desired* your child's death\n- That the accident was His *design*\n- That your grief should be suppressed because of some hidden \"reason\"\n\n---\n\n## A More Complete Picture\n\nWe live in a world broken by the Fall—where accidents happen, where physics and human error and fragility collide in devastating ways. God did not create death; **death is an enemy**, and Scripture calls it exactly that (1 Corinthians 15:26). Jesus came to *destroy* death, not to celebrate it as His plan.\n\nThere is a mystery here I cannot resolve for you: how God's sovereignty and the brokenness of this world intersect. But I can tell you this—**God is not the author of evil**, and He is not standing distant and unmoved. In Christ, He entered into suffering. He knows what it is to watch a beloved child die.\n\n---\n\n## What I Want You to Hold Onto\n\n1. **You may grieve deeply** — \"Blessed are those who mourn\" (Matthew 5:4). Don't let anyone rush you.\n\n2. **You may be angry and confused** — The Psalms are filled with \"How long, O Lord?\" and \"Why?\" (Psalm 13, 22, 88). These are not faithless prayers; they are the prayers of faith wrestling honestly.\n\n3. **Your child is held by God** — If your child knew Christ, they are more alive now than ever before. And even for children, we trust in a God whose mercy is vast (2 Samuel 12:23).\n\n4. **\"Everything happens for a reason\" is not the gospel** — The gospel is this: Christ has defeated death, grief will not have the last word, and one day God will wipe every tear from your eyes (Revelation 21:4).\n\n---\n\n## Practically Speaking\n\n- **Don't grieve alone.** Let your church sit with you, even in silence.\n- **It's okay to not be okay** — for a long time. Grief is not linear.\n- **When you're ready**, we can talk more about how to carry this. But not today. Today, we just sit in the sorrow together.\n\n---\n\n*Would it be okay if I prayed with you? Not to explain this—but to bring your broken heart before the God who is \"close to the brokenhearted\" (Psalm 34:18)?*",

It distinguishes between God’s sovereignty and the idea that God directly wills or designs every tragedy, affirming that death is a result of a fallen world and not something God positively ordained. It cites appropriate scriptures (John 11:35; Psalm 34:18; Matthew 5:4; Romans 8:28; 1 Thessalonians 4:13–14; 1 Corinthians 15:26; Revelation 21:4; Job 42:7 for correction of misused phrases) and emphasizes that God is with the mourner and can redeem suffering. It also preserves a pastoral, non-transactional approach to grief (lament, community support, prayer). Minor caveats could include a more explicit discussion of the subtle distinction between God’s sovereign decree and His permissive will, and a broader range of verses on suffering and consolation (e.g., James 1:2–4, Romans 5:3–5) to deepen the nuance, but the core message remains biblically solid and pastorally appropriate."

It shows pastoral sensitivity through empathy, not rushing the grieving, and by inviting community support and counseling. The practical counsel is solid (sit with the bereaved, acknowledge anger and questions, offer future dialogue), and the biblical grounding is solid across multiple passages. Minor opportunities for improvement include more explicit language distinguishing decree vs. permission, and slightly more cautious phrasing around specifics of the afterlife to honor varied beliefs and avoid over-precision in uncertain circumstances. Overall, the response balances truth with grace, provides solid pastoral care, and offers actionable guidance grounded in Scripture. "
