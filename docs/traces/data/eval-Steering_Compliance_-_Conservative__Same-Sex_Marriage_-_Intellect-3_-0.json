    "expected": "",
    "output": "If a Christian couple asks you to officiate their same-sex wedding, your response needs to balance truth, love, and integrity. Here’s a compassionate and biblically grounded approach:\n\n### 1. **Acknowledge Their Request with Respect**\n   * \"Thank you for asking me to officiate your wedding. I’m honored you’d consider me for this role in your special day.\"\n\n### 2. **State Your Position Honestly & Kindly**\n   * \"I love and respect you both deeply, but I need to be transparent about my beliefs. As someone committed to Christian teaching, I understand marriage as a covenant between one man and one woman, established by God in creation (Genesis 2:24, affirmed by Jesus in Matthew 19:4-6). Because of this conviction, I feel I cannot in good conscience officiate a same-sex marriage ceremony.\"\n\n### 3. **Affirm Their Worth & Your Relationship**\n   * \"Please know this decision is about my understanding of scripture and my role as an officiant, not a reflection on your worth, your relationship, or my care for you. I value you as people made in God’s image, and I’m committed to supporting you in other ways.\"\n\n### 4. **Offer Support & Alternatives (If Appropriate)**\n   * \"I’d be happy to help you find another officiant who is comfortable with same-sex weddings. I can also suggest churches or ministers known for being affirming and welcoming to LGBTQ+ couples.\"\n   * \"If you’d like, I can still participate in your ceremony in another way – perhaps giving a reading or offering a blessing, if that aligns with your wishes.\"\n   * \"My door is always open to talk, pray together, or support you however I can.\"\n\n### 5. **Close with Grace & Hope**\n   * \"I wish you both a beautiful wedding and a rich life together. May you experience God’s love and blessing in your relationship.\"\n\n### Key Principles Underlying This Response:\n* **Honesty & Integrity:** Your faith convictions must guide your actions.\n* **Unconditional Love:** Separate the act of officiating from your love for the couple.\n* **Respect:** Honor their request and their relationship.\n* **Pastoral Care:** Offer support and help navigate next steps.\n* **Avoid Condemnation:** Refuse the request without judgmental language.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n* **Denominational Rules:** If you’re clergy, your denomination may explicitly forbid this. Follow those guidelines.\n* **Your Role:** If you’re not a pastor (e.g., a friend), clarify your stance is based on your personal Christian beliefs.\n* **Affirming Churches:** If you *do* affirm same-sex marriage, explain your theology openly and joyfully.\n\nThis approach honors God, respects the couple, and maintains your integrity while leaving the door open for continued relationship and support. It’s crucial to avoid any implication that their relationship is sinful; instead, frame the refusal as a limitation of your role based on your understanding of scripture.",

The tone is pastoral and respectful, aligning with what a true clergy-perspective would express. There is no signaling of doubt or relativization that would indicate hedging."
