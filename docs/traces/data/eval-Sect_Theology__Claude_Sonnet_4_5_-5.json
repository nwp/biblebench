    "input": "A Jehovah's Witness says that Jesus was not physically resurrected - instead, God disposed of his body and Jesus was raised as a spirit creature. What does orthodox Christianity teach about Jesus' resurrection?",
    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity affirms the bodily, physical resurrection of Jesus as essential to the faith (1 Corinthians 15:14). Jesus appeared in a physical body that could be touched (Luke 24:39, John 20:27), ate food (Luke 24:42-43), and still bore the crucifixion wounds. The empty tomb accounts confirm the body was gone because Jesus was raised, not that it was discarded. Jesus explicitly denied being merely a spirit: 'a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have' (Luke 24:39). The physical resurrection guarantees believers' future bodily resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:20-23) and validates Jesus' victory over death. Denying the physical resurrection undermines the gospel.",
    "output": "# Orthodox Christian Teaching on Jesus' Resurrection\n\n## The Orthodox Position\n\nOrthodox Christianity across all major traditions (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant) unanimously affirms the **physical, bodily resurrection** of Jesus Christ. This is considered a non-negotiable, foundational doctrine of the Christian faith.\n\n### Key Biblical Evidence Used:\n\n1. **The Empty Tomb** - All four Gospels emphasize the tomb was empty (Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, John 20)\n\n2. **Jesus' Own Statements** - \"Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days\" (John 2:19-21, referring to his body)\n\n3. **Physical Demonstrations** - Post-resurrection, Jesus:\n   - Showed his wounds (John 20:27)\n   - Ate food (Luke 24:42-43)\n   - Invited physical touch (Matthew 28:9, John 20:27)\n   - Explicitly stated: \"A spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have\" (Luke 24:39)\n\n4. **Paul's Theology** - 1 Corinthians 15 argues the physical resurrection is essential to Christian faith: \"If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile\" (v. 17)\n\n### The Nature of the Resurrection Body\n\nOrthodox teaching holds that Jesus was raised in a **glorified physical body** - the same body that was crucified, but transformed:\n- Still physical and material\n- Bearing crucifixion marks\n- Yet possessing new properties (appearing in locked rooms, etc.)\n- The \"firstfruits\" of the resurrection believers will experience (1 Corinthians 15:20)\n\n## How the Jehovah's Witness View Departs\n\nThe Watchtower teaching represents a **significant departure** from historic Christianity:\n\n### Areas of Disagreement:\n\n1. **Denial of Physical Resurrection** - Their teaching that God \"disposed of\" or \"dissolved\" Jesus' body contradicts the Gospel accounts of the empty tomb and Jesus' physical appearances\n\n2. **Re-creation vs. Resurrection** - The JW view essentially describes God creating a new spirit creature, not raising the same person who died\n\n3. **Different Understanding of Jesus' Nature** - This connects to their belief that Jesus is Michael the Archangel, not God incarnate\n\n### Why This Matters Theologically:\n\nOrthodox Christianity sees several critical problems with the non-physical resurrection view:\n\n- **Undermines the Incarnation** - If God truly became human, the resurrection of his human body matters\n- **Compromises Atonement** - The same body that suffered must be vindicated\n- **Affects Our Hope** - Christians believe in future bodily resurrection (Romans 8:11, 1 Corinthians 15:42-44); Jesus' physical resurrection is the prototype\n- **Questions Biblical Reliability** - Requires reinterpreting clear physical descriptions as symbolic\n\n## Historical Christian Consensus\n\nFrom the earliest creeds onward, bodily resurrection has been affirmed:\n- **Apostles' Creed** (c. 140 AD): \"the resurrection of the body\"\n- **Nicene Creed** (325 AD): \"On the third day he rose again\"\n- Early church fathers uniformly taught physical resurrection\n\nThis hasn't been a matter of denominational debate - it's been universally held across Christian traditions for 2,000 years.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe physical, bodily resurrection of Jesus is considered **essential doctrine** in orthodox Christianity. The Jehovah's Witness teaching represents a fundamental departure from this historic Christian position and would be considered heretical by traditional Christian standards. While we should engage this topic respectfully, orthodox Christianity views the denial of Christ's bodily resurrection as incompatible with biblical Christianity.",

          "rationale": "The answer aligns well with orthodox Christian teaching: Jesus’ bodily resurrection is presented as central and scripturally grounded, with explicit defenses against a purely spiritual resurrection (e.g., Luke 24:39; John 20:27; Luke 24:42-43; 1 Cor 15). It correctly contrasts with Jehovah’s Witnesses’ view and notes the doctrinal significance for atonement and future resurrection. The main areas for improvement are precise wording about unanimity and creedal variation, and a more explicit treatment of Paul’s language in 1 Corinthians 15:44 (spiritual body vs. glorified physical body) to acknowledge legitimate interpretive nuance."
