This served as something of a theological \"letter of introduction.\"\n\n### 2. **To Seek Support for His Spanish Mission**\nPaul hoped Rome would become a base of support for his planned missionary journey to Spain (Rom. 15:23-24, 28). He needed their partnership—both prayerful and material.\n\n### 3. **To Address Jewish-Gentile Tensions**\nA significant portion of the letter (especially chapters 9-11 and 14-15) addresses the relationship between Jews and Gentiles in God's redemptive plan, likely reflecting real tensions within the Roman congregation—possibly exacerbated after Jewish Christians returned following their expulsion under Claudius (Acts 18:2).",

        "output": "# The Purpose of the Book of Revelation\n\n## Primary Purposes\n\n**1. To Encourage Persecuted Christians**\nThe most immediate purpose was to strengthen believers facing persecution, likely during the reign of Domitian (c. 95 AD) or possibly Nero (mid-60s AD). The seven churches of Asia Minor were experiencing various pressures—Roman imperial cult worship, social ostracism, and in some cases martyrdom. Revelation assured them that their suffering was temporary and that God would ultimately triumph.\n\n**2. To Reveal God's Sovereignty Over History**\nThe book demonstrates that despite appearances, God remains in control of human events. The throne room vision (chapters 4-5) establishes this theme—Christ, the slain Lamb, holds the scroll of history and is worthy to open it.\n\n**3. To Call for Faithful Endurance**\nA recurring exhortation throughout is to \"overcome\" or \"conquer\" (Greek: *nikaō*). Believers are urged to remain faithful even unto death, resisting compromise with Roman paganism and emperor worship.\n\n**4. To Unveil the Ultimate Victory of Christ**\nRevelation provides an apocalyptic vision of Christ's return, the defeat of evil (Satan, the beast, the false prophet), final judgment, and the establishment of the New Heaven and New Earth.\n\n## Literary Context\n\nAs apocalyptic literature, it used symbolic imagery familiar to first-century readers to communicate hope while also containing prophetic elements about future fulfillment—a balance scholars continue to interpret in various ways.",

        "output": "# Why Jesus Used Parables in His Teaching\n\n## The Biblical Explanation\n\nJesus himself addressed this question directly when his disciples asked him in **Matthew 13:10-17** (paralleled in Mark 4:10-12 and Luke 8:9-10). His answer reveals multiple purposes:\n\n### 1. **To Reveal Truth to Receptive Hearts**\nParables served as vehicles for revealing \"the secrets of the kingdom of heaven\" to those genuinely seeking truth (Matthew 13:11). For receptive listeners, these stories illuminated profound spiritual realities.\n\n### 2. **To Conceal Truth from Hardened Hearts**\nParadoxically, Jesus indicated that parables also obscured meaning from those who had already rejected him. He quoted Isaiah 6:9-10 about people who \"seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear\" (Matthew 13:13). This reflects a judicial aspect—those who persistently refused the truth would find it increasingly hidden.\n\n### 3. **To Fulfill Prophecy**\nMatthew notes this fulfilled Psalm 78:2: \"I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world\" (Matthew 13:35).\n\n## Practical and Pedagogical Reasons\n\n- **Memorable**: Stories stick in memory better than abstract teaching\n- **Accessible**: Agricultural and domestic imagery connected with ordinary people\n- **Disarming**: Parables could bypass listeners' defenses (as Nathan's parable did with David)\n- **Provocative**: They invited reflection and self-examination\n- **Safe**: In a politically charged environment, indirect speech offered some protection",

It also correctly notes Matthew 13:35’s quotation of Psalm 78:2 as a basis for the claim that Jesus spoke in parables to reveal things hidden from old. The answer adds plausible pedagogical reasons (memorable, accessible imagery, provocative/reflection-inviting, safe in a volatile context) and mentions prophecy fulfillment, which aligns with scholarly presentation. The analogy to Nathan’s parable is a reasonable rhetorical point, though not essential to the historical claim. Minor textual wording differences between Psalm 78:2 and Matthew 13:35 exist across translations (e.g., “dark sayings of old” vs. “things hidden since the foundation of the world”), but these do not undermine accuracy.
