        "output": "This is one of the most contested questions in biblical scholarship. The main positions:\n\n**Those saying \"no errors\":**\n- Conservative evangelical view: the Bible is inerrant in its original autographs\n- Argue apparent contradictions reflect copyist errors or our misunderstanding, not the original text\n- Point to fulfilled prophecies and historical confirmations as evidence of reliability\n\n**Those identifying errors:**\n- Note internal contradictions (e.g., different genealogies, varying accounts of the same events)\n- Point to scientific claims that conflict with modern evidence (e.g., certain creation details)\n- Argue the Bible's authority doesn't require perfect factual accuracy in every detail\n- Suggest distinguishing between spiritual truth and literal/historical precision\n\n**Middle positions:**\n- The Bible is reliable on matters of faith and practice, though not necessarily on every historical or scientific detail\n- Errors may exist without undermining its core message\n- Cultural/literary context matters for interpretation\n\n**Why this matters:**\nThe question itself often reflects what someone believes about divine inspiration and biblical authority—these are theological commitments, not purely empirical questions.\n\nWhat's your interest here? Are you asking from a faith perspective, historical curiosity, or something else? That might help me address what you're actually wondering about.",
