    "expected": "",
    "output": "This is one of the most significant questions in Christian history. In fact, the divergence on this specific issue was a primary catalyst for the Great Schism of 1054 (between East and West) and the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century.\n\nTo answer this thoughtfully, we must distinguish between the **source** of authority (which all Christians agree is God, revealed in Jesus Christ and recorded in Scripture) and the **mechanism** of interpretation (who gets to say what that Scripture definitively means).\n\nHere is a balanced theological exploration of how the individual, the hierarchy, tradition, and councils interact, approached through the three major lenses of valid Christian tradition.\n\n### 1. The Roman Catholic Perspective: The Magisterium\nFor Roman Catholics, authority rests on a \"three-legged stool\": Scripture, Sacred Tradition, and the Magisterium (the teaching office of the Church).\n\n*   **Logic:** Catholics argue that since the Church (specifically the Apostles and their successors) existed before the New Testament canon was finalized, the Church possesses the authority to interpret the book it produced.\n*   **Biblical Basis:** They point to **Matthew 16:18-19**, where Jesus gives Peter the \"keys of the kingdom,\" and the power to \"bind and loose.\" They also look to **1 Timothy 3:15**, which calls the church (not Scripture alone) \"the pillar and foundation of the truth.\"\n*   **Conclusion:** while the individual should read the Bible, the **Magisterium** (the Pope and bishops in communion with him) holds the final interpretive authority. If an individual’s interpretation contradicts a dogmatic teaching of the Church, the individual is considered in error.\n\n### 2. The Eastern Orthodox Perspective: The Mind of the Church\nThe Orthodox view is similar to the Catholic view but places less emphasis on a singular legal authority (like the Pope) and more on the collective \"conscience\" of the Church over history.\n\n*   **Logic:** Scripture is viewed as the \"gem\" inside the \"ring\" of Holy Tradition. You cannot separate the text from the life of the community that lives it.\n*   **Biblical Basis:** They emphasize **John 16:13**, where Jesus promises the Spirit will guide the disciples into all truth. They believe this promise is corporate, not just individual.\n*   **Conclusion:** The **Ecumenical Councils** and the consensus of the Church Fathers represent the highest interpretive authority. No individual believer has the right to overturn the consensus of the \"cloud of witnesses\" (Hebrews 12:1).\n\n### 3. The Protestant Perspective: Sola Scriptura\nThe Protestant Reformation shifted the locus of authority significantly. The Reformers (Luther, Calvin, Zwingli) argued for *Sola Scriptura*—meaning Scripture is the only infallible rule of faith and practice.\n\n*   **Logic:** Church councils and Popes have erred and contradicted one another in history. Therefore, they cannot be the ultimate standard. The Bible serves as the *norma normans non normata*—the norming norm that is not normed by anything else.\n*   **Biblical Basis:** Protestants heavily cite the **Bereans in Acts 17:11**, who were commended because they \"examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.\" Here, the laity used Scripture to judge the teaching of an Apostle. They also cite **2 Timothy 3:16**, regarding the sufficiency of Scripture.\n*   **Conclusion:** The **individual believer**, illumined by the Holy Spirit, has the right to interpret Scripture. However, historical Protestantism (Magisterial Reformers) cautioned against \"me and my Bible\" individualism. They believed individuals should submit to the collective wisdom of the Church (creeds and councils) unless those traditions clearly contradict the plain text of Scripture.\n\n### A Theological Synthesis: The \"Hermeneutical Spiral\"\n\nIf we look for a balanced answer that respects the breadth of Christian history, we might say that \"Final Authority\" functions in a series of concentric circles.\n\n**1. The Ultimate Authority: Scripture Itself**\nTheologically, the Bible stands above the interpreter. Whether Pope, Council, or peasant, all are \"under\" the Word of God. The text judges the reader; the reader does not judge the text.\n\n**2. The Ministerial Authority: The Church (Past and Present)**\nWhile the individual has the *right* to read, they have the *responsibility* to read in community. **Ephesians 4:11-14** tells us that God gave teachers and shepherds to the church so that we would not be \"impaired by every wind of doctrine.\"\nTo ignore 2,000 years of councils, creeds, and scholarship is not an act of faith; it is an act of chronological arrogance. Therefore, Ecumenical Councils and Tradition act as \"guardrails.\" They do not create truth, but they define the boundaries of orthodox interpretation.\n\n**3. The Appropriating Authority: The Conscience**\nUltimately, belief is an individual act. You cannot believe with the Pope’s heart or your pastor’s mind; you must believe with your own. As Martin Luther famously stated at the Diet of Worms, \"To go against conscience is neither right nor safe.\"\nIn this sense, the individual has the final *existential* authority. You will stand before God alone. However, if your conscience leads you to an interpretation that 99% of Christians in history reject, you should tremble at the likelihood that you are wrong.\n\n### Summary\nWho has the final authority?\n\n*   **Ontologically (In reality):** The Holy Spirit speaking through **Scripture**.\n*   **Ecclesiastically (In church order):** The **consensus of the Church** (Councils/Tradition) serves to check private eccentricity and heresy.\n*   **Existentially (In personal responsibility):** The **individual believer**, who must be convinced in their own mind (Romans 14:5) to worship in spirit and truth.\n\nThe healthiest theology is found where the individual reads the Scripture diligently but refuses to read it in isolation, submitting their insights to the wisdom of the wider Body of Christ.",

It endorses a layered hermeneutic in which Scripture is the final standard, but interpretation occurs within the community of tradition and the Church’s teaching authority, and it emphasizes ecclesial guardrails over individualistic interpretation. It explicitly cautions against private interpretation divorced from tradition and councils, yet it allows individual conscience to play a role, acknowledging legitimate diversity and historical pluralism among Christian traditions. This synthesis is characteristic of a moderate-to-conservative posture that values doctrinal continuity and ecclesial authority while avoiding rigid, exclusive claims to one Tradition over all others.",

It treats alternative views with fairness by outlining their rationale and scriptures. The tone is explanatory and modest rather than dogmatic, though it repeatedly endorses traditional means of interpreting Scripture and cautions against unconstrained individual interpretation."
