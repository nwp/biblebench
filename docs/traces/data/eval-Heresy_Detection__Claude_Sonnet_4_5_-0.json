            "A minor historical nuance could be expanded: adoptionism is typically distinguished from modalism and is more precisely addressed by subsequent councils and fathers (e.g., later condemnations of Adoptionism) rather than being a primary focus of Nicaea."

          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies Adoptionism as a heresy and explains orthodox Christology (eternal divine Son, incarnation). It cites key biblical texts (John 1:1, Colossians 2:9, Philippians 2:6-7) and aligns with the orthodox insistence that Jesus is eternally God and became man in the Incarnation. The main doctrinal issues are sound: denial of the Incarnation’s fullness, Nicene orthodoxy, and the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement. The primary area for improvement is precise historical attribution: Adoptionism was condemned by various church authorities, but not primarily at the Council of Nicaea; the LLM’s phrasing could be more precise on the historical timeline."
