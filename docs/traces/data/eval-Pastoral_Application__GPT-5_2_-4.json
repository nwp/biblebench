    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "You are not necessarily failing spiritually because you take medication, and you’re not disqualified as a Christian because you struggle with depression. Depression is a real kind of suffering in a fallen world, and faithful believers have wrestled with profound darkness.\n\n### 1) Your struggle is not proof that your faith is fake\nScripture gives us language for seasons that feel heavy, numb, or hopeless. David—called “a man after God’s own heart”—often wrote from deep distress:\n\n- “Why are you cast down, O my soul…?” (Psalm 42:5)  \n- “How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever?” (Psalm 13:1)\n\nElijah, after a great spiritual victory, sank into despair and asked God to take his life (1 Kings 19:4). That wasn’t spiritual success on display—but God met him with care, not condemnation: rest, food, and gentle guidance (1 Kings 19:5–8, 11–13).\n\nEven the apostle Paul spoke of being “so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself” (2 Corinthians 1:8). Yet he frames it as a season in which God was teaching deeper dependence, not as evidence that Paul lacked saving faith (2 Corinthians 1:9).\n\n### 2) Medication is not automatically a lack of trust in God\nChristians sometimes talk as if “trusting God” means refusing any help. But Scripture doesn’t treat ordinary means as a rival to faith. God often provides help through “means”—people, counseling, rest, food, community, and yes, medical care.\n\nPaul even advised Timothy to use a practical remedy for his stomach issues: “Use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments” (1 Timothy 5:23). That’s not a command for everyone, but it shows the principle: seeking bodily help can be wise, and can be consistent with faith.\n\nIf you take medication with prayerful dependence—thanking God for provision, staying attentive to wise medical counsel, and keeping your heart anchored in Christ—this can be an expression of humility, not unbelief. Like Nehemiah, you can pray and take appropriate action at the same time (Nehemiah 2:4–8).\n\n### 3) Depression is suffering; it calls for compassion, not simplistic judgments\nSometimes Christians offer quick explanations because they’re uncomfortable with pain. But Scripture warns us against that kind of counsel. Job’s friends assumed suffering always meant spiritual failure; God corrected them strongly (Job 42:7). Jesus also rejected the idea that hardship is always a direct indicator of personal sin (John 9:1–3).\n\nTo be clear: our spiritual lives do affect our emotional lives, and God can use depression to draw us to himself. But it’s not biblically faithful to say, “If you had more faith, you wouldn’t be depressed,” or “If you trusted God, you wouldn’t need medication.”\n\n### 4) Ask two questions: Is this helping me love God and neighbor? Is it wise and overseen?\nA good, practical way to evaluate medication (and any treatment) is:\n\n**A. Is it helping me function in the callings God has given me?**  \nDepression can impair sleep, focus, relationships, work, and worship. If medication helps you be more present, more stable, and better able to engage life and faith, that can be a genuine mercy.\n\n**B. Is it being used wisely?**  \nIt matters that you’re working with a responsible medical professional, monitoring side effects, and not self-medicating. Medication is not a savior; it’s a tool. Jesus is your Savior.\n\n**C. Am I also tending my soul and my supports?**  \nOften the best care is layered care: medication, counseling/therapy, healthy rhythms, supportive community, and spiritual practices. Think “whole-person” care—body and soul.\n\n### 5) What “faith” looks like when you’re depressed\nFaith is not mainly a feeling of brightness or certainty. Faith is bringing your weakness to Jesus.\n\n- “A bruised reed he will not break” (Isaiah 42:3; Matthew 12:20)  \n- “Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7)  \n- “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted” (Psalm 34:18)  \n- “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9)\n\nSometimes faith looks like praying, “Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!” (Mark 9:24). Sometimes it looks like getting out of bed, taking the next faithful step, and letting others carry you when you can’t carry yourself (Galatians 6:2).\n\n### 6) A few practical next steps\n1. **Stay in care.** Continue working with your prescribing doctor and consider a Christian counselor (or a wise, clinically competent therapist) if you aren’t already.  \n2. **Invite safe community.** Depression thrives in isolation. Choose one or two trusted believers who can check in, pray with you, and help you stay grounded.  \n3. **Keep your spiritual practices “small and steady.”** When you’re depressed, set simple goals: a psalm a day, a short prayer, one worship service, one honest conversation. God honors mustard-seed steps.  \n4. **Be discerning about voices.** If someone repeatedly shames you or speaks in absolutes (“real Christians don’t…”), you can lovingly set boundaries. Not all confident spiritual advice is wise spiritual counsel.  \n5. **If you ever feel at risk of self-harm, seek immediate help.** Tell someone right away and contact local emergency services or a crisis hotline. That is not spiritual failure; that is taking life seriously.\n\n### 7) A pastoral word to your heart\nNo—taking medication does not mean you don’t trust God. And depression does not mean God has turned away from you. In Christ, “there is therefore now no condemnation” (Romans 8:1). Your darkest days do not erase the truth that you are held.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me: What have the hard seasons been like lately—more numbness, more sadness, more anxiety, or more hopeless thoughts? And do you have supportive people around you who know what you’re carrying?",

It affirms that depression is real and not a failure of faith, supports using medical means (medication, counseling) as compatible with faith, and emphasizes faith practiced alongside proper medical care. Scripture is appropriately cited to illustrate that faithful people experience despair without losing their relationship with God, and that reliance on God does not preclude seeking treatment. It offers balanced, practical guidance (community, spiritual disciplines, wise use of medication, boundaries with shaming voices) and warns about self-harm. Nuances are well-handled: faith includes weakness, means are often used by God, and healing can involve both divine grace and medical care. A few minor phrasing choices (e.g., comparing medication to insulin, which is helpful but should be presented carefully to avoid oversimplification) do not meaningfully detract from theological accuracy. Overall, strong doctrinal integrity with thoughtful pastoral nuance."

Practical guidance is clear, compassionate, and actionable: stay in care, build safe community, practice simple spiritual rhythms, set boundaries with overly shaming voices, and have a crisis plan for self-harm. The biblical grounding is strong, including references to Psalms, the life of Elijah, 2 Corinthians, Job, Isaiah, 1 Peter, and Jesus, which supports a balanced, gospel-centered perspective. Overall, the response blends truth with grace, and conviction with compassion, offering a robust framework for navigating depression within a Christian pastoral context."
