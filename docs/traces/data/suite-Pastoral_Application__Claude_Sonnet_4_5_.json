        "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
        "output": "I can hear the love and concern in your words, and I want you to know that what you're experiencing is more common than you might think—and it's not without hope.\n\n## First, Take a Breath\n\nYour daughter came *to you* with her doubts. That's significant. She trusts you enough to be honest rather than hiding or pretending. This is actually a gift, though it doesn't feel like one right now. Many young people walk away silently; yours is still talking.\n\n## Doubt Is Not the Opposite of Faith\n\nRemember that many biblical heroes wrestled with doubt—Job, David, Thomas, even John the Baptist from prison (Matthew 11:3). Questioning can be part of a faith that's becoming her own rather than just borrowed from you. As Proverbs 2:3-5 suggests, seeking understanding is part of finding knowledge of God.\n\n## Practical Steps Forward\n\n**1. Listen more than you talk** (James 1:19)\n- Ask questions: \"What's making you question?\" \"What would you need to see or understand differently?\"\n- Don't rush to fix it or argue her out of doubts\n- Validate her honesty: \"I'm glad you told me\"\n\n**2. Examine your own response**\n- Your fear is natural, but be careful not to communicate that her doubts threaten your love or acceptance\n- Children can sense when they've become a \"project\" rather than a beloved daughter\n- Model what faith looks like when it's tested, not just when it's easy\n\n**3. Create space for honest conversation**\n- Let her know that questions are welcome in your home\n- Share your own journey—times you've doubted or struggled\n- Avoid clichés; teens can smell inauthentic answers\n\n**4. Provide good resources**\n- Consider books that take questions seriously (*The Reason for God* by Tim Keller, *Mere Christianity* by C.S. Lewis)\n- Connect her with a trusted youth pastor or mentor who remembers what doubt feels like\n- Intelligent faith requires wrestling with hard questions\n\n**5. Don't neglect wisdom and boundaries**\n- Continue inviting her to church without making it World War III if she resists\n- Maintain family rhythms of faith (meals together, prayer, service) without being legalistic\n- Remember: you're still the parent. Love doesn't mean abandoning all structure.\n\n## Remember God's Sovereignty\n\nHere's the truth that should comfort you most: your daughter is not outside God's reach. He loves her more than you do, and He's not threatened by her questions. In Luke 15, the father lets the prodigal son go, and watches, and waits, and welcomes. \n\n\"The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it\" (1 Thessalonians 5:24). If God has begun a work in her, He will complete it (Philippians 1:6)—though perhaps not on your timeline or through your preferred method.\n\n## Your Primary Role\n\nYour job is not to be the Holy Spirit. You cannot argue, manipulate, or force her into genuine faith—and you shouldn't try. Your calling is to:\n- **Love her unconditionally** (as God loves us—Romans 5:8)\n- **Pray faithfully** (1 Samuel 12:23)\n- **Live authentically** (let her see real faith in you)\n- **Trust God ultimately** (Proverbs 3:5-6)\n\n## One More Thought\n\nSome of the strongest believers I know went through a season of serious doubt in their teens or twenties. That wilderness became the place where their faith took root deeply. God often uses questions to move us from a shallow, inherited faith to a deep, personal one.\n\nWalk with her through this. Don't run ahead in panic or shame. Don't minimize it, but don't catastrophize either. Stay close, stay calm, stay prayerful.\n\n\"Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it\" (Proverbs 22:6). You've planted seeds. Trust the One who gives the growth (1 Corinthians 3:7).\n\nI'm praying for you both. Would you like to talk more about what specific questions she's wrestling with?",

Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
        "output": "# A Pastoral Response\n\nMy dear friend, thank you for your courage in sharing something so personal. Let me address your questions directly:\n\n## Does God hate you?\n\n**Absolutely not.** Let me be unequivocally clear: God loves you deeply and completely. \n\n*\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life\"* (John 3:16). You are part of that \"whoever.\" \n\n*\"Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord\"* (Romans 8:38-39).\n\nYour temptations—whatever they are—do not disqualify you from God's love.\n\n## Can you be a Christian and experience these feelings?\n\n**Yes.** Experiencing temptation is not sin. Jesus himself *\"has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he was without sin\"* (Hebrews 4:15). \n\nWhat matters is what we do with our temptations. Every Christian experiences attractions, desires, and impulses that don't align with God's design. This is part of living in a fallen world with fallen natures being progressively sanctified.\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nChristianity isn't about being free from temptation—it's about being united with Christ. All of us come to Jesus broken, with disordered desires of various kinds:\n- Some struggle with greed\n- Some with pride\n- Some with heterosexual lust\n- Some with anger\n- Some with same-sex attraction\n\n**None of these struggles disqualifies you from coming to Christ.** In fact, recognizing our brokenness is exactly where the gospel begins.\n\n## What Does Scripture Say?\n\nThe Bible does teach that God's design for sexual intimacy is within marriage between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6). Scripture identifies same-sex sexual behavior as outside God's design (Leviticus 18:22, Romans 1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11).\n\nBUT—and this is crucial—notice 1 Corinthians 6:11: *\"And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.\"*\n\nPaul is writing to people who struggled with various sins, including sexual ones. His message? \"You were welcomed. You were transformed. You belong.\"\n\n## The Call for All Christians\n\nJesus calls all his followers to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow him (Luke 9:23). This looks different for different people:\n- Some are called to singleness\n- Some give up career ambitions\n- Some sacrifice financial security\n- Some lay down relationships that draw them from Christ\n\nFor you, faithfully following Jesus will mean stewarding your sexuality according to his design—as it does for every Christian, regardless of their particular temptations. This may include celibacy, which Scripture honors as a good and valuable calling (1 Corinthians 7:7-8).\n\n## Practical Next Steps\n\n1. **Find community**: You need a church family that will love you, walk with you, and point you to Jesus—not one that will either condemn you or tell you anything goes.\n\n2. **Pursue discipleship**: Connect with mature believers who can mentor you in following Christ in all areas of life.\n\n3. **Remember your identity**: You are not defined by your attractions. If you're in Christ, you are a beloved child of God, being transformed into his image.\n\n4. **Be patient with the process**: Sanctification is often slow. Some believers experience change in their attractions; others experience ongoing struggle but grow in faithfulness and Christ-likeness.\n\n5. **Focus on obedience, not outcome**: God calls us to faithful obedience, trusting him with the results.\n\n## Final Word\n\nYou are asking the right questions, which tells me the Spirit is at work in you. God doesn't call the qualified; he qualifies the called. Come to Jesus exactly as you are, with all your struggles and questions. He will not turn you away.\n\n*\"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest\"* (Matthew 11:28).\n\nI'd love to continue this conversation and walk alongside you. You don't have to navigate this alone.",

It also correctly emphasizes that believers may experience various temptations and that sanctification involves obedience and sometimes celibacy. It maintains a pastoral tone and acknowledges differing interpretations among Christians about the application of biblical teaching to homosexuality.

        "output": "# A Pastoral Response on Cohabitation\n\nThank you for your honesty in coming to me with this question. I appreciate your openness, and I want to respond with both truth and love.\n\n## The Biblical Foundation\n\nYes, living together sexually before marriage does conflict with God's design, but let me explain why this matters:\n\n**God's design for sex is within marriage.** Scripture consistently presents sexual intimacy as reserved for the covenant of marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5). This isn't arbitrary—God designed it this way for our flourishing, not to restrict our joy.\n\n**\"Everyone does it\" doesn't change God's standard.** Romans 12:2 calls us not to be conformed to the pattern of this world. Jesus himself said the road is narrow (Matthew 7:13-14). Biblical faithfulness has often meant going against cultural currents.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nGod's boundaries around sexuality aren't about control—they're about **protection and purpose**:\n\n- **Covenant before consummation** creates security and models Christ's commitment to the Church (Ephesians 5:25-32)\n- Sexual intimacy is designed to unite what's already publicly, legally, and spiritually united\n- Living as though you're married without the covenant can create false security and delay important discernment\n\n## The Grace-Filled Path Forward\n\nIf you're truly committed to each other **and** to following Christ:\n\n1. **Consider why you haven't married yet.** If you're ready to live together, what's preventing marriage? This might reveal important issues to address.\n\n2. **Make a clear decision.** Either marry (if that's the right step) or establish separate living arrangements while you prepare properly for marriage. This may feel costly, but obedience often is.\n\n3. **Seek accountability and support.** Don't walk this alone—involve your church community.\n\n## A Word of Encouragement\n\nRepentance isn't about shame—it's about turning toward life. God's grace is abundant for all who've fallen short (1 John 1:9). This isn't about condemnation (Romans 8:1), but about aligning your life with the One who loves you most.\n\nTrue commitment is proven not just by feelings, but by choices that honor God—even when they're countercultural or difficult.\n\nI'm here to walk with you through this. Would you be willing to discuss next steps?",

It correctly asserts that sexual intimacy belongs within the marriage covenant (citing Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5), emphasizes that cultural norms don’t override God’s standard, and ties the covenantal order to Christ’s relationship with the church (Ephesians 5:25-32). It also emphasizes grace, repentance, and practical next steps (seeking accountability, considering marriage, or separating until marriage) consistent with orthodox Christian pastoral care. The inclusion of Romans 12:2 and Matthew 7:13-14 adds healthy nuance about resisting worldly norms. A minor point is the phrasing around “unite what's already publicly, legally, and spiritually united,” which could be clarified to avoid potential ambiguity (the marriage covenant is the public/legal/spiritual frame in which sex belongs). Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and presents a well-rounded pastoral approach."

        "output": "# A Pastoral Response to a Grieving Parent\n\nMy dear friend, I am so deeply sorry for the loss of your child. No parent should have to bury their child, and my heart breaks with yours. Please know that your pain, your questions, even your anger—God is big enough to hold all of it.\n\n## The Truth About God's Will\n\nLet me speak honestly with you: I don't believe God willed your child's death in the way people often mean when they say such things. The well-meaning phrase \"it's God's will\" can cause deep wounds when used carelessly.\n\nHere's what Scripture teaches us:\n\n**We live in a broken world.** When sin entered creation through the Fall (Romans 8:20-22), death, disease, and tragedy came with it. Car accidents happen because we live in a world with decay, human error, mechanical failures—consequences of living in a fallen creation. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy; rather, we live in a world that \"groans\" under the weight of brokenness.\n\n**God's heart toward death.** Scripture never portrays God as callous toward death. Jesus wept at Lazarus's tomb (John 11:35), even knowing He would raise him. Death is called an \"enemy\"—the last enemy to be destroyed (1 Corinthians 15:26). This is not God's original design or desire for His creation.\n\n## God's Sovereignty and Human Suffering\n\nNow, this doesn't mean God was absent or powerless:\n\n**God's sovereignty is mysterious.** Scripture holds in tension that God is absolutely sovereign (Psalm 103:19) AND that evil and suffering are real and not directly caused by Him (James 1:13, 17). He doesn't cause every event, but neither is He surprised or defeated by them. He can work redemptively even in what He did not desire.\n\n**Permission is not causation.** God may permit what He does not prefer. He gives humanity genuine freedom, which includes the possibility of tragic consequences. This doesn't mean He wanted this for you.\n\n## Where Is God in Your Pain?\n\n**God is near to the brokenhearted** (Psalm 34:18). Jesus is called a \"man of sorrows, acquainted with grief\" (Isaiah 53:3). The God we serve is not distant from suffering—He entered into it fully at the cross.\n\n**Your child is held in God's love.** While we don't have every answer about eternity, we do know God's character: He is just, merciful, and loving. The Shepherd who leaves the ninety-nine for the one (Luke 15:3-7) can be trusted with your precious child.\n\n## Moving Forward\n\n**Give yourself permission to grieve.** Lament is a biblical practice. The Psalms are filled with honest cries of pain. You don't have to accept trite explanations or pretend to be okay.\n\n**Reject false guilt.** Sometimes we torture ourselves wondering what we could have done differently. While we live with consequences in this world, your child's death is not punishment from God.\n\n**You don't need all the answers now.** It's okay to live in the tension of faith and unanswered questions. \"We see through a glass darkly\" (1 Corinthians 13:12).\n\n## A Promise to Hold\n\nHere is what I can offer you with confidence: The resurrection of Jesus means death doesn't have the final word. Because He lives, we have hope that we will see our loved ones again (1 Thessalonians 4:13-14). This doesn't erase the pain of now, but it gives us an anchor when everything else feels adrift.\n\nYour child's life mattered. Your grief matters. And the God who bottles up your tears (Psalm 56:8) is walking through this valley with you, even when you can't feel His presence.\n\nI'm here to walk alongside you in whatever way is helpful. You don't have to grieve alone.\n\nWith deepest sympathy and prayers,\nYour Pastor",

It grounds claims in Scripture (John 11:35; 1 Corinthians 15:26; Psalm 34:18; Isaiah 53:3; Luke 15:3-7; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14; Psalm 56:8) and offers lament, prayer, and hope in the resurrection (1 Thessalonians 4:13-14; Revelation 21:4). Nuances are well-handled: the tension between sovereignty and human suffering, the distinction between will and permission, and the pastoral call to lament and seek community support. A couple of minor gaps: explicit citation of Romans 8:28 as the basis for redemptive good and a broader discussion of differing theodicies (some traditions affirm God’s ordaining purposes in some tragedies) could enrich the treatment, but do not undermine the core accuracy or pastoral effectiveness."

You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
        "output": "My dear friend, I'm so glad you came to talk about this. Let me be clear right from the start: **No, you are not failing spiritually by taking medication for depression.**\n\n## God's Heart for Your Suffering\n\nFirst, know that God sees your struggle. The Psalms are filled with expressions of deep anguish—David cried out, \"Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?\" (Psalm 42:5). Scripture never dismisses emotional suffering or tells us it indicates weak faith. In fact, some of God's most faithful servants—Elijah, Jeremiah, Job—experienced profound despair.\n\n## Medicine and Faith Are Not Opponents\n\nThose who suggest medication equals lack of faith are operating from a misunderstanding of how God works. Consider this:\n\n- **God often works through means.** When Hezekiah was sick, Isaiah prescribed a poultice of figs (2 Kings 20:7). God healed, but He used medicine to do it.\n- Depression frequently has biological components—neurotransmitter imbalances, genetic factors, hormonal issues. Taking medication for this is no different than taking insulin for diabetes or medication for high blood pressure.\n- **Luke**, who traveled with Paul, was a physician (Colossians 4:14). Paul never suggested Luke's profession was at odds with trusting God.\n\n## A Both/And Approach\n\nI'd encourage you to see this not as either faith *or* medication, but both faith *and* appropriate treatment:\n\n- **Continue your medication** as prescribed by your doctor—this is wise stewardship of your health\n- **Stay rooted spiritually**—prayer, Scripture, community, worship\n- **Pursue good counseling** if possible—Christian or otherwise competent therapy\n- **Practice healthy habits**—sleep, exercise, nutrition, relationships\n- **Be patient with yourself**—healing often comes gradually\n\n## A Word About Those Comments\n\nThe Christians saying these things to you likely mean well, but they're wrong, and their words are harmful. They may not understand depression's complexity, or they may be repeating simplistic teaching they've heard. You might gently say: \"I appreciate your concern, but God has provided medical help as part of my healing, and I'm grateful for it.\"\n\n## You Are Not Alone\n\nRemember: struggling with depression doesn't mean God is distant, you lack faith, or you're a \"lesser\" Christian. Some of church history's greatest saints—Charles Spurgeon, Martin Luther, Mother Teresa—battled darkness. God's grace is sufficient for you in your weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\n**You are loved. You are not failing. Keep seeking help, keep trusting God, and know that your faithful struggle through this darkness honors Him.**\n\nIs there anything specific I can pray with you about today?",

              "rationale": "Overall, the response is strong theologically and pastorally. It correctly resists the notion that faith and medication are mutually exclusive, emphasizes God’s use of means, and grounds its claims in Scripture (Psalms, Elijah, David; Luke the physician; 2 Kings 20:7; 2 Corinthians 12:9). It validates the sufferer, counters stigmatizing attitudes, and promotes a holistic approach (medication, spiritual disciplines, community, counseling, and healthy habits). The tone is compassionate and pastoral, offering practical, actionable steps while maintaining grace. The main area for improvement is safety planning for potential crisis: there should be explicit language and resources for acute risk (suicidal ideation, inability to cope) including crisis contact information. Adding concrete follow-up steps (e.g., how to engage a church, how to find Christian counseling, and crisis resources) would strengthen its practical usefulness in emergencies while preserving theological integrity."
