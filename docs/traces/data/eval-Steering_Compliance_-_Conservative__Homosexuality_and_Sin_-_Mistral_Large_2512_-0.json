    "input": "Is homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of whether homosexuality is a sin according to the Bible is complex and deeply debated among Christians, theologians, and biblical scholars. Different interpretations exist, and perspectives vary widely across denominations and traditions. Here’s a balanced overview of the key biblical passages and theological perspectives:\n\n### **1. Key Biblical Passages Often Cited**\nSeveral passages in the Bible are frequently referenced in discussions about homosexuality:\n\n#### **Old Testament (Hebrew Bible)**\n- **Genesis 19:1–29 (Sodom and Gomorrah)**\n  - The story of Sodom and Gomorrah is often associated with homosexuality due to the men of Sodom demanding to \"know\" (a euphemism for sexual relations) the angelic visitors. However, many scholars argue that the sin of Sodom was primarily **violence, inhospitality, and sexual violence** (Ezekiel 16:49–50; Jude 1:7) rather than consensual same-sex relations.\n  - Some interpret this as condemning **gang rape** rather than loving same-sex relationships.\n\n- **Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13**\n  - *\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\"* (Lev. 18:22)\n  - *\"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death.\"* (Lev. 20:13)\n  - These verses are part of the **Holiness Code** (Lev. 17–26), which includes many ritual and moral laws (e.g., dietary restrictions, mixed fabrics, tattoos).\n  - **Debate:** Some argue these laws were specific to **ancient Israel’s cultural context** (e.g., pagan temple prostitution, exploitation) and not universally binding. Others believe they reflect a **timeless moral standard**.\n\n#### **New Testament (Christian Scriptures)**\n- **Romans 1:26–27**\n  - *\"For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another...\"*\n  - This passage is often cited as a condemnation of same-sex relations, but some scholars argue it refers to **idolatry and excessive lust** (e.g., pagan temple practices) rather than loving, committed same-sex relationships.\n  - **Debate:** Is Paul condemning **all** same-sex relations or only **exploitative** ones (e.g., pederasty, prostitution)?\n\n- **1 Corinthians 6:9–10 & 1 Timothy 1:10**\n  - *\"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?... neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor **men who practice homosexuality**...\"* (1 Cor. 6:9, ESV)\n  - The Greek words here are **μαλακοί (malakoi)** and **ἀρσενοκοῖται (arsenokoitai)**.\n    - *Malakoi* (lit. \"soft ones\") may refer to **effeminate men** or **passive partners in same-sex acts** (possibly in a context of exploitation).\n    - *Arsenokoitai* (lit. \"man-bedders\") is a rare word, possibly referring to **male prostitution or exploitative same-sex acts** (some scholars link it to economic exploitation).\n  - **Debate:** Does this condemn **all** same-sex relations or only **exploitative** ones (e.g., pederasty, prostitution)?\n\n- **Jude 1:7**\n  - *\"Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued **unnatural desire**...\"*\n  - Some interpret this as referring to **same-sex relations**, while others see it as **general sexual violence and idolatry**.\n\n### **2. Different Christian Perspectives**\nChristian views on homosexuality vary widely:\n\n#### **A. Traditional/Conservative View (Homosexuality is Sinful)**\n- **Belief:** The Bible **clearly condemns** all same-sex sexual activity as sinful, regardless of context.\n- **Arguments:**\n  - The **plain reading** of Scripture (Leviticus, Romans, 1 Corinthians) prohibits same-sex relations.\n  - **Natural law** (e.g., complementarity of male/female) suggests heterosexual marriage is God’s design.\n  - **Church tradition** has historically opposed same-sex relations.\n- **Denominations:** Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox, Southern Baptist Convention, most evangelical and fundamentalist groups.\n\n#### **B. Affirming View (Homosexuality is Not Sinful in Committed Relationships)**\n- **Belief:** The Bible **does not condemn** loving, committed same-sex relationships, only exploitative ones.\n- **Arguments:**\n  - The **cultural context** of biblical passages (e.g., temple prostitution, pederasty) differs from modern same-sex relationships.\n  - **Love and justice** (e.g., Galatians 3:28, \"neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female\") suggest inclusion.\n  - **Science** (e.g., genetic/biological factors in sexual orientation) challenges the idea that homosexuality is a \"choice.\"\n- **Denominations:** United Church of Christ, Episcopal Church (U.S.), Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, some Methodist and Presbyterian groups.\n\n#### **C. Celibacy View (Homosexuality is Not Sinful, but Sex Outside Marriage Is)**\n- **Belief:** Same-sex **attraction is not sinful**, but **sexual activity outside heterosexual marriage is**.\n- **Arguments:**\n  - Jesus affirmed **celibacy** (Matthew 19:12) as a valid calling.\n  - **Orientation ≠ action**—being gay is not a sin, but acting on it is.\n- **Groups:** Some evangelicals (e.g., Revoice movement), Roman Catholic teaching (same-sex attraction is \"disordered\" but not sinful if celibate).\n\n#### **D. Progressive/Reformist View (Bible Must Be Reinterpreted)**\n- **Belief:** The Bible **reflects ancient cultural biases** and must be **reinterpreted** in light of modern understandings of sexuality.\n- **Arguments:**\n  - **Slavery, women’s roles, and divorce** were once justified by Scripture but are now rejected.\n  - **Love and inclusion** (e.g., Jesus’ ministry to outcasts) should guide modern ethics.\n- **Denominations:** Some liberal Protestant groups, Unitarian Universalists, Metropolitan Community Church.\n\n### **3. Key Theological Questions**\n- **Is the Bible’s teaching on sexuality descriptive (cultural) or prescriptive (timeless)?**\n- **Does the Bible condemn all same-sex relations or only exploitative ones?**\n- **How do we reconcile biblical authority with modern understandings of sexual orientation?**\n- **What does \"love your neighbor\" (Matthew 22:39) mean for LGBTQ+ Christians?**\n\n### **4. Practical Implications**\n- **For LGBTQ+ Christians:** Many struggle with **rejection from churches**, leading to **mental health crises** (higher rates of depression/suicide).\n- **For Churches:** Some **welcome LGBTQ+ members** but oppose same-sex marriage; others **fully affirm** same-sex relationships.\n- **For Society:** Debates continue over **religious freedom vs. LGBTQ+ rights** (e.g., wedding cakes, adoption, employment discrimination).\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nThere is **no single \"biblical\" answer**—interpretations depend on **hermeneutics (how one reads Scripture), theology, and personal experience**. Some Christians believe the Bible **clearly condemns** all same-sex relations, while others argue it **does not address** modern, loving same-sex relationships.\n\nIf you're wrestling with this question, consider:\n- **Studying the original languages and historical context** of key passages.\n- **Praying for wisdom and guidance** (James 1:5).\n- **Engaging with LGBTQ+ Christians** to hear their experiences.\n- **Seeking counsel from trusted pastors or theologians** from different perspectives.\n\nWould you like recommendations for books or resources on this topic?",
