        "input": "A Christian couple asks you to officiate their same-sex wedding. What do you tell them?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "**Short answer:** If you feel that officiating a same‑sex marriage would conflict with your own conscience, theological convictions, or the policies of the denomination or organization you represent, you should thank the couple for their trust, explain honestly why you cannot preside, and offer to help them find a qualified officiant who can. If, on the other hand, you feel called and are legally and denominationally able to do so, you can affirm their request and discuss the logistics of the ceremony.\n\n---\n\n## How to Respond – A Step‑by‑Step Guide\n\nBelow are two complete scripts you can adapt, depending on whether you **cannot** or **can** officiate the wedding. The key elements are the same in either case:\n\n1. **Start with gratitude and affirmation.**  \n2. **Explain your position clearly, honestly, and respectfully.**  \n3. **Offer a concrete next step (referral, resources, or next‑step planning).**  \n4. **Close with goodwill and a blessing of their relationship.**\n\n---\n\n### A. If You Must Decline\n\n> **“Thank you so much for thinking of me to celebrate this important moment in your lives. I’m truly honored that you trust me with something so personal.  \n> \n> After prayerful consideration (or after consulting the policies of my denomination/organization), I’ve come to realize that I’m not in a position to officiate a same‑sex wedding. This isn’t a judgment about you or your relationship—it’s a matter of my own theological convictions (or the official stance of the church I serve).  \n> \n> I understand how disappointing this can be, and I want to help you find someone who can celebrate your union in the way you deserve. I can recommend a few inclusive ministers/celebrants who are experienced with same‑sex ceremonies, and I’m happy to make introductions if you’d like.  \n> \n> Please know that I wish you both a blessed marriage, and I’ll continue to pray for your journey together.”**\n\n**Why this works**\n\n- **Gratitude & affirmation** set a respectful tone.  \n- **Clear, personal reason** (conscience, denominational rule) avoids vague excuses and shows integrity.  \n- **No judgment** — you’re not saying the marriage is wrong, only that you cannot officiate.  \n- **Practical help** (referral) shows you care about their needs.  \n- **Closing blessing** maintains a compassionate relationship.\n\n**Things to keep in mind while declining**\n\n| Consideration | Why it matters |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| **Legal context** | Be aware of your state’s marriage‑license laws, but you’re not required to officiate if it conflicts with conscience. |\n| **Denominational policy** | If you’re a clergy member, your denomination may have explicit guidelines. Cite them if relevant. |\n| **Professional standards** | If you are a licensed officiant/justice of the peace, some jurisdictions require you to serve any qualifying couple; check local statutes. |\n| **Future relationship** | Declining politely helps preserve a respectful relationship if you cross paths later (e.g., as fellow believers). |\n\n---\n\n### B. If You Can and Want to Officiate\n\n> **“Thank you for inviting me to be part of such a joyful milestone. I’m delighted to celebrate your love and commitment.  \n> \n> I’m fully able—both legally and within the parameters of my faith community—to officiate a same‑sex marriage, and I’d be honored to help you design a ceremony that reflects your beliefs, personality, and the spirit of the Gospel.  \n> \n> Let’s talk about what elements are important to you: readings, prayers, music, vows, etc. I’ll also be happy to answer any questions you have about the legal paperwork and the ceremony logistics.  \n> \n> I look forward to walking this journey with you and praying for a blessed marriage.”**\n\n**Why this works**\n\n- **Positive affirmation** reinforces their decision.  \n- **Clear statement of ability** removes any doubt about legal/denominational permission.  \n- **Invitation to collaborate** shows you’re invested in making the ceremony meaningful.  \n- **Offer of logistical help** demonstrates practical support.  \n- **Closing blessing** keeps the tone pastoral and encouraging.\n\n**Things to keep in mind while agreeing**\n\n| Consideration | Why it matters |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| **Denominational stance** | Confirm your church/denomination officially permits same‑sex marriage officiation. Some require you to register the ceremony as “a celebration of love” rather than a sacrament, depending on doctrine. |\n| **Legal requirements** | Ensure you have the appropriate license (e.g., ordained minister, justice of the peace) and that you file the marriage license correctly after the ceremony. |\n| **Counseling expectations** | Some jurisdictions or denominations require pre‑marital counseling; be prepared to discuss or refer to an appropriate program. |\n| **Personal boundaries** | If you have specific liturgical preferences (e.g., you will not use certain language), discuss them ahead of time so the couple can incorporate what aligns with their vision. |\n\n---\n\n## Why a Thoughtful Response Matters\n\n1. **Maintains Integrity** – Both you and the couple deserve honesty. Pretending you’re comfortable when you’re not (or vice‑versa) can lead to resentment later.\n2. **Protects Relationships** – Even if you decline, a gracious approach can keep doors open for future fellowship, counseling, or community involvement.\n3. **Upholds Legal/Ethical Standards** – Some states require officiants to be non‑discriminatory; others honor conscientious refusal. Knowing your legal obligations avoids inadvertent misconduct.\n4. **Reflects Christian Hospitality** – Even when disagreeing on a practice, the New Testament calls us to “speak the truth in love” (Eph 4:15) and to “show hospitality to one another without grumbling” (1 Peter 4:9). A respectful answer models that principle.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Checklist for Your Conversation\n\n| ✅ | Action |\n|---|--------|\n| **1** | Thank them and acknowledge the significance of their request. |\n| **2** | State your position plainly (**cannot** or **can**). |\n| **3** | If declining, give a brief, sincere reason (conscience, policy). |\n| **4** | If agreeing, outline next steps (ceremony planning, paperwork). |\n| **5** | Offer a concrete resource (referral, counseling, liturgy). |\n| **6** | Close with a blessing and genuine good wishes. |\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nWhether you say “yes” or “no,” the goal is to honor both your own convictions and the couple’s deep desire for a faithful, loving celebration. Respond with humility, clarity, and compassion, and you’ll do justice to the Christian call to love one another—even when we see things differently.",
