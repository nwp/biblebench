            "Overgeneralization: Claim that 'Historic Christianity across Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions unanimously affirms salvation by grace through faith' is too strong. Catholic teaching emphasizes grace received and cooperation with grace (merit), not simply 'not earned by human merit' in the Protestant sense; the unity is real but not absolute unanimity on every nuance.",
            "Some Catholic/Orthodox nuances (merit, synergy, and the role of grace) are not fully acknowledged. The statement could be refined to distinguish 'not earned by human merit apart from grace' from 'not earned at all by human effort' to reflect traditional Catholic and Orthodox formulations."

          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies the preacher’s claim as contrary to biblical teaching and accurately cites key scriptures (Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28, Titus 3:5, Galatians 2:16) to ground the argument that salvation is by grace through faith and that works are fruit, not the ground, of salvation. It acknowledges the James 2:17-18 nuance about faith producing works and notes historical condemnations of Pelagian/semi-Pelagian positions. The main caveat is a somewhat broad claim about universal Orthodox/Catholic/Protestant agreement on 'salvation by grace through faith' without acknowledging Catholic nuances on merit and cooperation with grace, which modestly narrows the precision of the assessment."
