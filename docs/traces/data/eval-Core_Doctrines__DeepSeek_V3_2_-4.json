    "expected": "Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both biblical truths held in tension. God is completely sovereign over all things, yet humans are genuine moral agents responsible for their choices. Scripture teaches both that God ordains all things and that humans make real choices for which they are accountable. Different theological traditions emphasize these aspects differently (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), but orthodox Christianity affirms both truths without fully resolving the mystery of how they relate.",
    "output": "### The Relationship Between Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility in Christian Theology\n\nThis is one of the most profound and delicate tensions in Christian theology, addressing how God's complete control over all things coexists with genuine human choice and moral accountability. The relationship is not one of competition but of compatibility within God's ordained order. Scripture affirms both truths without fully explaining their metaphysical reconciliation.\n\n#### 1. **Biblical Affirmation of Divine Sovereignty**\n\nScripture consistently teaches that God reigns supreme over all creation, history, and salvation:\n\n- **Over Creation & Providence:** \"He does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand\" (Daniel 4:35). \"He works all things according to the counsel of his will\" (Ephesians 1:11).\n- **Over Salvation:** Election is ascribed to God's sovereign choice (Ephesians 1:4–5; Romans 9:15–16). Jesus affirmed, \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him\" (John 6:44).\n- **Over Human Events:** \"The heart of the king is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord; he turns it wherever he will\" (Proverbs 21:1). Even evil acts fall under God's sovereign permission and ultimate purpose (Acts 2:23; Genesis 50:20).\n\n#### 2. **Biblical Affirmation of Human Responsibility**\n\nSimultaneously, Scripture treats human choices as real, meaningful, and morally accountable:\n\n- **Moral Commands & Warnings:** \"Choose this day whom you will serve\" (Joshua 24:15). \"Repent and believe in the gospel\" (Mark 1:15).\n- **Accountability for Sin:** \"Each of us will give an account of himself to God\" (Romans 14:12). Judgment is according to works (Revelation 20:12–13).\n- **Prayer & Human Action:** God’s sovereignty does not negate petitionary prayer (Matthew 7:7–11) or diligent effort (Philippians 2:12–13).\n\n#### 3. **Key Theological Principles for Holding Both Together**\n\n**a. Compatibilism (or Concurrence):**  \nThis classical position (held by Augustine, Calvin, and the Reformed tradition) affirms that God’s sovereign decree encompasses all events, including free human choices, in such a way that God’s sovereignty does not violate human freedom but rather establishes the context in which it operates. Humans act voluntarily according to their nature and desires, yet God mysteriously works through these actions to accomplish His purposes. This avoids fatalism by preserving genuine secondary causes.\n\n*Example:* Joseph’s brothers acted wickedly of their own will, yet God intended it for good (Genesis 50:20).\n\n**b. The Mystery of Divine-Hiddenness:**  \nGod’s ways are beyond full human comprehension (Romans 11:33–34). We are called to believe both truths because Scripture teaches them, not because we can fully reconcile them logically.\n\n**c. Asymmetrical Relationship:**  \nGod’s sovereignty is foundational; human responsibility is the necessary corollary within creation. As the Westminster Confession states, \"God from all eternity did… freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass; yet so as thereby neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures\" (WCF 3.1, 5.2).\n\n**d. Different \"Levels\" of Causality:**  \nGod is the primary cause of all things; humans (and natural forces) are secondary causes. God ordains both the ends and the means, including human decisions as real means.\n\n#### 4. **Practical Implications**\n\n- **Humility:** This tension should curb theological arrogance and promote reverence.\n- **Evangelism & Ethics:** God’s sovereignty does not undermine the urgency of preaching or moral obedience (1 Corinthians 15:10; 2 Timothy 2:10). It actually provides the basis for hope in missions (God opens hearts) and comfort in trials (God remains in control).\n- **Assurance:** Salvation rests ultimately on God’s faithful purpose, not human frailty (John 10:27–29).\n- **Warning:** To deny either truth leads to distortions: overemphasis on sovereignty alone can breed passivity or fatalism; overemphasis on human responsibility alone can lead to Pelagianism or anxiety.\n\n#### 5. **Christ as the Unifying Center**\n\nThe incarnation of Christ is the supreme model: In His earthly life, Jesus acted in perfect obedience to the Father’s will (John 6:38) while exercising full human responsibility (Hebrews 5:8–9). At the cross, God’s sovereign plan (Acts 4:27–28) and human guilt (Acts 2:23) converge most dramatically.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe relationship is best summarized in the words of Charles Spurgeon: \"That God predestines, and that man is responsible, are two things that few can see. They are believed to be inconsistent and contradictory; but they are not. It is just the fault of our weak judgment. Two truths cannot be contradictory to each other. If, then, I find taught in one part of the Bible that everything is fore-ordained, that is true; and if I find, in another Scripture, that man is responsible for all his actions, that is true; and it is my folly that leads me to imagine that two truths can ever contradict each other.\"\n\nThus, the biblical witness calls us to affirm **both** with equal force, trusting in the coherence of God’s own mind, while rejecting any synthesis that diminishes either truth.",

            "The piece leans heavily on a Reformed/Calvinist compatibilist framework (compatibilism/concurrence) and Westminster standards as the primary authorities. While this is a valid and historic position, it may underemphasize other orthodox perspectives (e.g., classical Arminianism, Molinism, or open theism) and their nuanced accounts of freedom. A brief acknowledgment of these competing views would improve balance."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is doctrinally robust and biblically grounded. It presents a coherent compatibilist view, cites key scriptures, and aligns with historic orthodoxy on sovereignty and responsibility (including the WCF stance). It also emphasizes the mystery of their relationship and provides practical implications. The main strengths are accurate biblical support, clear articulation of compatibilism, and consistent application to evangelism and assurance. The main minor weaknesses are potential wording ambiguity regarding God ordaining evil and the relatively singular emphasis on a Reformed framework at the expense of broader historic diversity. Overall, the evaluation maintains a high degree of theological accuracy and nuance."

It affirms both God's absolute sovereignty (e.g., election, providence, and the authority of God over history) and genuine human responsibility (moral accountability, repentance, prayer, and works). It explicitly avoids making God the author of sin, aligns with scriptures (e.g., Rom 9, Eph 1, John 6:44, Acts 2:23), and references the Westminster Confession to articulate the intended balance. No indications of Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, or other listed heresies are present. Minor caution for readers from non-Calvinist or Arminian perspectives who might interpret determinism differently, but this is a theological disagreement rather than a heretical claim. Overall, no heresy is detected. "
