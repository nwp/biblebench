    "expected": "This teaching conflicts with the orthodox Christian doctrine of salvation by grace through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28). While orthodox Christianity acknowledges that genuine faith produces good works and obedience (James 2:17), it teaches that salvation is received as a free gift through faith in Christ's finished work, not earned through human effort or religious rituals. The LDS concept of exaltation through temple ordinances (endowment, celestial marriage, etc.) adds requirements beyond what Scripture teaches and represents a works-based salvation system that contradicts the biblical gospel of grace.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately contrasts orthodox Christian soteriology (salvation by grace through faith alone, with works as evidence rather than earning salvation) with the LDS framework (faith, temple ordinances, priesthood authority, ongoing obedience). It correctly cites key biblical passages to support the orthodox view (Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 4:4-5; John 19:30; Hebrews 10:10-14) and notes Galatians 1:8-9 as a warning against adding to the gospel. It acknowledges agreements (Christ as essential, transformation by faith, baptism’s importance) and delineates significant departures (temple rites and exaltation, extra-biblical requirements). The conclusion that the LDS framework represents a different gospel in the orthodox sense aligns with historic Christian critique. The discussion is grounded in Scripture and standard doctrinal distinctions, and it captures important nuances about grace, faith, and works. A minor caveat is that some LDS explanations of grace emphasize divine enablement alongside human effort; the LLM’s framing—while common in orthodox critique—reflects a Protestant polemic rather than a neutral summary. Overall, the assessment is accurate, doctrinally sound, and well-grounded Biblically."
