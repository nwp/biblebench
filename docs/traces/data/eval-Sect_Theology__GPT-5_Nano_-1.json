    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "Short answer\n- The claim describes a Mormon (LDS) understanding of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit that is not the same as historic, orthodox Christian teaching about the Trinity.\n- In historic Christianity, God is one being in three persons (the Trinity): Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are coequal and coeternal and share one divine essence.\n- In Mormon teaching, the Godhead is understood as three distinct beings who are united in purpose rather than one in essence, with differences in their nature (including physical bodies for the Father and the Son in traditional LDS teaching) and with additional scriptures beyond the Bible that claim ongoing revelation.\n- Because of these differences, the Mormon view diverges in important doctrinal areas (nature of God, incarnation, Holy Spirit, revelation, salvation, and the afterlife) from historic Christian theology. There are also areas of common ground (affirming the centrality of Father, Son, and Spirit and the importance of Jesus Christ).\n\nDetailed comparison\n\n1) The core doctrine of God\n- Historic Christian orthodoxy (Catholic, Orthodox, most Protestants): God is one being who exists eternally as three persons (the Trinity). The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are coequal, coeternal, and consubstantial (of the same essence). They are not three separate gods, but one God in three persons.\n  - Key texts often cited: Matthew 28:19 (baptizing in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit), John 1:1-14 (the Word, who is with God and was God), John 10:30 (I and the Father are one), 2 Corinthians 13:14, Romans 8, etc.\n- Mormon theology (as taught in the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price): The Godhead consists of three distinct divine beings: God the Father, Jesus Christ (the Son), and the Holy Ghost. They are united in purpose but are not of one substance. Traditionally, LDS teaching also holds that the Father and the Son have physical bodies of flesh and bones, whereas the Holy Ghost is a spirit; they are not the same being.\n  - This is often summarized as “three separate, distinct personages” who are united in purpose, not “one Being in three persons.”\n\n2) The nature of each member\n- Father: In historic Christianity, God the Father is eternal, invisible, immaterial, and ultimate source of all that exists. He does not have a physical body.\n- Son: The Son (Jesus Christ) is eternally God, made flesh in the Incarnation for the salvation of humanity, fully God and fully man in one person.\n- Holy Spirit: The Holy Spirit is the divine person who proceeds from the Father (and in Western traditions, from the Father and the Son) and who indwells believers.\n- Mormon view diverges on body and nature:\n  - Father and Son: Often described as having tangible bodies (flesh and bones) in their heavenly forms.\n  - Holy Spirit: Described as a “personage of spirit,” not a body, and not the Father or the Son but a distinct person.\n  - The resulting picture is not “one God in three consubstantial persons” but “three gods in unity of purpose,” if stated in classical terms.\n\n3) Revelation and canon\n- Historic Christianity: Revelation is complete in Scripture (the 66 books of the Protestant canon; Catholic and Orthodox traditions include a broader patristic and ecclesial tradition). The Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed (and Chalcedonian definition) articulate core dogmas about the Trinity, Christology, and the nature of God.\n- Mormonism: Adds scriptural texts considered authoritative beyond the Bible (Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price). These are presented as modern revelations and, in LDS faith, are used to clarify, correct, or add to Scripture. This ongoing revelatory framework is a significant departure from the traditional Protestant and Catholic/Orthodox stance that Scripture alone or Scripture plus ancient apostolic tradition is the final authority.\n\n4) Christology (the person and work of Jesus)\n- Historic Christianity: Jesus is eternal God the Son, the Word who became flesh, whose death on the cross atones for sin, and whose resurrection guarantees eternal life for believers. Salvation is by grace through faith in Christ, received by faith, not earned by works.\n- Mormonism: Jesus is the Son of God who has a distinct, exalted status and who can be understood as having a pre-mortal existence as a divine being and a mortal birth to Mary. The atonement is real and central, but LDS soteriology also includes temple rites and a broader soteriological framework (eternal progression, exaltation, and potential eventual godhood in the highest degree of glory). The distinct nature of the Father and Son and their bodies affects how Jesus is understood relative to the Father compared with historic Trinitarian Christology.\n\n5) Holy Spirit\n- Historic Christianity: The Holy Spirit is God—the third person of the Trinity—fully divine, proceeding from the Father (and, in Western tradition, from the Father and the Son). He indwells believers, convicts of sin, empowers sanctification, and unites the church.\n- Mormonism: The Holy Ghost is a distinct divine personage but is often described as a spirit, without a physical body. He can influence and bear witness but is not a third member who shares the same divine nature as the Father and the Son in the same way as in classical Trinitarian theology.\n\n6) Salvation and afterlife\n- Historic Christianity: Salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, secured by his death and resurrection. Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer. After death, believers enter eternal life with God; judgment is universal, and the eternal destiny is heaven or hell (as traditionally taught, with some variation among traditions regarding purgation or intermediate states).\n- Mormonism: Salvation includes additional ordinances and temple rites, and there is a belief in eternal progression and the possibility of exaltation—eventually becoming like God in the highest degree of glory. The afterlife features a tiered heaven (telestial, terrestrial, celestial) and other related concepts. The entry into higher exaltation depends on faith, obedience, temple ordinances, and continued fidelity.\n\n7) Ecclesial authority and church history\n- Historic Christianity: The early ecumenical councils (Nicene, Constantinople, Chalcedon) established the core doctrine of the Trinity. Authority is exercised through apostolic preaching and, in Catholic/Orthodox traditions, through apostolic succession and tradition; in Protestant traditions, through Scripture alone (or Scripture used with confessional standards).\n- Mormonism: Claims a restoration of the original church through Joseph Smith, guided by ongoing revelation given to modern prophets. The priesthood authority and church structure, including temple rites, differ markedly from historic Christian practice.\n\nAreas of agreement and respectful points of dialogue\n- Both traditions affirm a belief in God who reveals Himself and a divine Jesus who is central to salvation.\n- Both hold to the necessity of the Holy Spirit for guiding believers.\n- Both affirm the importance of Scripture as a source of divine truth and the central place of Jesus Christ in salvation.\n- Both emphasize moral living, worship of the one true God, and the importance of faith in Christ.\n\nWhat to keep in mind in discussion\n- Use the terms carefully: when discussing “the Trinity,” refer to the historic doctrine of one God in three coequal persons, “of one substance.” When discussing Mormon beliefs, be clear that they often speak of a Godhead of three distinct beings united in purpose.\n- Recognize the difference between canon and additional revelations: historic Christianity generally regards the biblical canon as complete in itself; Mormonism teaches ongoing revelation through prophets and additional scriptures.\n- Note practical differences: baptismal formulas, the nature of God’s being, the means of salvation, and the afterlife framework differ in important ways.\n\nIf you’re engaging with someone who says they believe these LDS scriptures alongside the Bible, you could gently ask:\n- How do you understand the phrase “one Godhead” in the Bible if you also believe the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct beings?\n- Do you hold that the Father and the Son have physical bodies? If so, how does that affect classical conceptions of God’s simplicity and eternity?\n- Do you see the Holy Spirit as a divine person same in essence as the Father and the Son, or as a separate force or angelic being?\n- How do you reconcile ongoing revelation with passages that describe Scripture as trustworthy and complete (2 Timothy 3:16-17; Jude 3)?\n- How do you understand salvation: is it by grace through Christ alone, or are temple rites and exaltation also required?\n- How do you interpret passages about Jesus’ pre-existence, the nature of God, and the relation between Father and Son (e.g., John 1:1-14; Colossians 1; Hebrews 1)?\n\nIn short: the LDS view and historic Christianity share a focus on Father, Son, and Spirit and on Jesus Christ, but they diverge on the nature of the Godhead, the status and nature of God the Father and Jesus, the role of the Holy Spirit, the authority of additional scriptures, and the anthropology and soteriology that lead to very different understandings of God, incarnation, salvation, and the afterlife.",

          "rationale": "The LLM's response accurately distinguishes historic Christian Trinitarian orthodoxy from Mormon (LDS) teaching. It correctly states that historic Christianity affirms one God in three coequal, coeternal persons sharing one divine essence (the Trinity), and contrasts that with the LDS view of the Godhead as three distinct beings united in purpose, with Father and Son described as having physical bodies and the Holy Spirit as a spirit/individual entity. It also correctly notes LDS canon includes additional scriptures (Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price) and ongoing revelation, and outlines differences in Christology, soteriology (including temple rites and exaltation), and ecclesial authority. The answer provides helpful nuance: it acknowledges common ground (centrality of Jesus, belief in Father, Son, and Spirit) and offers concrete questions for dialogue, while grounding its critique in standard biblical texts (e.g., Matthew 28:19; John 1:1-14; John 10:30) to illustrate orthodox Trinitarian claims. Potential refinements (not errors) could include more precise phrasing about the LDS conceptual language (e.g., “three separate beings” vs. “one in purpose”) and a slightly more guarded note on the variety of LDS teachings across sources, but core content is accurate and nuanced."
