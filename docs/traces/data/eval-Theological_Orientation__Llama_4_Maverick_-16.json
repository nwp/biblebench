    "expected": "",
    "output": "The Bible has a lot to say about social justice, systemic racism, and economic inequality. These themes are woven throughout the biblical narrative, and they are deeply connected to the gospel. In fact, a closer examination of Scripture reveals that these issues are not merely tangential to the Christian faith, but are, in fact, integral to it.\n\nFirst, let's consider the concept of social justice. The Hebrew Bible is replete with injunctions to care for the vulnerable, including the poor, the widow, the orphan, and the stranger (e.g., Deuteronomy 10:18-19, Psalm 146:7-9). The prophets, in particular, rail against systemic injustices, such as exploitation of the poor, unequal weights and measures, and mistreatment of marginalized communities (e.g., Amos 5:10-15, Micah 6:8-12). Jesus himself reiterates this emphasis on justice, proclaiming that the Spirit of the Lord has anointed him \"to preach good news to the poor...to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free\" (Luke 4:18-19, quoting Isaiah 61:1-2).\n\nSystemic racism is also addressed in the Bible. The biblical narrative acknowledges the existence of racism and ethnic tension, and it provides a framework for understanding and addressing these issues. For example, the story of the Exodus highlights God's concern for the liberation of an oppressed people, and the New Testament emphasizes the unity of believers across ethnic lines (e.g., Galatians 3:28, Ephesians 2:11-22). The apostle James writes that faith without works is dead, and he specifically calls out the mistreatment of the poor and vulnerable as a manifestation of faithlessness (James 2:14-26).\n\nEconomic inequality is another theme that runs throughout the Bible. The biblical text critiques systems of economic oppression and emphasizes the importance of economic justice. For example, the law codes in Leviticus and Deuteronomy include provisions for the redistribution of wealth, such as the Jubilee year, which involves the release of slaves and the return of land to its original owners (Leviticus 25:8-55). The prophets condemn the exploitation of the poor by the wealthy, and Jesus teaches that it is harder for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle (Matthew 19:23-26).\n\nSome Christians may view these issues as distractions from evangelism, arguing that the gospel is primarily about individual salvation and that social justice concerns are secondary or even tangential. However, this perspective neglects the biblical emphasis on the interconnectedness of faith and practice. The gospel is not just about saving individual souls; it's also about inaugurating a new community, the church, which is characterized by love, justice, and righteousness (Matthew 25:31-46).\n\nIn fact, many Christian theologians and traditions have long recognized that social justice and evangelism are intertwined. The Lausanne Covenant, a influential evangelical statement, affirms that \"evangelism and socio-political involvement are both part of our Christian duty\" (§5). Similarly, the black church tradition has long emphasized the connection between faith and justice, highlighting the ways in which the gospel speaks to issues of systemic racism and economic inequality.\n\nOther Christian perspectives, however, may place a greater emphasis on individual salvation and view social justice as a secondary concern. Some may argue that the primary focus of the church should be on proclaiming the gospel and saving souls, rather than addressing social justice issues. While this perspective is valid, it is not necessarily in tension with the idea that social justice is an important aspect of the Christian faith.\n\nIn response to this perspective, it is worth noting that the Bible does not pit evangelism against social justice. Rather, the biblical text presents a holistic understanding of salvation that encompasses both individual and societal transformation. The gospel is not just about saving individuals from their sins; it's also about restoring creation, redeeming communities, and inaugurating a new heaven and a new earth (Revelation 21:1-4).\n\nIn conclusion, the Bible teaches that social justice, systemic racism, and economic inequality are deeply connected to the gospel. These issues are not mere distractions from evangelism, but rather are integral to the Christian faith. As Christians, we are called to proclaim the good news of the kingdom, to care for the vulnerable, and to work towards a more just and equitable society. By engaging with these issues, we are not diverting attention from the gospel; we are, in fact, living out its implications and pointing to the coming kingdom, where God's justice and righteousness will be fully realized.",

It explicitly frames evangelism and social action as interconnected and cites diverse viewpoints, suggesting a willingness to engage with revisionist emphasis without fully abandoning biblical authority.

This signals a clear progressive stance that social justice is central to Christian faith rather than optional. It also acknowledges disagreement by noting that some Christians view social justice as distractions or secondary, and it explicitly states that such perspectives are valid while offering counterarguments. It presents alternative views (emphasizing evangelism, individual salvation, or prioritizing preaching) and argues that the Bible supports a holistic salvation that includes both personal and societal transformation. The tone is confident and persuasive but not dogmatic; it uses qualifiers like “Some Christians may…” and “in response to this perspective…,” indicating a willingness to engage with differing viewpoints rather than insisting on a single unchallengeable position."
