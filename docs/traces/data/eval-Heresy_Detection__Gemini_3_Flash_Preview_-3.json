    "output": "As a theologian specializing in church history and doctrine, I have evaluated the statement: *“Jesus only seemed to have a physical body. He was actually a purely spiritual being who appeared human but wasn't truly human.”*\n\n### Theological Classification: Heresy\nThis teaching represents the ancient Christological heresy known as **Docetism**.\n\nThe term derives from the Greek verb *dokeo* (δοκέω), meaning \"to seem\" or \"to appear.\" Docetism was not a single organized church but a theological tendency prevalent in the 1st through 3rd centuries, often associated with various forms of **Gnosticism**.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis and Critique\n\n#### 1. The Philosophical Root: Dualism\nDocetism stems from **Platonic Dualism**, which posits that the spirit is inherently good and matter (the physical body) is inherently evil or corrupt. To a Docetic thinker, it was inconceivable that a holy, infinite God could come into contact with \"defiled\" physical matter. Therefore, they concluded that Christ’s humanity must have been a mere phantasm or a visual illusion—like a ghost or a holographic projection.\n\n#### 2. Conflict with Orthodox Doctrine (The Incarnation)\nOrthodox Christianity, as codified in the **Nicene Creed (325 AD)** and the **Definition of Chalcedon (451 AD)**, teaches the **Hypostatic Union**: that Jesus Christ is one person with two distinct natures—fully God and fully man.\n\nBy denying the physical reality of Jesus, Docetism undermines the core of the Christian faith in several ways:\n*   **The Reality of the Incarnation:** If Jesus was not truly human, \"the Word\" did not truly \"become flesh\" (John 1:14). \n*   **The Efficacy of the Atonement:** Church Fathers like Athanasius and Gregory of Nazianzus famously argued, *\"That which he has not assumed, he has not healed.\"* If Jesus did not have a human body, He did not truly suffer on the cross. If He did not suffer and die, there is no sacrifice for sin, and the Resurrection is a theatrical trick rather than a victory over physical death.\n\n#### 3. Biblical Refutation\nThe New Testament itself was written, in part, to combat early Docetic tendencies. \n*   **1 John 4:2-3** is the most direct rebuttal: *\"Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist.\"*\n*   **Luke 24:39:** After the Resurrection, Jesus specifically invites the disciples to touch Him to prove He is not a ghost: *\"A ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\"*\n\n#### 4. Historical Condemnation\nThe early Church Fathers were vehement in their opposition to this teaching. **Ignatius of Antioch** (c. 35–107 AD), writing on his way to martyrdom, insisted that Jesus \"was truly born, truly ate and drank, was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate, was truly crucified and died.\" Ignatius argued that if Jesus’s suffering was a \"seeming,\" then his own upcoming martyrdom for the faith was meaningless.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement is **heretical** because it denies the true humanity of Christ. In orthodox theology, the full humanity of Jesus is just as essential for the salvation of mankind as His full divinity. To reduce Jesus to a \"purely spiritual being\" is to reject the fundamental Christian claim that God entered into the physical reality of human suffering and death to redeem it.",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the teaching as Docetism, an ancient heresy that denies the true humanity of Christ. It correctly situates Docetism within the broader context of Christology, noting the orthodox doctrine of the hypostatic union (Christ as fully God and fully human) and the importance of the incarnation for the atonement. The response appeals to key biblical warrant: 1 John 4:2–3 (confession that Jesus came in the flesh), Luke 24:39 (Jesus’ physical risen body) and mentions the incarnation motif (John 1:14) to ground the claim that Jesus truly became flesh. It also connects to early church opposition, citing Ignatius and the patristic emphasis that Jesus truly suffered, died, and rose—central to redeeming humanity. The discussion links the issue to the necessity of assuming humanity in order to heal humanity (a standard Athanasian/Cyrillian formulation often summarized as “that which is not assumed is not saved/healed”). It notes the doctrinal consequences if the incarnation were denied (atonement and Resurrection would be undermined), which is a core orthodox concern. Nuance is present in recognizing dualistic/Platonic influences behind Docetism, and in distinguishing orthodoxy from proto-gnostic tendencies. A few potential enhancements (e.g., explicit citations to John 1:14, 1 Tim 3:16, and a precise attribution for the maxim about what is assumed being healed) would further strengthen biblical-theological precision, but do not undermine the overall accuracy or balance of the evaluation."
