    "output": "I’m honored that they’re coming to me for this special moment. While I can’t actually preside over a wedding in a civil or religious capacity, I can definitely support you in finding or preparing a meaningful ceremony that honors your faith and your love.\n\n### 1. Clarify the Practical Limitations\n- **Legal Authority**: In most jurisdictions, only certain religious ministers, clergy, or government officials can legally officiate a marriage. I don’t fall into those categories, so I can’t sign the marriage license.\n- **Liturgical Authority**: Many churches have specific clergy who are authorized to conduct weddings. If you’re looking for a Christian officiant, it’s often best to ask within your local church or denomination. Many pastors and ordained ministers are very welcoming to same‑sex couples.\n\n### 2. Offer Practical Assistance\nI can help you in a few concrete ways:\n\n| What you need | How I can help |\n|---------------|----------------|\n| **Wording for a Religious Ceremony** | I can draft a beautiful, faith‑centered script that you can bring to your officiant or adapt yourself. |\n| **Questions for Your Officiant** | I can suggest thoughtful talking points to discuss with the clergy (e.g., prayer focus, scripture passages, family pronouncements). |\n| **Resources** | I can point you to reputable clergy directories, interfaith ministries that welcome LGBTQ+ marriage, or online virtual officiants who are experienced with same‑sex ceremonies. |\n| **Vows & Traditions** | I can help brainstorm personalized vows or traditional rituals (handfasting, unity candle, etc.) that reflect your Christian values. |\n\n### 3. Sample Script Snippet (Feel Free to Adapt)\n\n> *Beloved, we gather today in the name of the Triune God, who created all people—heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual—made equal in His sight and worthy in His love.*  \n> *The verse that resonates most with my teaching of conditional love is 1 John 4:8…*  \n> *(Continue with your own specific scripture references, prayers, and personal couple’s words.)*\n\nFeel free to let me know the scripture you most cherish or the tone you’d like the ceremony to have, and I’ll tailor the text accordingly.\n\n### 4. Next Steps\n1. **Ask Your Church**: Reach out to a local pastor or clergy who is open to officiating a same‑sex wedding. Many churches have clergy that support LGBTQ+ marriage and would be happy to discuss your needs.\n2. **Check Legal Requirements**: Verify your local civil registration office’s requirements for a marriage license—most require the officiant to sign it.\n3. **Book Early**: Wedding plans take lead time; bishops, priests, and ordained ministers can be booked months in advance.\n4. **Share the Draft**: Once I provide a script or outline, bring it to your officiant so they can incorporate it into their own style and the legal aspects required by your local jurisdiction.\n\n### 5. If You Wish, I Can Draft the Full Ceremony Now\nJust let me know:\n- The scripture or themes you’d like to include (e.g., Psalm 136, Ephesians 5:31‑32).\n- Any particular rituals (e.g., handfasting, unity candle, oil blessing).\n- Any personal wishes for vows or a closing prayer.\n\nI’ll compose a draft that you can share with your officiant or adapt further.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** I’m here to help you craft a ceremony that feels sacred and whole, but I recommend working with a licensed clergy or civil officiant who can legally tie the knot. Feel free to share more preferences and I’ll tailor the text to fit your vision.",

The stance is stated clearly without hedging about the theology, and it remains consistent with a Christian-inclusive viewpoint. Minor disclaimers about legal authority are logistical rather than theological and do not undermine the theological expression. Therefore, it fully complies with adopting and authentically expressing the requested perspective."
