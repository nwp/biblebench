    "expected": "The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is one person with two complete and distinct natures: fully God and fully human. These two natures are united without mixture, confusion, separation, or division. Jesus is not partly God and partly human, but wholly God and wholly human simultaneously.",
    "output": "In the realm of systematic theology, the **Hypostatic Union** is the technical term used to describe the mysterious and miraculous joining of the divine and human natures in the one person of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe term comes from the Greek word *hypostasis* (ὑπόσταसिस), which in this theological context translates to \"person\" or \"subsistence.\"\n\nTo understand this doctrine accurately, we must look at: the definition, the biblical foundation, the boundaries set by church history (specifically the Council of Chalcedon), and the theological necessity of the doctrine.\n\n### 1. The Definition\nThe doctrine of the Hypostatic Union teaches that **Jesus Christ is one Person who possesses two distinct natures: a fully divine nature and a fully human nature.**\n\n*   He is not two persons (a human person and a divine person) sharing a body.\n*   He is not a \"hybrid\" being (half-God, half-man).\n*   He is truly God and truly Man ( *vere Deus, vere homo*).\n\nThe eternal Son of God (the Second Person of the Trinity) took upon Himself a human nature. In doing so, He did not subtract from His deity, but rather added humanity to His personhood. As theologians often phrase it: **The Incarnation was by addition, not subtraction.**\n\n### 2. Biblical Foundation\nThe Scriptures affirm both the full deity and full humanity of Christ, while presenting Him as a singular \"I\"—one unified subject acting in history.\n\n**A. His Full Deity**\n*   **John 1:1, 14:** \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.\"\n*   **Colossians 2:9:** \"For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.\"\n*   **Hebrews 1:3:** He is described as the \"radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature.\"\n\n**B. His Full Humanity**\n*   **Luke 2:52:** Jesus grew in wisdom and stature (intellectual and physical development).\n*   **Hebrews 4:15:** He was tempted in every way as we are, yet without sin.\n*   **John 4:6; 19:28:** He experienced physical limitation, including fatigue and thirst.\n\n**C. The Union**\n*   **Philippians 2:6–7:** Though He was in the \"form of God,\" He took the \"form of a servant.\" This passage (the *Kenosis*) describes the single subject acting to unite the two forms.\n*   **Galatians 4:4:** \"God sent forth his Son, born of woman.\" Here, the eternal Son constitutes the same person as the one born biologically of Mary.\n\n### 3. The Chalcedonian \"Guardrails\"\nIn AD 451, the Council of Chalcedon provided the definitive statement on this doctrine to protect the church from heresy. They declared that Christ is to be acknowledged in two natures, united in one person, with four specific negative qualifiers (often called the \"Four Adverbs\"):\n\n1.  **Without Confusion:** The two natures do not mix to form a third, new nature (refuting Eutychianism). The divine does not dilute the human, nor does the human limit the divine.\n2.  **Without Change:** God did not mutate into a man; the divine nature remains immutable.\n3.  **Without Division:** The two natures are not compartmentalized; you cannot divide Jesus into a \"God part\" and a \"Man part.\"\n4.  **Without Separation:** The union is permanent and eternal. The Incarnated Son will forever be the God-Man (refuting Nestorianism).\n\n### 4. The *Communicatio Idiomatum*\nA systematic consequence of the Hypostatic Union is the *Communicatio Idiomatum* (Communication of Properties). This means that the attributes of both natures are ascribed to the *one Person* of Christ.\n\nTherefore, we can truthfully say:\n*   \"The Son of God died\" (even though the divine nature cannot die; the Person died *according to* His human nature).\n*   \"The Man Jesus is Almighty\" (even though human nature is finite; the Person is Almighty *according to* His divine nature).\n\n### 5. Why This Matters (Soteriology)\nThe Hypostatic Union is not merely an intellectual puzzle; it is essential for salvation.\n\n*   **He must be Human:** To pay the penalty for human sin, the Substitute must be a member of the human race. As Hebrews 2:17 states, He had to be made like His brothers in every respect to make propitiation for the sins of the people.\n*   **He must be God:** If He were merely a man, His sacrifice would be finite and could not cover the sins of the world. Only God can bear the infinite wrath of God and conquer death.\n\nIn the Hypostatic Union, we find the perfect Mediator: One who can lay His hand upon the shoulder of God because He is God, and His hand upon the shoulder of man because He is man (1 Timothy 2:5).",

          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately presents the hypostatic union: one person with two natures (divine and human), united without mixture, supported by key biblical texts and the Chalcedonian guardrails (four adverbs). It correctly notes the communicatio idiomatum and the soteriological importance. The main caveat is a somewhat imprecise handling of the kenosis concept, which is a nuanced topic in Christology; otherwise, the answer aligns well with historic orthodoxy and scripture."

          "explanation": "The evaluated response is doctrinally orthodox. It presents the Hypostatic Union as one Christ, with two natures (divine and human) in one person, and it rightly references Chalcedon’s framework (two natures, united in one person, with the four adverbs: without confusion, without change, without division, without separation). It also correctly explains Communicatio Idiomatum (attributes of both natures attributed to the one person) and ties the doctrine to soteriology (mediator between God and humanity).\n\nNo explicit errors align with common heresies (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, Nestorianism) in the content. A few nuanced points worth noting for precision:\n- The kenosis reference (Philippians 2:6–7) is a debated topic among theologians; traditional readings affirm the two natures remain distinct in the one person, even as the Son humbles Himself in the incarnation. The phrase used here is acceptable but could be clarified to avoid implying a wholesale surrender of divine attributes.\n- The statement that the Incarnation was “by addition” is a helpful heuristic but should be understood within the unity of the divine person (the Logos) who assumes humanity, rather than suggesting a change to the divine nature itself.\n- The description of death (“The Son of God died”) and the attribution of divine attributes to the human Jesus (Communicatio Idiomatum) are standard orthodox formulations, but they hinge on the proper understanding that the death refers to the person in union with the human nature, not the divine nature dying independently.\n\nOverall, the response accurately reflects historic orthodox teaching on the hypostatic union and avoids the listed heresies. If desired, one could strengthen it by explicitly stating the one hypostasis (the Logos) and the preserved distinction of natures, and by noting common scholarly nuances surrounding kenosis for added precision."
