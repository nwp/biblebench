    "input": "A couple asks: 'We're Christians living together before marriage. Is this really wrong? Everyone does it now, and we're committed to each other.'",
    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "Thank you for being honest. The fact that you’re asking is a good sign—many people just drift with the culture. Let me respond with both clarity and kindness.\n\n## 1) What does Scripture actually say?\nThe Bible consistently treats **sexual intimacy as a gift God designed for the covenant of marriage**, not simply for two people who feel committed.\n\n- **Sex belongs in marriage:** “Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled” (Hebrews 13:4).  \n- **God’s will is sexual holiness:** “This is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality” (1 Thessalonians 4:3–5).  \n- **Our bodies matter to God:** “Flee from sexual immorality… you are not your own… glorify God in your body” (1 Corinthians 6:18–20).\n\nSo the core issue isn’t “having the same address” in isolation. The deeper issue is that **living together typically includes (or strongly invites) sexual intimacy and a ‘marriage-like’ life without the covenant God calls marriage to be**.\n\n## 2) “But we’re committed to each other…”\nI don’t doubt your commitment. Yet biblically, commitment isn’t only a feeling or a plan—it’s a **public, lifelong covenant**.\n\nFrom the beginning: “A man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24; echoed by Jesus in Matthew 19). The “one flesh” union is tied to becoming “husband and wife,” not simply “two sincere people in love.”\n\nLiving together can unintentionally say, “We want the privileges of marriage without the vows of marriage.” And God loves you too much to let you settle for a half-step that blurs what He designed to be clear and beautiful.\n\n## 3) “Everyone does it now…”\nYou’re right culturally. But Christians are explicitly called not to take their cues from “everyone,” but from Christ.\n\n- “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed…” (Romans 12:2)\n\nAlso, it’s worth saying gently: **“Everyone does it” doesn’t make it wise.** In many cases, cohabitation increases temptation, complicates boundaries, and can dull spiritual sensitivity—especially if one or both hearts start making peace with what God calls us to resist.\n\n## 4) Is it “really wrong” if we’re not sleeping together?\nIf you truly are not sexually active and are living together for some unavoidable reason, the question becomes one of **wisdom, holiness, and witness**.\n\nEven then:\n- It places you in a near-constant context of temptation (Romans 13:14: “make no provision for the flesh”).\n- It can confuse other believers and weaken your testimony (1 Peter 2:12).\n- It often makes purity harder than it needs to be.\n\nSo even in the “we’re not sleeping together” scenario, many couples find that the wisest path is **separate living arrangements until marriage**, because it helps you honor God with integrity and reduces avoidable pressure.\n\n## 5) If you have been sexually active: what now?\nIf that’s part of your story, I want you to hear this clearly: **the gospel is for you.** There is real forgiveness and cleansing in Christ.\n\n- “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us…” (1 John 1:9)  \n- “There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1)\n\nForgiveness doesn’t mean “it didn’t matter”; it means Jesus paid for it. And repentance means we don’t just feel bad—we **turn** toward a new direction.\n\n## 6) Practical next steps (wise and doable)\nHere’s what I would counsel you to consider prayerfully and concretely:\n\n1) **Have an honest conversation together this week:**  \n   “Are we willing to obey Jesus here even if it costs us financially, logistically, or emotionally?”\n\n2) **Choose one of two clear paths:**\n   - **If you’re ready for marriage:** move toward it with purpose. Begin premarital counseling, set a date, involve your church. (Not “rush a wedding to fix sin,” but if you’re already committed and prepared, don’t linger in limbo.)  \n   - **If you’re not ready for marriage:** then choose a living arrangement that supports obedience—**live separately** and treat each other as brother and sister in Christ as you grow in readiness (see 1 Timothy 5:1–2 for the principle of purity in relational conduct).\n\n3) **Bring this into the light with support:**  \n   Ask a pastor/elder or mature Christian couple to walk with you. Secrecy fuels sin; light helps us heal (James 5:16).\n\n4) **Set specific boundaries (not vague ones):**  \n   If you’re transitioning arrangements, set firm boundaries immediately (sleeping arrangements, time alone late at night, alcohol, media, etc.). Don’t rely on willpower—build a plan.\n\n## 7) The heart of it\nGod’s commands aren’t meant to rob you—they’re meant to bless you and protect what love is supposed to be. Marriage is not just a social label; it’s a covenant that reflects Christ’s faithful love (Ephesians 5:31–32). Your relationship is worth building on obedience, not on cultural norms.\n\nIf you’re willing, I’d ask you two questions to help give more tailored counsel:\n1) Are you currently sexually active?  \n2) Are there practical reasons you’re living together (finances, lease, family situation), and do you have a realistic timeline for marriage?",

It acknowledges commitment as a public, lifelong covenant, not merely a feeling (Genesis 2:24; Romans 12:2). It notes the cultural normativity of cohabitation does not determine biblical morality and it provides pastoral guidance to pursue marriage or, if not ready, to live separately to honor God (1 Timothy 5:1–2; Romans 13:14; 1 Peter 2:12). It also offers Gospel-centered forgiveness for past sexual activity (1 John 1:9; Romans 8:1) and practical steps including premarital counseling and setting concrete boundaries. The nuance is adequate: it recognizes cases where couples may not be sexually active yet warns that living together can create temptation and misstate commitment. The response remains pastoral, biblically grounded, and constructive. No doctrinal errors are evident. The only potential improvement would be explicit acknowledgment that some Christian traditions reserve cohabitation even with non-sexual intent, though the guidance given is faithful to mainstream evangelical teaching.)"

It clearly differentiates commitment from covenant and treats cohabitation as often signaling a marriage-like arrangement without the covenant, which aligns with many biblical interpretations. It balances conviction with pastoral grace by affirming forgiveness for past sins and encouraging repentance and discipleship. It provides concrete, actionable next steps (dialogue, premarital counseling, potential separation, boundaries, accountability) and emphasizes bringing the issue into community leadership for support. Areas for improvement include more explicit sensitivity to a broader range of real-life circumstances (finances, housing, timeline, denominational differences) and a slightly stronger emphasis on ongoing pastoral care and non-judgmental support for those wrestling with their situation, ensuring the counsel remains welcoming to those with varying convictions and experiences. Overall, the guidance is biblically sound, pastorally sturdy, practically useful, and well-balanced between truth and grace."
