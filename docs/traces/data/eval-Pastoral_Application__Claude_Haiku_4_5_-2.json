    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "# A Pastoral Response\n\nI appreciate your honesty, and I want to address this with both love and clarity, because I care about your spiritual wellbeing.\n\n## What Scripture Teaches\n\nThe Bible consistently calls us away from sexual relationships outside of marriage. Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 6:18, \"Flee from sexual immorality,\" and in 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4, \"It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your body in a way that is holy and honorable.\"\n\nThis isn't arbitrary rule-making. God designed sexuality for the covenant commitment of marriage—where there's the deepest security, permanence, and witness.\n\n## Why \"Everyone Does It\" Matters Less Than We Think\n\nCultural prevalence doesn't change God's design. Every generation faces pressure to redefine biblical boundaries. Our job isn't to conform Christianity to culture, but to let Christ conform us to His kingdom's values—even when countercultural.\n\n## The Real Question\n\nRather than focusing on what's \"technically\" wrong, I'd ask: **What are you protecting by living together?** Often the answer reveals something important. Are you:\n\n- Testing compatibility? (Marriage itself is the test of commitment)\n- Afraid of commitment while claiming commitment? (This tension matters)\n- Seeking financial security? (There are other solutions)\n- Responding to cultural pressure? (This deserves honest examination)\n\n## What I'd Encourage\n\n**Consider moving apart** before marriage. This isn't punishment—it's:\n\n- **Honoring God's design** at the cost of real sacrifice, which deepens faith\n- **Protecting your relationship** from patterns that compromise intimacy and trust\n- **Demonstrating** that your commitment is to Christ first, each other second\n- **Building character** in both of you around self-control and delayed gratification\n\nYes, it's harder. Yes, it's countercultural. But **that's often the mark of genuine discipleship.**\n\n## Moving Forward\n\nIf you marry, you'll want a marriage built on obedience to Christ, not compromise. The easiest path now often creates the hardest marriage later—resentment, spiritual distance, questions about whose values actually guide your home.\n\nI'm here to support you in whatever you decide. But I'd be unfaithful as your pastor if I pretended Scripture supports this arrangement, or if I let cultural accommodation substitute for loving truth.\n\n**What would it look like for you to trust God here?**",

          "rationale": "The response aligns with biblical sexual ethics: sex is presented as appropriate only within the covenant of marriage, supported by scriptural cues such as flee from sexual immorality (1 Cor 6:18) and the call to sanctification and self-control (1 Thessalonians 4:3-4). It emphasizes that cultural norms do not redefine God’s design and that true commitment is oriented toward Christ and marriage. The pastoral approach is balanced, offering compassionate guidance while clearly upholding doctrinal standards, and it includes diagnostic questions about motives and practical steps (consider separating or pursuing biblical marriage) that reflect mature pastoral care. A minor gap is the lack of explicit citation to additional traditional texts like 1 Cor 6:19-20 (the body as temple) or Heb 13:4, which would strengthen biblical grounding; however, the core teaching remains correct and well supported. The nuance is strong: it acknowledges cultural pressure, differentiates between commitment and covenant, and frames obedience to Christ as central to the decision. "

It provides clear theological rationale for why cohabitation outside marriage is discouraged and frames the issue in terms of discipleship and trust in God. The pastoral tone is warm and caring, acknowledging the couple’s commitment while urging adherence to biblical design. However, the guidance leans toward separation as the primary practical step, which may feel rigid or impractical for some couples; a more nuanced set of options (bounded living, premarital counseling, accountability, and a concrete plan with timelines) would strengthen practical wisdom and potential for a compassionate yet faithful path forward."
