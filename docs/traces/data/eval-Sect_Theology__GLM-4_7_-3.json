    "expected": "LDS theology teaches that Jesus and Lucifer (Satan) are spirit brothers, both created by God the Father in a pre-mortal existence. This is incompatible with orthodox Christianity for several reasons: (1) Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17 says all things were created through him); (2) Jesus is worshiped as God (Hebrews 1:6) while Satan is a fallen angel; (3) This teaching diminishes Christ's unique divine nature and blurs the absolute distinction between the Creator and creation. Orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus as the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity, while Satan is a created angelic being who rebelled.",
    "output": "To understand the theological friction between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) and historic, orthodox Christianity regarding the relationship between Jesus and Lucifer, one must examine the underlying cosmology of both traditions.\n\nFrom the perspective of comparative theology, the divergence stems from fundamentally different views on the nature of God, the origin of existence, and the ontology (the nature of being) of Jesus Christ.\n\n### The Latter-day Saint Perspective\n\nIn LDS theology, the relationship between Jesus and Lucifer is defined by the doctrine of **pre-mortal existence**.\n\n1.  **Pre-Mortal Life:** Latter-day Saints believe that all human beings lived as spirit children of God the Father (Heavenly Father) and a Heavenly Mother before being born on earth. In this state, they were intelligences with distinct personalities.\n2.  **The Eldest and the Second Son:** Within this vast family of spirits, Jesus (known in the pre-mortal realm as Jehovah) was the **firstborn**. This signifies not just a chronological order but a position of preeminence and authority. Lucifer (often referred to as Satan) is understood to be another of these spirit children.\n3.  **Siblings:** Therefore, in a literal, ontological sense, Jesus and Lucifer are spirit brothers. Both were begotten by the Father in the pre-mortal realm.\n4.  **The Council in Heaven:** The conflict arose during a \"Grand Council\" in heaven. The Father presented a plan of salvation centered on agency and the need for a Savior. Jesus volunteered to be the Savior, submitting to the Father’s will. Lucifer, however, proposed an alternative plan that would coerce all humanity to be saved, thereby destroying their agency (free will) and seeking glory for himself.\n5.  **The Result:** Due to his rebellion, Lucifer was cast out of heaven along with those who followed him, becoming Satan.\n\nFor a Latter-day Saint, this narrative emphasizes the reality of agency, the noble nature of pre-mortal life, and Jesus as the exemplary, obedient elder brother who achieves exaltation.\n\n### The Orthodox Christian Perspective\n\nHistoric, orthodox Christianity (encompassing Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism) relies on the biblical canon and the ecumenical creeds (such as the Nicene Creed) to define the relationship between Jesus and Lucifer.\n\n1.  **Creator vs. Creature:** The foundational distinction in orthodoxy is that Jesus is the eternal Creator, and Lucifer is a created creature. There is no ontological \"brotherhood\" because they do not share the same origin or nature.\n2.  **The Eternal Logos:** Orthodox theology holds that Jesus Christ is the eternally begotten Son of God, \"God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God.\" He is *not* a created spirit. He is uncreated and eternal, existing outside of time and creation. (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17).\n3.  **The Nature of Lucifer:** Lucifer (Satan) is traditionally understood as a created angel—a cherub or seraph—of high rank and beauty. However, he is still part of the created order. He is not a \"spirit child\" of God in the same sense humans are, nor is he of the same substance as God.\n4.  **No Kinship:** Because Jesus is God and Lucifer is a created angel, they are of two entirely different categories of being. To call them \"brothers\" is to confuse the Creator with the creation.\n\n### Why this is Problematic for Orthodox Christianity\n\nFrom an orthodox perspective, the LDS teaching that Jesus and Lucifer are spirit brothers is problematic for several critical theological reasons:\n\n**1. The Ontology of Christ (Arianism)**\nThe most significant issue is that implying Jesus and Lucifer share the same origin (as spirit children of the Father) suggests that Jesus is a created being. In the 4th century, the Church condemned the teaching of Arius, who argued that the Son was a created being—the \"first creature\" of God—and not co-eternal and consubstantial (of the same substance) with the Father.\nBy classifying Jesus as the \"eldest spirit brother,\" LDS theology aligns with a view of Christ that orthodoxy considers heretical. It removes the ontological divide between the Creator and the creature. If Jesus is a \"brother\" to other spirits in a species-specific way, He is functionally a superior creature, rather than the Creator of all things (visible and invisible).\n\n**2. Redefining the Nature of God**\nOrthodoxy insists on the \"Creator-Creature distinction.\" There is an infinite qualitative difference between God and everything else. God is self-existent (*aseity*); everything else is contingent.\nThe LDS view blurs this line. If God is the literal Father of spirits in a biological or generative sense, then His nature is of the same order as ours, simply more advanced or exalted. Orthodoxy rejects this, maintaining that God is \"Wholly Other\" in His essence. Calling God and Satan \"brothers\" (even via Jesus) feels to orthodox theologians like a category error, akin to calling a man and a termite \"brothers\" because they were both made by God; the distinction in nature is too vast to permit sibling terminology.\n\n**3. The Nature of Evil**\nIn orthodox theology, evil is not an equal and opposite force to God (dualism). Satan is a corrupted creature who turned away from the Good. He possesses no power except what is permitted by God or what he derives from his created nature. By framing the conflict as a disagreement between two brothers (one proposing salvation, the other proposing coercion), the LDS view risks elevating Satan's status to that of a rival peer of the Son of God, rather than a subordinate subject who rebelled against his Maker.\n\n### Summary of Agreement and Departure\n\n*   **Agreement:** Both traditions agree that Jesus Christ is the preeminent advocate of God’s will and the Savior of humanity, while Lucifer is a rebellious figure who opposes God's plan. Both agree that a cosmic conflict occurred involving these figures.\n*   **Departure:** The departure is absolute in defining the *nature* of Jesus.\n    *   **LDS View:** Jesus is the literal eldest spirit brother of all humans and Lucifer, distinguished by His obedience and divinity bestowed by the Father.\n    *   **Orthodox View:** Jesus is the eternal, uncreated Creator God; Lucifer is a finite, created angel. They are not \"brothers\" in any sense, because one is Infinite God and the other is a fallen creature.\n\nTo the orthodox Christian, the concept of Jesus and Lucifer as brothers undermines the divinity of Christ and collapses the infinite distinction between the Creator and the creation. To the Latter-day Saint, it is a literal depiction of the family structure of the divine plan.",

It is nuanced in acknowledging the overall disagreement and the functional concerns about Christology. However, it attributes LDS Christology to Arius in a way that overgeneralizes Mormon theology, and it includes elements (like Heavenly Mother) that are debated or noncanonical within LDS discourse. A more precise evaluation would avoid equating Mormon theology with a single heresiological label and would note the distinctive Mormon Godhead and soteriology while still articulating orthodox concerns."
