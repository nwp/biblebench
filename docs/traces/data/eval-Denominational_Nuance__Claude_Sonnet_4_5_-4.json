    "expected": "Christians hold various eschatological views: Premillennialism believes Christ returns before a literal thousand-year reign. Postmillennialism expects Christ returns after the church establishes God's kingdom on earth. Amillennialism sees the millennium as symbolic of the current church age. Within premillennialism, pretribulationists believe the rapture precedes tribulation, while post-tribulationists place it after. Preterists see many prophecies as fulfilled in 70 AD. Despite these differences, all orthodox Christians affirm Christ's personal return, final judgment, bodily resurrection, and eternal states of heaven and hell. The timing and details are disputed, but the core hope remains.",
    "output": "# Christian Views on the End Times (Eschatology)\n\nChristians universally affirm certain core beliefs about the end times based on the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds: Christ will return bodily, there will be a resurrection and final judgment, and God will establish His eternal kingdom. However, they differ significantly on the timing and sequence of these events.\n\n## Major Eschatological Frameworks\n\n### **Premillennialism**\nChrist returns *before* a literal 1,000-year reign on earth (Revelation 20).\n\n- **Historic Premillennialism**: Christ returns, resurrects believers, judges the world, then establishes His millennial kingdom. Common among early church fathers and many evangelicals today.\n\n- **Dispensational Premillennialism**: Features a pre-tribulation rapture where the church is removed before a 7-year tribulation, followed by Christ's return and millennial reign. Distinguishes between God's plan for Israel and the church. Popular in many Baptist, Pentecostal, and non-denominational churches.\n\n### **Amillennialism**\nThe \"millennium\" is symbolic of the current church age between Christ's first and second comings. Satan is currently bound in a limited sense. Christ returns once to judge and establish the eternal state. Held by many Reformed, Lutheran, and Eastern Orthodox traditions.\n\n### **Postmillennialism**\nThe gospel gradually transforms the world, creating a \"golden age\" of Christian influence before Christ's return. Emphasizes the church's victory through faithful witness. Found among some Reformed and reconstructionist theologians.\n\n## Key Points of Difference\n\n**The Rapture**: \n- Pretribulationism: Church removed before tribulation\n- Midtribulationism: Church removed mid-tribulation\n- Posttribulationism: Church remains through tribulation\n- Amillennialism/Postmillennialism: Generally reject a separate rapture event\n\n**Israel and the Church**:\n- Dispensationalists see distinct roles for ethnic Israel in prophecy\n- Covenant theologians see the church as the fulfillment of Israel's promises\n\n**Interpretive Approach**:\n- Literal interpretation of prophetic texts (common in dispensationalism)\n- Symbolic/apocalyptic genre interpretation (common in amillennialism)\n\n## Areas of Agreement\n\nDespite these differences, orthodox Christians agree on:\n- Christ's personal, visible, bodily return\n- Bodily resurrection of the dead\n- Final judgment of all people\n- New heavens and new earth\n- Eternal punishment and eternal life\n- The ultimate victory of God's kingdom\n\n## Pastoral Perspective\n\nThese differing views have coexisted within orthodoxy for centuries. Christians should hold their eschatological positions with conviction while extending grace to those with different understandings, focusing on our shared hope in Christ's return and our call to faithful living and witness in the present.",

It is generally aligned with historic Christian orthodoxy and scripture-grounded in its broad strokes. However, it omits Preterism (a significant eschatological position among Christians who view many prophecies as fulfilled in 70 AD), and it makes a nuanced claim about historic premillennialism’s historical prevalence that is debatable. It also simplifies covenant theology’s view of Israel and the church without detailing nuanced positions within that tradition. Overall, the answer is solid but not fully comprehensive and includes arguable historical assertions."

However, it tends to emphasize dispensational premillennialism as prevalent in Protestant evangelical circles (notably Baptist, Pentecostal, and non-denominational groups) and frames Israel-vs-church and literal vs. symbolic hermeneutics in ways that strongly align with that tradition. It also omits explicit Catholic perspectives and deeper engagement with some non-Protestant traditions, signaling a modest Protestant-evangelical tilt alongside overall balance."
