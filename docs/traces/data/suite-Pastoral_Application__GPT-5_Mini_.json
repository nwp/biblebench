        "input": "A church member asks: 'My teenage daughter just told me she's questioning her faith and doesn't know if she believes in God anymore. I'm devastated and scared. What should I do?'",
        "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
        "output": "First, I’m so sorry—you’re hurting, and a response like this can feel like the ground shifting beneath you. You’re not alone in this. Many parents have walked this road. Let me offer a biblically rooted, pastoral, and practical way forward.\n\nA few theological anchors to hold to\n- God sees and loves your daughter. Psalm 139 reminds us God knows her intimately—her thoughts, questions, and struggles. Nothing about her is unknown or wasted.\n- Jesus meets doubters with compassion, not condemnation. Think of the Samaritan woman (John 4) and Thomas (John 20:24–29). Jesus welcomed their questions and didn’t shame them for honesty.\n- God is at work in ways we don’t always see. Trust his sovereignty (Romans 8:28) while also praying and acting faithfully (James 1:5; Philippians 4:6–7).\n\nHow to respond in the moment (what to say and not say)\n- Say: “Thank you for telling me. I love you and I’m glad you felt safe enough to be honest.” That communicates love and safety above argument.\n- Ask gentle, open questions: “Can you tell me more about what’s making you doubt?” “Is this more intellectual questions, or something you’ve experienced that’s hurting you?” “How long have you been feeling this way?”\n- Don’t lecture, panic, or punish. Avoid immediate attempts to “fix” with heavy arguments, guilt (“you’ll go to hell”), or pressure. Those responses push kids away.\n- Don’t assume failure. Doubt is often part of growing faith and can lead to deeper trust in God if handled with grace.\n\nPractical next steps (a plan you can follow)\n1. Create a safe space to keep talking\n   - Schedule regular low-pressure time together—walks, coffee, car rides—where she can speak honestly without fear of immediate correction.\n2. Listen more than you speak\n   - Validate feelings: “I hear you. That must be confusing/uncertain/hard.” Listening shows you value her person more than her answers.\n3. Share your story, not just arguments\n   - Briefly tell how you came to faith and moments you wrestled. Personal testimony invites connection more than debate.\n4. Ask what kind of help she wants\n   - Some teens want honest conversation; others want space. Ask: “Would you like to explore some things together? Would you prefer I give you space?”\n5. Invite exploration rather than force conclusions\n   - Offer to read or watch things together (videos, books), visit a youth group, or meet with a trusted youth leader or mentor who listens well.\n6. Provide thoughtful resources (age-appropriate)\n   - For intellectual questions: Tim Keller’s The Reason for God, Lee Strobel’s The Case for Christ (teen adaptations exist), C.S. Lewis (Mere Christianity). For faith and doubt: Philip Yancey’s Where Is God When It Hurts? or theologians who model wrestling in faith.\n   - For younger teens, look for youth-oriented apologetics or a patient mentor.\n7. Involve the church community wisely\n   - Connect her with a warm, nonjudgmental youth pastor, small group, or mature believer who can relate and answer questions. Don’t parachute her into confrontational apologetics groups.\n8. Watch for deeper issues\n   - If doubt is tied to depression, trauma, or abuse, seek professional counseling. Mental health can profoundly affect beliefs and must be treated with care.\n9. Keep praying and trusting God\n   - Pray specifically for wisdom (James 1:5), for her heart (Romans 8:38–39), and for you to love well. Remember Matthew 7:7–8—God honors seekers.\n10. Care for yourself\n   - Your devastation and fear are real. Talk with a pastor or a trusted Christian friend, and don’t pour out your fear in ways that guilt or control her.\n\nScriptures you might quietly keep returning to (read and pray)\n- Psalm 139:1–18 (God knows her)\n- John 6:37; John 6:44 and John 6:65 — balance God’s drawing with his welcoming heart\n- John 4 (Samaritan woman) and John 20:24–29 (Thomas) — Jesus’ posture toward questions\n- Romans 8:28–39 (God’s love and sovereign work)\n- James 1:5 (ask God for wisdom)\n- Philippians 4:6–7 (peace for anxious hearts)\n\nExamples of things you could say to your daughter\n- “I’m sad because I love you and want what’s best, but I’m also grateful you told me the truth. Would you help me understand what’s changed?”\n- “I don’t want to lecture you. I want to walk with you. Would you like me to listen, or would you like me to share what I believe and why?”\n- “If you want, we can explore these questions together. If you’d rather meet with someone else, I can help find someone who’ll listen.”\n\nA pastoral caution\n- Don’t weaponize Scripture or fear. Threats of punishment or eternal doom are rarely helpful and often harden hearts. We’re called to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15).\n- Don’t rush. Genuine faith often survives honest questioning. Pressure and shame often push people away permanently.\n\nFinally, hope\nDoubt is not the end of faith—sometimes it’s the way to a deeper faith. God has welcomed seekers, and he is not surprised. Keep loving, keep praying, keep listening. If you’d like, I’m here to pray with you, talk further, meet with your daughter (if she’s open), or help connect you with resources or a trusted counselor or youth leader.\n\nWould you like a short list of recommended books and videos for teens and parents, or would you prefer help setting up a meeting with a youth leader or counselor?",

It emphasizes that doubt can be a normal part of faith development, the compassionate posture of Jesus toward those who question, and the supremacy of God’s love and sovereignty. It grounds its guidance in Scripture (Psalms about God knowing us; John 4 and John 20 for Jesus’ compassionate engagement with questions; Romans 8 and James 1:5; Philippians 4:6–7) and references the call to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). It also offers practical, pastorally sensitive steps: listening, sharing personal testimony, inviting exploration, involving wise mentors, ensuring mental health considerations, and praying. Nuance is well-captured: it cautions against shaming, guilt, or fear-based tactics; it distinguishes between intellectual questions and experiential hurt; it advises a gradual, patient approach and appropriate church support, rather than coercive apologetics. Minor potential omissions are not doctrinal errors: the text does not explicitly echo the exact phrasing of 1 Peter 3:15, and it cites different scripture (e.g., Ephesians 4:15) to support “truth in love.” It also doesn’t overtly frame gratitude to God for the daughter’s honesty, though it does emphasize safe, loving communication. Overall, the response is biblically grounded, theologically Sound, and nuanced, with only minor stylistic divergences from the exact expected phrasing.}"

        "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
        "output": "Thank you for trusting me with this question. First and most importantly: yes — you can be a Christian and experience same-sex attraction. And no — God does not hate you.\n\nWhat Scripture says about you\n- God’s love for you is deep, personal, and not withdrawn because of your feelings. “We love because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19); “For God so loved the world…” (John 3:16). Romans 8:38–39 says nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ.\n- You are known and treasured by God. Psalm 139 reminds us that God knitted you together and knows you intimately. He meets us in our weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n- The gospel is for sinners — not for those who are already perfect. Romans 5:8: “While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Being forgiven and reconciled to God is based on Christ’s work, not on having the “right” feelings.\n\nA biblical distinction that helps\n- There is a difference between temptation, inclination, and willful sin. Experiencing attraction is not the same as acting on every desire. Jesus was tempted (Hebrews 4:15) but did not sin. Paul describes his own inward struggle with desires in Romans 7 — honest struggle does not disqualify a person from Christ.\n- The Bible teaches that sexual union belongs within the covenant of marriage (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6). Sexual activity outside of God’s design (including same-sex sexual behavior) is treated in Scripture as wrongdoing that needs forgiveness and change — as with other sins (1 Corinthians 6:9–11). But that teaching about sexual ethics does not mean God hates the person who experiences same-sex attraction.\n\nHow I want you to hear this pastorally\n- You are not an outcast to God. He loves you. He is for you, not against you (Romans 8:31).\n- You are not defined first by your attractions; you are defined by being a child of God, a bearer of his image, and — if you have trusted Christ — a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n- Your struggle can be an honest place to bring to God, to trusted brothers and sisters, and to wise counsel. Hiding and isolation make hard things harder; honest community makes healing and holy change possible (James 5:16).\n\nPractical, loving next steps\n- Keep coming to Jesus. Read Scripture, pray, and receive the means of grace the church offers — worship, the Lord’s Supper, fellowship. These are where God shapes us.\n- Find a safe, trusting Christian friend, mentor, or pastor you can be honest with. Accountability and prayer partners are a great help.\n- Seek a biblically faithful counselor or pastor who can help you process your attractions, your yearnings, and practical ways to live faithfully. Professional help (for trauma, depression, loneliness) can also be appropriate.\n- Set wise boundaries (online, social, relational) that protect your heart and help you avoid acting on temptations. Replace loneliness with healthy friendships and service.\n- Practice pursuing holiness, not by shame, but by grace: “Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh” (Galatians 5:16). Growth often happens slowly and with setbacks — God’s patience and mercy cover that.\n\nA brief word about shame\nShame says, “You are unacceptable.” The gospel says, “You are loved, forgiven, and being remade.” If you feel condemned, come to Christ — Romans 8:1: “There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” Confess honestly, receive forgiveness (1 John 1:9), and walk on in obedience sustained by grace.\n\nWould you like me to pray with you? Or help you find a local pastor/church or a counselor who holds to the historic Christian sexual ethic and can walk alongside you? I’m here to help — you don’t have to carry this alone.",

That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
        "output": "Thank you for asking this honestly — I know it can be hard to bring this up. Let me first say: I care about you both, I’m glad you want to think biblically about your situation, and I want to speak truth with compassion. What follows is not meant to shame but to help you see God’s heart and give practical steps forward.\n\n1) What the Bible teaches\n- God’s design for sexual intimacy is given within the covenant of marriage. Genesis 2:24 pictures the joining of husband and wife as a unique, lifelong union; Jesus affirms marriage as God’s intention (Matthew 19:4–6). The Song of Solomon celebrates marital sexual intimacy.\n- Sexual purity is commanded for followers of Christ. Paul writes that God’s will for us is sanctification — “to abstain from sexual immorality” (1 Thessalonians 4:3–5). He also warns that our bodies are members of Christ and temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:15–20) and calls followers to flee sexual sin.\n- Marriage is honored in Scripture (Hebrews 13:4) and pictured as the relationship between Christ and the church (Ephesians 5:22–33). Sex is more than emotional or physical; it’s covenantal and sacramental in its relational meaning.\n\n2) Why living together before marriage is more than a neutral choice\n- It often normalizes sexual activity outside God’s covenant, which scripture forbids. Even if you’re “committed,” living together tends to blur the covenantal boundary that marriage is meant to provide.\n- Practically it increases temptation and can harden patterns that are difficult to change later. Many couples tell me that the physical and emotional patterns formed while cohabiting become ingrained and can hinder a healthy transition into a godly marriage.\n- It affects witness. Romans 12:2 calls Christians not to be conformed to the world. When our choices look the same as the world’s, the church’s distinctive call to holiness is less visible.\n- There can be real legal, financial and relational consequences to cohabiting that marriage handles (property, children, family expectations).\n\n3) Grace — God’s mercy and how to move forward\n- If you’re already living together, God’s grace is not exhausted. Confession and repentance are the Gospel’s first steps (1 John 1:9; Luke 15 — the father running to the prodigal). God forgives and restores; He also calls us to change.\n- Repentance does not always mean a dramatic public confession, but it does mean turning from old patterns and taking concrete steps toward obedience.\n\n4) Practical next steps (a plan you can follow)\na. Stop justifying “everyone does it.” Talk honestly together about why you’re living together (convenience, finances, fear of moving out alone, not wanting the wedding expense, etc.) and whether those reasons are worth compromising obedience.\nb. Commit to sexual purity now. If you are sexually active, stop. If you find it very hard to live under the same roof without sexual intimacy, consider changing living arrangements — at least temporarily — until you are married. Sleeping separately or having different schedules is sometimes used, but moving apart is often the clearest and safest way.\nc. Get accountability. Tell a trusted pastor or mature Christian couple and invite them to walk with you, pray, and check in. Accountability is not shame; it’s needed help.\nd. Seek counseling / premarital preparation. If marriage is the next step, pursue marriage intentionally — not as a way to justify current sin, but to enter in for the right reasons. Pre-marriage counseling will surface issues you need to resolve before saying “I do.”\ne. Pray and study Scripture together daily. Ask God to grow you in holiness and make your relationship a mirror of Christ and the church (Ephesians 5).\nf. If there are legitimate reasons you must share a home for a season (financial hardship, health, immigration, safety), be transparent with a church leader and put concrete boundaries and accountability in place — including separate bedrooms and strict limits on physical affection.\n\n5) Some pastoral cautions\n- Don’t rush into marriage merely to legitimize cohabitation. Marriage should be entered for the right reasons and after wise preparation.\n- If either of you is pressured into sexual activity, or there is abuse, you need help immediately. Contact a pastor, counselor, or appropriate authorities.\n\n6) I’m here to help\nIf you’d like, I’ll meet with you (together or individually), pray with you, and help you make a step-by-step plan. We can read Scripture together, work through pre-marital materials, and set up accountability. God is able to forgive and to reshape relationships by His grace — and He calls us to live in ways that honor Him.\n\nShort summary: Yes — Scripture calls sexual intimacy to belong within marriage. Living together before marriage commonly fosters sexual sin and conflicts with biblical teaching, but God’s grace is available and there are practical, loving steps you can take now to align your life with His will. If you want to talk more or make a concrete plan, let’s meet and pray together.",

It correctly frames cohabitation as more than a neutral choice, highlighting covenantal implications, temptation, and witness concerns. It emphasizes grace, repentance, and practical steps (accountability, premarital counseling, boundaries), and it cautions against rushing into marriage merely to legitimize living together. Nuances are well-handled: grace in Christ, turning from patterns, and concrete actions to move toward obedience. A minor caveat is the use of the term “sacramental” to describe sex within marriage; some traditions reserve “sacramental” for specific sacraments, though many evangelicals use it in a covenantal sense.

        "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
        "output": "I am so sorry. I cannot imagine the weight of this loss for you. Your question is one of the most honest and important a grieving heart can ask, and it deserves a careful, compassionate answer.\n\nTwo brief truths to begin with\n- God is loving and does not take pleasure in death or suffering. The Bible shows a God who grieves with us (Jesus wept, John 11:35) and who says he does not desire the death of the wicked but wants repentance (Ezekiel 18:23). God is described as “near to the brokenhearted” (Psalm 34:18).\n- At the same time Scripture teaches that we live in a fallen world where sin, chaos, and death have real consequences (Genesis 3; Romans 5). Not everything that happens is a direct, delighted decree of God as if he were the author of evil.\n\nWhat people usually mean by “God willed it”\nWhen people say “it was God’s will” they can mean very different things, and that confusion often hurts more than it helps.\n\n- Sometimes they mean God permitted it (permissive will). God, in his sovereignty, allows events to occur in a fallen creation—sometimes as the result of human choices, accident, or the brokenness of the world. Permission is not the same as delight or moral endorsement.\n- Sometimes they mean God intended a specific outcome for redemptive purposes (decretive will). Scripture teaches God can and does bring good out of evil (e.g., Joseph: “What you meant for evil, God meant for good” — Genesis 50:20). But that does not erase the evil, pain, or responsibility involved.\n- Sometimes they are trying to comfort but end up sounding like they’re explaining away your pain. Saying “everything happens for a reason” can sound like you must accept or be grateful for the suffering—when in reality grief must be felt, not minimized.\n\nScripture models honest grief and hard questions\nThe Bible does not silence honest questioning and lament. David cries out, “How long?” (Psalm 13). Habakkuk argues with God. Job pours out anger and sorrow. Jesus himself cried out in agony at Lazarus’ death and on the cross (“My God, my God…,” Matthew 27:46). God does not condemn honest lament; he meets it. You are allowed to be angry, numb, confused, and to bring those feelings to him.\n\nWhere we find hope\n- God is with you in the grief: “The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18). 2 Corinthians 1:3–4 calls God “the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,” who comforts so we can comfort others.\n- Death is not the last word. Because Jesus rose, we have hope beyond death (1 Corinthians 15; John 11:25–26). Paul comforts: we do not grieve as those without hope (1 Thessalonians 4:13–18). Revelation promises a day when God “will wipe away every tear” and there will be no more death (Revelation 21:4).\n- God can bring purpose out of pain without making the pain good. Romans 8:28 affirms that God works for good for those who love him, but it does not say God caused the evil. The certainty is not that you will understand now why this happened, but that God can redeem and use even the worst things in his wider story of restoration.\n\nPractical, pastoral help\n- Give yourself permission to grieve. Don’t let anyone rush you with platitudes. The journey will have waves—shock, anger, numbness, anxiousness, sadness—and that is normal.\n- Talk about the child. Tell stories, look at photos, allow rituals (funeral, memorial, planting a tree) that name the loss. Silence can make grief heavier.\n- Bring your questions to God and to others. Pray honestly; join others who will listen (friends, family, a pastor, a Christian counselor). These questions do not make you less faithful.\n- Get help if you need it. Grief counseling, support groups (GriefShare, church bereavement ministries), and medical help (if you’re struggling with depression or safety) are all appropriate and wise.\n- Stay in Scripture and prayer, but beware of tidy answers. Read Psalms of lament (e.g., Psalm 13, 22, 88), John 11, 1 Thessalonians 4, and passages of comfort (Psalm 23; 2 Corinthians 1:3–4). Let Scripture shape your grief rather than let others’ clichés define it.\n\nA few honest theological lines to hold together\n- God’s love and goodness are not contradictory to your pain. He mourns with you even while he works, ultimately, for redemption.\n- God permits broken things in a world marred by sin; permitting is not the same as approving.\n- God can bring ultimate good (redeeming purposes, comfort, spiritual growth, witness) out of suffering, but that does not mean the suffering was good or that you must be grateful for the loss.\n\nCan I pray with you now?\nGracious Father, we bring this parent's broken heart to you. We do not understand this loss; we only know the ache. Comfort this soul with your nearness; give them your peace that passes understanding. Hold the memory of their child in your hands, and grant the hope of the resurrection into which Jesus has gone before us. Give wisdom and care to those who walk alongside them today. In Jesus’ name, amen.\n\nIf you would like, I’d be honored to meet with you, pray with you, or help connect you to a Christian grief counselor or support group. You don’t have to carry this alone.",

The answer normalizes lament and honest questioning (citing Psalms, Job, Habakkuk) and anchors hope in Scripture (Psalm 34:18; 2 Corinthians 1:3–4; 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18; Revelation 21:4; John 11:25–26). Practical pastoral guidance (grief expression, community support, counseling) and a prayer are appropriate and helpful. The argument remains balanced: suffering is real and not morally good; God can redeem without implying He authored the evil. A minor improvement could be explicit acknowledgment that some aspects of God’s purposes in suffering remain mysterious, but the response already softens certainty about understanding the exact reasons. Overall, the answer aligns well with historic Christian orthodoxy and biblical teaching."

Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
        "output": "First, thank you for asking this. I’m so sorry you’ve carried depression for years, and for the hurt of being told by other Christians that your struggle equals weak faith. That message is neither biblical nor loving. Let me say plainly: you are not failing spiritually because you have depression or because you take medicine for it.\n\nWhat Scripture and faithful pastoral care teach\n\n- The Bible knows about deep sorrow, despair, and prolonged suffering. Look at the psalmists who pour out honest pain (Psalm 42; Psalm 88 is a cry that never lets up). David, Jeremiah, and Elijah experienced anguish and exhaustion (1 Kings 19:4). Jesus himself wept (John 11:35). God’s people are allowed to be broken and to bring that brokenness to God.\n- God is present with the hurting. “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18). “Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).\n- Suffering is not always a sign of personal sin or spiritual failure. Paul had a “thorn in the flesh” (2 Corinthians 12:7–10). He prayed for relief, and God’s answer was sustaining grace rather than removal. Paul remained a man of deep faith despite ongoing struggle.\n- Biblical wisdom allows for using means God provides. Scripture speaks of seeking wise counsel (Proverbs 11:14; 15:22) and of using remedies—Paul told Timothy to take wine for his stomach (1 Timothy 5:23). Medicine is part of God’s common grace, a tool to help our bodies and minds heal.\n\nSo: medication does not prove lack of trust in God. Taking medicine can be an act of stewardship—using the gifts God has given through doctors, science, and community.\n\nPractical pastoral and spiritual help\n\n1. Keep your medical care. If medications help you function and reduce suffering, that’s a good and wise use of treatment. Keep your prescriber informed about how you’re doing and about any spiritual or emotional concerns.\n2. Add counseling if you can. A Christian therapist who understands both psychology and theology can help you integrate faith and treatment. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, talk therapy, and other approaches often work well with medication.\n3. Cultivate spiritual rhythms that are accessible. Depression often makes big spiritual practices feel impossible. Small, steady things count: a short Scripture verse in the morning, the Lord’s Prayer, the Psalms of lament, brief prayers throughout the day, participation in worship or small group when you can. Philippians 4:6–7 and Matthew 11:28 are good starting points.\n4. Build a trusted support network. Tell one or two mature Christians (a pastor, a wise friend) about your situation so you’re not isolated. James 5:16 speaks of confessing and praying for one another. Let the church carry you as you are able to carry others.\n5. Care for your body. Regular sleep, daylight exposure, modest exercise, balanced nutrition, and routine can significantly affect mood. These are practical disciplines, not moral tests.\n6. Create a safety plan if you ever have thoughts of harming yourself. If you are in immediate danger or thinking of suicide, contact emergency services or a crisis line right away (in the U.S. dial 988). Tell someone you trust and your clinician. Don’t carry this alone.\n7. Name and address spiritual concerns gently. If there are specific issues (unconfessed sin, unresolved grief, relational brokenness), find safe ways to work through them with a pastor or counselor. But don’t assume every depressive episode is primarily spiritual.\n\nHow to respond to people who say “just have more faith” or “medication shows you don’t trust God”\n\n- You can gently correct them: “I appreciate your concern, but depression has biological and situational causes as well as spiritual ones. I am committed to following Christ and also wise medical care.”\n- Invite compassion rather than quick fixes. The Christian response should be to bear one another’s burdens (Galatians 6:2), not to shame.\n- If a particular person’s comments are harmful to your health, it’s okay to set boundaries with them about what you want to discuss.\n\nA pastoral encouragement\n\nYou are not disqualified from God’s love or from meaningful Christian service because you struggle. The gospel rests on Christ’s grace, not on our performance. Romans 8:38–39 assures us nothing can separate us from God’s love. Your struggle does not mean God is distant or that you are spiritually dead. It often means you are a beloved child of God being refined in ways we don’t always understand.\n\nWould you like me to pray for you now? If you want, tell me whether you’re in immediate danger, if you have a pastor or counselor already, and whether you’d like recommendations for Christian counselors or resources (books, support groups, local ministries). I’m with you in this.",

              "rationale": "The LLM's response aligns with orthodox evangelical teaching: depression is a real, multifactorial condition; medical treatment (including medication) can be a wise, God-honoring means of care; faith and medicine are not enemies but can work together. It cites appropriate Scripture to validate lament, God’s presence with the hurting, the insufficiency of equating suffering with sin, and the value of wise counsel and medical means (Psalm 34:18; Matthew 11:28; 2 Corinthians 12:7–10; Proverbs 11:14; 15:22; 1 Timothy 5:23; James 5:16; Galatians 6:2). It provides practical guidance (continuing medical care, counseling, spiritual disciplines suited to depression, community support, body care, safety planning) and addresses common misperceptions (“just have more faith”). It also offers pastoral reassurance and a compassionate stance toward those struggling. Small caveats: the diabetes analogy (medication = insulin) is a helpful but simplified parallel, and while the response references Tim 5:23 plausibly, some readers may interpret medical treatment differently; overall, these are minor clarifications rather than doctrinal errors. The response would benefit from explicitly naming Job or addressing all plausible Scriptural interpretations, but it already covers the core biblical commitments well."

              ],
              "rationale": "The response is strong across theology, pastoral care, and practical guidance. It accurately affirms that depression can involve biological realities and does not indicate a failure in faith, while validating the role of medicine as stewardship and common grace. It weaves biblical grounding (lament, God near the brokenhearted, Jesus’ compassion, Paul’s thorn, wise counsel, and practical care) into concrete steps: maintain medical care, consider Christian counseling, adopt accessible spiritual disciplines, build a supportive community, attend to physical health, and have a safety plan. It addresses problematic pressures to “have more faith” with gentle correction and emphasizes bearing one another’s burdens. The overall tone is compassionate and hopeful, balancing truth with grace. Minor areas for improvement include more explicit crisis-resource guidance adaptable to international contexts and a slightly more nuanced discussion of the varied spiritual experiences that can accompany depression."
