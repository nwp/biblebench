    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "Here is a comparative theological analysis of the stated belief in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as understood within Latter-day Saint (LDS) scripture (Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price) alongside the Bible, contrasted with historic (Orthodox) Christian teaching:\n\n**Core Difference:** The fundamental divergence lies in the **understanding of the Godhead's nature and unity**. While using similar terminology, historic Christianity affirms a **Trinity**: One God in three co-equal, co-eternal, consubstantial (sharing the *same divine substance/nature*) Persons. The LDS position, often termed the \"Godhead,\" describes three distinct beings united in purpose, but **separate in substance**, with the Father and Son possessing physical bodies, and the Holy Spirit being a personage of spirit.\n\n**Historic Christian Orthodoxy (Based on the Bible & Ecumenical Councils):**\n\n1.  **One God:** Strict monotheism: \"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one\" (Deut 6:4). There is only one divine being (Isa 44:6, 45:5).\n2.  **Three Distinct Persons:** The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are clearly distinguished within Scripture and tradition (e.g., Matt 28:19, 2 Cor 13:14, John 14-16, Matt 3:16-17, Acts 5:3-4).\n3.  **Co-Equality:** The Son is \"of the same substance\" (homoousios) as the Father (Nicene Creed), eternally divine (John 1:1, Col 1:19, Heb 1:8), not a created being. The Holy Spirit is fully God (Acts 5:3-4, 2 Cor 3:17-18).\n4.  **Consubstantiality:** The three Persons share the *exact same divine nature, essence, or substance*. There is no hierarchy of being or essence within the Godhead (Son eternally begotten, Spirit eternally proceeding).\n5.  **Implications:** Salvation is understood as participation in the divine life through union with Christ, who is God incarnate. Worship is directed to one God revealed as Father, Son, and Spirit.\n\n**LDS Position (Based on their Standard Works & Prophetic Teachings):**\n\n1.  **Three Separate Beings:** The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are three distinct, separate personages (D&C 130:22, Joseph Smith, *Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith*, p. 370-372).\n2.  **Material Bodies:** The Father and the Son possess perfected, tangible, physical bodies of flesh and bone (D&C 130:22-23). The Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit without a physical body (D&C 130:22).\n3.  **Hierarchy & Progression:**\n    *   The Father is the supreme being, the literal Father of spirits (pre-existent souls), including Jesus and all humans (D&C 93:21-23, *The Origin of Man*, 1909).\n    *   Jesus (Jehovah of the Old Testament) is the first and greatest creation of the Father, later becoming a separate being with a physical body through the Virgin Mary. He is a separate *species* of being from the Father (a \"Son of God\" in a unique sense, distinct from human spirits).\n    *   The Godhead members are united in *purpose* and *will*, but are separate in substance and essence (D&C 93:21-23, 132:19-20).\n4.  **Eternal Progression:** God the Father was once a mortal man on another world who progressed to become a God (King Follett Discourse, *Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith*, p. 346-354). Humans have the potential to become gods themselves through obedience to gospel principles (D&C 132:19-20, *The Origin of Man*).\n5.  **Salvation & Worship:** Salvation involves progression towards godhood. Worship is directed to the Father, in the name of the Son, through the Holy Ghost.\n\n**Key Areas of Departure from Orthodoxy:**\n\n1.  **Nature of the Godhead:** Orthodoxy = One God, three co-equal Persons sharing one divine essence. LDS = Three separate beings (two with physical bodies), united in purpose but distinct in substance and essence.\n2.  **Divinity of the Son:** Orthodoxy = Jesus is fully God, co-eternal and consubstantial with the Father. LDS = Jesus is a created, divine being, a separate species from the Father, the first and greatest of the Father's spirit children.\n3.  **Materialism:** Orthodoxy = God is pure spirit, not composed of matter (John 4:24). LDS = The Father and Son are resurrected beings with physical bodies of flesh and bone.\n4.  **Eternal Progression:** Orthodoxy = God is uncreated, eternal, immutable. LDS = God the Father was once a man who progressed to godhood; humans can follow this path.\n5.  **Consubstantiality:** Orthodoxy = The three Persons share the *exact same divine substance*. LDS = The Persons are distinct substances (two material, one spiritual).\n\n**Areas of Agreement:**\n\n1.  **Belief in Jesus Christ:** Both affirm Jesus as the Messiah, the Savior of humanity, who lived, taught, died, and was resurrected.\n2.  **Belief in the Holy Spirit:** Both affirm the Holy Spirit as a personal agent of God involved in revelation, conviction, regeneration, and sanctification.\n3.  **Belief in God the Father:** Both affirm a supreme Creator God and Father figure.\n4.  **Belief in Scripture:** Both hold scripture (Bible + LDS works) as authoritative revelation, though the LDS canon includes additional texts considered scripture alongside the Bible (viewed as potentially containing errors but generally reliable where correctly translated).\n\n**Why this Difference Matters:**\n\nThis divergence is not minor; it strikes at the core of Christian theism:\n\n*   **Monotheism:** The LDS view risks Tritheism (three gods) or Henotheism (worship of one god while acknowledging others) from an orthodox perspective, though LDS theology emphasizes their unity of purpose. Orthodoxy sees the Trinity as the only coherent way to affirm both strict monotheism and the distinct biblical revelation of Father, Son, and Spirit.\n*   **Incarnation:** The LDS view of Jesus as a separate created species challenges the orthodox understanding of the incarnation – God (the Son) taking on a human nature *without ceasing to be God*. The LDS view can imply a human Jesus inhabited by a divine being (like a prophet), potentially diluting the full divinity necessary for salvation.\n*   **Salvation:** The LDS concept of salvation as progression towards godhood differs fundamentally from the orthodox view of salvation as reconciliation with God through Christ's atoning work, leading to eternal life in communion with God, not becoming God.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the LDS position uses the names \"Father,\" \"Son,\" and \"Holy Spirit,\" its underlying theology of the Godhead – characterized by the distinct, separate substance of the persons (two with physical bodies), the subordination of the Son as a created being, the eternal progression of God, and the potential for humans to become gods – represents a **significant departure** from the historic, Orthodox Christian doctrine of the Trinity. This departure centers on the nature of God's unity, eternity, immutability, and the co-equality and consubstantiality of the divine Persons. Areas of agreement exist regarding the roles and importance of Father, Son, and Spirit, but the foundational understanding of *who* they are fundamentally differs. This difference is profound and touches upon the very definition of God and salvation within the Christian faith.",

            "Imprecise portrayal of the LDS view of Jesus: describing Him as a 'separate species' or as created by the Father misstates classic LDS theology. Mainstream LDS teaching generally holds Jesus as the Eternal Son, the Only Begotten in the flesh, not a created being in the sense implied by 'separate species.' A more accurate formulation is that Jesus is a distinct divine person in the Godhead, eternally begotten, not created.",
            "Some nuance about the Biblical canon could be sharper: LDS believers affirm the Bible (typically the King James Version) alongside the additional Standard Works (Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price) as sacred scripture; the phrasing about 'potentially containing errors' is a standard LDS caveat (translated correctly vs. translation issues) but could be clarified to reflect the church's stated stance rather than implying broad doctrinal unreliability.",
            "The brief characterization of historic Orthodoxy as strictly '66 books' or 'without any continuing revelation' glosses over legitimate variations in Catholic and Orthodox canons and the role of Tradition. Orthodox and Catholic traditions differ on canons and on the weight of tradition, and while neither claims a new canonical Revelation in the way LDS does, Catholic/Orthodox perspectives on ongoing theological interpretation and apostolic tradition are nuanced beyond a simple 'no new canon' statement."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer correctly identifies major Orthodox-LDS doctrinal divergences (the Trinity vs. Godhead as three beings, material bodies for the Father and Son, eternal progression, and exaltation to godhood). It also notes LDS canonical plus-scriptural framework and scriptural authority disputes. The main room for improvement lies in avoiding oversimplified or potentially misleading characterizations of LDS soteriology and Christology (e.g., Jesus as an eternal, uncreated Spirit-Son vs. a 'created' being) and in presenting canonical/historical nuances of Christian orthodoxy with a bit more precision (canon, Tradition, and the scope of continuing theological guidance). Overall, the analysis is solid, well-grounded in Scripture references, and captures key theological nuances without endorsing the LDS position."
