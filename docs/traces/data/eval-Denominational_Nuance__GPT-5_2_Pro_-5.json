    "input": "How do charismatic/Pentecostal Christians differ from cessationist Christians on spiritual gifts?",
    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",
    "output": "Charismatic/Pentecostal Christians and cessationist Christians largely agree on core orthodox beliefs (the Trinity, Christ’s deity and resurrection, salvation by grace, the Spirit’s indwelling of believers, the authority of Scripture). Their main disagreement is *not* whether the Holy Spirit is active today, but **whether the “miraculous/sign gifts” described in the New Testament are intended to be normal and ongoing throughout the church age**.\n\n## 1) Basic definitions\n\n### Charismatic / Pentecostal (often “continuationist”)\n- **Continuationism**: The New Testament gifts of the Spirit (e.g., prophecy, tongues, healing, miracles) **continue** today and may be present in healthy church life.\n- **Pentecostal** often refers to churches arising from early 20th-century Pentecostal revivals (Azusa Street, etc.).\n- **Charismatic** often refers to similar practices **within** non-Pentecostal traditions (Anglican, Lutheran, Catholic, Reformed, etc.), typically without adopting all classical Pentecostal distinctives.\n\n### Cessationist\n- **Cessationism**: Certain gifts—especially **tongues, prophecy (as revelatory speech), and miracle-working/healings as a regular ministry “gift”**—were given for the apostolic era and **ceased** (or became non-normative) after the apostles and the foundational period of the church.\n- Many cessationists distinguish between:\n  - **God can still do miracles** (they affirm this),\n  - but **miracle gifts/offices** are not expected as ongoing ministries in the church.\n\n## 2) Which gifts are in view?\nBoth sides typically agree that gifts like **teaching, leadership, mercy, generosity, service** continue. The debate focuses on the so-called **“sign gifts”** or “revelatory gifts,” especially:\n- **Prophecy**\n- **Tongues and interpretation**\n- **Healings and miracles**\n- Sometimes also **words of knowledge/wisdom** (depending on how defined)\n\n## 3) Different expectations for church life\n\n### Charismatic/Pentecostal expectation\n- The gifts in 1 Corinthians 12–14 are often treated as **instructions for ordinary church life**, not merely a temporary phase.\n- Worship may include:\n  - prayed or sung **tongues** (public tongues usually paired with interpretation),\n  - **prophetic words** understood as Spirit-prompted encouragement/exhortation (often with careful qualifiers),\n  - **prayer for healing** with expectation that God may heal,\n  - a strong emphasis on **discernment** and “testing” (1 Thess 5:19–21; 1 Cor 14:29).\n\n**Pentecostal distinctives (classical Pentecostalism)**\n- Many classical Pentecostals teach a **distinct “baptism in the Holy Spirit”** as an experience often subsequent to conversion and empowering for witness.\n- Some hold “**initial evidence**” that tongues are the normal first sign of this baptism (not all continuationists hold this).\n\n### Cessationist expectation\n- Corporate worship and ministry should be structured around:\n  - **preaching/teaching Scripture**, prayer, sacraments/ordinances, and discipleship,\n  - reliance on **the completed canon** as God’s sufficient, final revelatory authority.\n- Many are cautious that modern claims to prophecy or tongues can:\n  - confuse believers about **revelation vs. illumination** (Spirit helping us understand Scripture),\n  - risk undermining Scripture’s functional authority,\n  - open the door to abuse or spiritual manipulation.\n\n## 4) Biblical and theological arguments (in fair summary)\n\n### Continuationist/Charismatic arguments (common themes)\n- **No explicit “end date”**: The New Testament nowhere plainly states, “these gifts will stop after the apostles.”\n- **Acts as a pattern**: The Spirit’s empowering and gifts in Acts are often seen as **paradigmatic** for the whole church age (Acts 2; 10; 19).\n- **1 Corinthians 13:8–12**: “When the perfect comes” is often interpreted as referring to **Christ’s return**, so gifts continue until then.\n- **Joel 2 / Acts 2**: “Your sons and daughters shall prophesy” is read as describing the **last days** era (from Pentecost until Christ returns).\n- **Ephesians 4:11–13**: Gifts are given “until we all attain…maturity,” again suggesting continuation.\n\nContinuationists typically emphasize that modern prophecy is **not new Scripture** and must be tested and subordinated to the Bible.\n\n### Cessationist arguments (common themes)\n- **Foundational role of apostles/prophets**: Ephesians 2:20 speaks of the church “built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.” Some interpret this as implying **foundational gifts** are not ongoing in the same way.\n- **Signs authenticating apostles**: Passages like 2 Corinthians 12:12 (“signs of a true apostle”) and Hebrews 2:3–4 (God bearing witness through signs as the message was first delivered) are read as tying miracle signs to the **apostolic witness**.\n- **Completion/maturation**: Some interpret 1 Corinthians 13’s “perfect” as the church’s maturation or the completion of the foundational revelatory period (views differ).\n- **Concern for authority and sufficiency**: If prophecy is treated as direct revelation, cessationists worry it practically competes with Scripture, even if people verbally affirm biblical authority.\n\nMany cessationists also appeal to historical observation: the gifts appear (in their reading) less prominent after the apostolic era, suggesting they were not intended as universal norms.\n\n## 5) What each side typically affirms (important clarifications)\n\n### What most continuationists affirm\n- Scripture is **final and normative**; genuine spiritual gifts do not add to the Bible.\n- Gifts must be practiced with **order and discernment** (1 Cor 14).\n- Not every claimed miracle or prophecy is genuine; abuses are real and must be corrected.\n\n### What most cessationists affirm\n- The Holy Spirit is **active**, empowers believers, sanctifies, guides, and answers prayer.\n- God **can** and sometimes does heal or act miraculously today.\n- The issue is whether there are **regular, recognized gift-ministries** of prophecy/tongues/healings comparable to the New Testament pattern.\n\n## 6) A spectrum within each camp\nThese labels can hide diversity:\n\n- **Continuationist spectrum**: from highly structured, “tested and weighed” prophetic practice to more spontaneous approaches; from “tongues as initial evidence” Pentecostalism to “open but cautious” continuationism.\n- **Cessationist spectrum**: from “hard cessationism” (gifts entirely ceased) to “soft cessationism” (gifts are not normative; miracles may occur but not as regular gift-ministry).\n\n## 7) Practical differences you’ll notice in churches\n- **Worship services**: continuationist churches may include tongues/prophetic impressions; cessationist churches typically will not.\n- **Decision-making and guidance**: continuationists may more readily reference Spirit-prompted impressions (while ideally testing them); cessationists tend to emphasize wisdom from Scripture, prayer, and counsel without treating impressions as “words from God.”\n- **Prayer for the sick**: both pray for healing, but continuationists may practice it with stronger expectation of charismatic gifting and may use healing-focused ministry teams.\n\n## 8) Common ground and orthodox boundaries\nAcross the divide, orthodox Christians generally agree:\n- Any claimed gift must be consistent with **biblical teaching** and the **gospel**.\n- Spiritual experiences must be evaluated by **Scripture**, Christian wisdom, and the fruit they produce (Gal 5:22–23).\n- No modern prophecy, vision, or tongue interpretation carries **canonical authority** comparable to Scripture.\n\nIn short: **charismatic/Pentecostal Christians expect and encourage the ongoing operation of New Testament “sign” gifts in the church today, while cessationists believe those gifts were uniquely tied to the apostolic foundation and are not intended as regular features of church life now—though God remains free to act miraculously.**",

          "rationale": "The response accurately presents the central doctrinal divide between continuationist/charismatic-Pentecostal views and cessationist views: ongoing sign gifts versus gifts limited to the apostolic era. It correctly notes common continuations (Acts pattern, 1 Cor 12–14, 1 Cor 13’s “perfect,” Joel/Acts prophecy etc.) and common cessationist arguments (apostolic foundation, signs authenticating apostles, sufficiency and authority of Scripture). It also acknowledges spectrum within both camps and practical church-life differences, while affirming orthodox agreement on the Holy Spirit’s activity and the authority of Scripture. Minor nuanced discussions (e.g., varying interpretations of Ephesians 4:11–13 or the precise boundaries of “revelatory” prophecy vs. edification) are represented, but not treated as definitive across all scholars, which is appropriate given ongoing debate. No clear doctrinal or biblical error stands out in a way that would mislead a reader about the core positions. The answer is well-structured and captures important distinctions without overstating either side.)"

It references non-Pentecostal contexts (Anglican, Lutheran, Catholic, Reformed) and identifies common criticisms on both sides. This indicates an aim at balance rather than advocacy for a single tradition. Potential minor limitations include: the Orthodox perspective is not explicitly addressed, and some nuances within Eastern Christian traditions are omitted; and while it notes gifts are not equated with canonical authority, the opening emphasis on ongoing sign gifts may be read as foregrounding continuationism. Overall, ecumenical balance is high."
