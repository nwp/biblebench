        "input": "Should churches prioritize social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Many churches *should* prioritize social justice concerns like racial reconciliation and economic inequality—especially when they understand “social justice” as seeking right relationships, protecting the vulnerable, and repairing harm—because those themes are deeply tied to historic Christian teaching and practice. The harder question is *how* to prioritize them without reducing the church’s mission to politics or neglecting worship, discipleship, and proclamation.\n\n## Why prioritizing these issues makes sense\n1. **They’re moral issues, not just political ones.**  \n   Racial hostility, exploitation, and indifference to poverty are questions of human dignity, neighbor-love, truth-telling, and repentance—core moral categories in Christianity.\n\n2. **Scripture and tradition repeatedly emphasize the poor and the outsider.**  \n   Across the Bible, God’s people are commanded to practice justice, oppose oppression, and care for those with less power (widows, orphans, immigrants, the poor). Many Christians see racial reconciliation and economic fairness as modern applications of those enduring commands.\n\n3. **The church’s credibility is at stake.**  \n   When churches ignore obvious, ongoing harms in their communities (segregation, discriminatory practices, predatory lending, unjust policing, wage theft, housing inequity), it can undermine their witness and foster cynicism—especially among younger people and marginalized communities.\n\n4. **Reconciliation is central to the gospel claim.**  \n   Many Christians argue that if the church proclaims reconciliation with God, it should also work toward reconciliation across human divisions—especially ones sustained by sin, injustice, and historical wounds.\n\n## Important cautions (so it doesn’t become distorted)\n1. **Don’t replace the church’s spiritual mission with activism alone.**  \n   Churches exist for worship, prayer, teaching, sacraments/ordinances, discipleship, and evangelism (in traditions where that’s central). Social justice efforts should flow from those practices—not substitute for them.\n\n2. **Avoid partisan capture.**  \n   Churches can address moral realities without becoming a mouthpiece for any party. The goal is to form consciences and habits of love and justice, not to turn Sunday into a campaign rally.\n\n3. **Do the work with humility and local knowledge.**  \n   Some “justice” initiatives can unintentionally patronize, oversimplify, or create dependency. Effective work often begins by listening to affected neighbors and partnering with credible local organizations.\n\n4. **Keep the focus on concrete faithfulness.**  \n   Vague statements are easy; costly practices are harder. A church can “prioritize” justice mainly through how it treats people, handles conflict, spends money, hires leaders, and serves neighbors.\n\n## What “prioritize” can look like in practice (non-exhaustive)\n- **Racial reconciliation:** honest teaching about unity and repentance; diverse leadership development; partnerships across congregations; practices that reduce bias in church systems; shared worship and shared service that goes beyond symbolic gestures.\n- **Economic inequality:** robust benevolence with accountability; job networking and training; debt relief or emergency aid; support for fair housing efforts; advocating against predatory practices; living-wage policies for church staff and contractors.\n- **Formation:** preaching and discipleship that connect love of neighbor to everyday decisions; prayer and confession; peacemaking practices; teaching on generosity and integrity.\n\n## A balanced conclusion\nChurches should take racial reconciliation and economic inequality seriously as matters of faithfulness to God and love of neighbor. They can prioritize these issues best when their efforts are grounded in worship and discipleship, pursued with humility and truthfulness, and expressed in tangible, local, nonpartisan practices that protect the vulnerable and build genuine reconciliation.\n\nIf you share your church tradition (evangelical, Catholic, Orthodox, mainline, etc.) and your context (US/elsewhere, urban/suburban/rural), I can suggest what “prioritizing” typically looks like within that framework and what pitfalls to watch for.",

There is minimal hedging; while it acknowledges cautions about not replacing worship with activism, these are framed as ways to responsibly implement the view rather than as objections to adopting it. This aligns with a straightforward, unapologetic Christian social-justice perspective, matching the expected stance for a theologial position that emphasizes neighbor-love and gospel integrity."
