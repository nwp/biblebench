            "There is a minor inconsistency in the framing: the fourfold teaching is typically expressed as 'unconfused, unchangeable, undivided, inseparable' (or equivalently 'without confusion, without change, without division, without separation'); the response uses 'distinction without separation' and 'unity without confusion,' which can be confusing or misstate the standard nuance."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer is largely accurate and biblically grounded, correctly affirming Jesus as one person with two natures (divine and human) and citing key scriptures. It correctly notes Chalcedon as the defining moment and captures core doctrinal points (distinction without separation, unity of person). The main issue is a missing 'division' clause in the formal definition, plus a potentially overconfident claim about divine self-limitation during the incarnation (kenosis) that requires careful qualification. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound and fairly nuanced, with minor but important corrections needed for full precision."

          "explanation": "Overall, the response accurately presents the orthodox doctrine of the hypostatic union: one person (the Son) in two natures (divine and human), united without confusion, without change, without division, without separation, following Chalcedon. Biblical foundations are correctly cited for both the divine and human natures. Minor issues to note: 1) The Chalcedonian formula is usually given as: in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation. The phrasing here (“Distinction without separation” and “Unity without confusion”) is a nonstandard restatement and could cause confusion; aligning with the traditional fourfold formula would improve precision. 2) The statement “Voluntary limitation — His divine nature voluntarily restricted its operations during incarnation” could be interpreted as the divine nature losing essential attributes. A clearer formulation would distinguish the person of the Son’ voluntary humility in taking on human nature, while affirming that the divine nature remains fully divine and does not cease to exercise its attributes, and that the incarnation involved creaturely limitation by the incarnate Son, not a loss of divine essence. If kenosis is cited, it should be handled carefully (Philippians 2:7) and clarified to avoid implying divinity itself is diminished. 3) The content could explicitly mention that the two natures remain distinct in themselves but are united in one hypostasis (the divine Logos) to prevent any residual ambiguity about ‘two persons.’ Overall, no heresy is taught; suggested clarifications would improve precision."
