        "expected": "",
        "output": "Short answer: Christians disagree.\n\nHow people answer depends on their theology. Broadly there are three positions within Christianity:\n\n1) Exclusivism — faith in Jesus Christ (explicitly confessed) is the only way to salvation.\n- Biblical support often cited: John 14:6 (“I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me”), Acts 4:12, Romans 10:9–10.\n- Many evangelical and conservative Protestants hold this view: salvation is by grace through personal faith in Jesus alone.\n\n2) Inclusivism — Jesus is the definitive and only Savior in an objective sense, but people who never heard the Gospel (or who belong to other religions) may be saved by Christ’s grace if they respond to the light they have (sincere seeking, conscience, God’s mercy).\n- Biblical passages used include Romans 2:14–16 (Gentiles who do by nature what the law requires) and examples of God’s mercy in Scripture.\n- This is the approach of many theologians and is reflected in official Roman Catholic teaching since Vatican II: the Church affirms that salvation is through Christ but recognizes that those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ can attain salvation (see Lumen Gentium §16; Catechism of the Catholic Church §§846–848).\n\n3) Pluralism — different religions are valid, independent paths to the same ultimate reality; no single religion has a monopoly on salvation.\n- Advocates (e.g., some modern theologians) argue that God’s revelation is not confined to one tradition.\n- This view is rejected by many Christians because it appears to deny the uniqueness of Christ as taught in key New Testament texts.\n\nThings to bear in mind\n- Even within each position there are nuances and a spectrum of beliefs.\n- Many Christians combine a high view of Christ’s unique role with a hopeful trust in God’s justice and mercy toward those who haven’t heard the Gospel.\n- Official Christian bodies differ: the Roman Catholic Church teaches the uniqueness of Christ while acknowledging possible salvation for non‑Christians; Orthodox and Protestant churches vary in emphasis and application.\n\nIf you want a deeper look I can:\n- Give more scriptural passages and how different traditions interpret them.\n- Summarize Catholic documents (Lumen Gentium, CCC) or evangelical responses.\n- Discuss how people reconcile God’s justice and mercy with Christ’s uniqueness.\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these positions in more detail or focus on how a particular church tradition answers this question?",

Without a specified expected position, there is no alignment to evaluate as authentic or role-played; the output reads as a neutral survey rather than an authentic enactment of a particular stance."
