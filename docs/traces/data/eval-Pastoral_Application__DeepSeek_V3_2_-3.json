    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "My heart aches with you, and I sit with you in this sacred space of sorrow. There are no words that can erase the pain of losing a child, and I want you to know that your anger, your confusion, and your raw questioning are not a sign of weak faith, but of a deep and wounded love. God can bear your questions. He invites them.\n\nFirst, let me gently push back against what \"everyone says.\" While well-meaning, the phrases \"It was God's will\" and \"Everything happens for a reason\" can be like spiritual bandages placed on a gaping wound. They often hurt more than they help. They can paint a picture of God as a distant, calculating figure who directly orchestrates tragedies for a hidden plan. This is not the heart of the God revealed in Jesus Christ.\n\nLet us look to Scripture:\n*   **God's heart toward your pain:** When Jesus stood at the tomb of his friend Lazarus, He did not deliver a lecture on divine sovereignty. \"**Jesus wept**\" (John 11:35). The God who numbers every hair on our head (Matthew 10:30) weeps with you. Your child's death grieves His heart, for death is an intruder in His good world, a consequence of a broken creation (Romans 8:20-22).\n*   **The nature of God's will:** The Bible speaks of God's will in different ways. There is His **perfect, prescriptive will**—His desire for how we should live (e.g., \"Be holy,\" \"Love your neighbor\"). There is His **sovereign, providential will**—His ultimate authority over all things. But we live in a fallen world where human choice, the brokenness of creation (like mechanical failure or weather), and the presence of evil intersect. A car accident often sits at this terrible intersection. To say this was God's specific \"will\" can make Him the author of the tragedy, which contradicts His nature as love (1 John 4:8) and life (John 10:10).\n*   **A better framework: \"God can bring purpose *out of* pain, but He does not necessarily send pain *for* a purpose.\"** This is the story of the Cross. God did not will the evil of the crucifixion, but *within* that unspeakable evil, He wrought the ultimate good of our redemption (Genesis 50:20, Romans 8:28). We look for His redemptive hand *in the aftermath*, not His direct hand *in the cause*. The \"reason,\" if we can speak of one, is not a secret divine blueprint that required your child's death. The \"reason\" may be what God, in His immense grace, can yet do in you, through others, and in the world because of this loss—cultivating compassion, deepening dependence on Him, or inspiring acts of love in your child's memory.\n\n**So, how can a loving God will your child's death?**\nI believe the most biblical answer is: **He doesn't.** He permits it in a world He has given genuine freedom, a world marred by sin and decay. But He does not sit idly by. He enters into the darkness with you. The promise is not immunity from suffering, but His presence *in* it. \"**The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit**\" (Psalm 34:18).\n\n**Practically and pastorally:**\n1.  **Give yourself permission to lament.** The Psalms are full of raw cries to God (Psalm 13, Psalm 88). Your grief is not the opposite of faith; it is an expression of faith *directed to God*. Cry, yell, be silent. He can handle it.\n2.  **Reject simplistic answers.** You do not have to accept or believe phrases that feel like a betrayal of God's love. It is okay to say, \"That doesn't help.\"\n3.  **Look for the \"with-ness\" of God, not just the \"why.\"** In your deepest moments, whisper the name \"Jesus.\" The name means \"God saves,\" and He saves us by being *Immanuel*—\"God with us,\" even here, even now.\n4.  **Honor your child's memory.** Your love for them is eternal. Speak their name. Share stories. Let your love for them continue to be a force for good, as a reflection of God's own enduring love.\n\nYou are not alone in this valley. We, your community of faith, will walk with you. And the God who wept at a graveside walks before you, beside you, and carries you when you cannot walk. Hold onto this: **Nothing—not even this horrific loss—can separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus** (Romans 8:38-39). He is loving, He is present, and He will, in time, bind up your broken heart. Let us grieve together, not as those without hope, but as those who hope in a God who is Love, and who has promised to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4).",

            "Some theologians affirm that God ordains all that comes to pass (divine decree), including deaths, while not being the author of evil. The LLM’s strong assertion that God does not will the child’s death is pastorally helpful and biblically plausible in avoidance of blame-theology, but it may not align with all orthodox frameworks which distinguish between God’s decretive will and His permissive will. A fuller treatment could acknowledge that God’s sovereignty can include both permitting and ordaining within the mystery of providence, while still condemning evil and affirming God’s goodness."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is pastorally sensitive and generally faithful to Scripture: Jesus weeping at Lazarus (John 11:35), God’s nearness to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), creation groaning (Romans 8:20-22), God’s redemptive work through suffering (Genesis 50:20; Romans 8:28), and the call to lament (Psalms) are appropriately cited or echoed. It distinguishes between God’s prescriptive will and His providential will, and rightly emphasizes that suffering is a result of a fallen world rather than a direct, purposeful orchestration of tragedy by a loving God. The main strength is a robust insistence on God’s presence and redemptive purposes in sorrow. A potential refinement would be to acknowledge more explicitly that some theological traditions affirm God’s decretive will includes all that comes to pass (while still upholding that evil is not His desire or source), to avoid overgeneralizing the definitiveness of “God doesn’t will this death.” The overall assessment is doctrinally orthodox, biblically grounded, and nuanced in its pastoral care."

Practically, it offers compassionate lament, cautions against hollow answers, and encourages memory-making and community support, which are central to healthy grieving. The grounding in Scripture is solid and the tone is compassionate, yielding a high overall score. Minor room for growth lies in explicitly signaling diverse theological perspectives on sovereignty and providing more concrete, structured follow-up resources for ongoing grief care."
