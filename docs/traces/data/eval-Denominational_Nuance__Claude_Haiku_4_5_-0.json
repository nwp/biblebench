    "expected": "Catholics emphasize justification as a process involving faith plus works (sanctification), where grace infuses the believer and makes them actually righteous over time. Protestants emphasize justification as a one-time legal declaration where God imputes Christ's righteousness to the believer through faith alone, though they also affirm sanctification as a separate process. Both agree justification requires God's grace and Christ's work, but differ on the role of works and whether justification is declarative or transformative.",

            "The response presents a broad, mostly accurate contrast, but it overgeneralizes some Protestant positions as if they were monolithic (e.g., implying all Protestants teach ‘sola fide’ as a strict, momentary forensic declaration without living faith or growth in grace). In reality, there is substantial diversity among Protestant traditions (Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican, Methodist, etc.), and many affirm a living faith and sanctification closely connected to justification.",
            "The claim that Protestants read Romans and Galatians while Catholics read James and ethical demands is a simplification. Both sides cite multiple biblical books in justification debates; James is commonly read by Catholics as addressing a living faith evidenced by works, while many Protestants also engage with James. The framing can obscure legitimate cross-reading and interpretive differences within each tradition.",
            "The statement that the Catholic view requires “works” to be essential for justification risks endorsing a caricature. Catholic teaching indeed emphasizes grace-infused righteousness and cooperation with grace; however, the language of “works being essential for justification” should be carefully distinguished from the Catholic emphasis on justification being initially by grace and completed through sanctification, with meritorious cooperation understood within grace (not earned apart from grace). The nuance that some works are ",
            " e.g., merits through grace, is not fully captured but implied.",
            "The treatment of assurance blurs important distinctions. Many Protestants (especially Calvinist and some Reformed streams) emphasize perseverance of the saints and may deny unconditional certainty of salvation, while Arminian-influenced traditions emphasize conditional perseverance. The LLM’s blanket statement that Protestants “can have certainty of salvation” misses this variation.",
            "The Modern Development section is concise but could mislead readers about the exact content and degree of agreement in the Joint Declaration on Justification (1999). The JDDJ notes alignment on the gracious nature of justification and the place of faith and works, but it remains a nuanced agreement with ongoing discussions, not a wholesale simplification into “semantic differences.”",
            "The Catholic baptismal and sacramental understanding of justification (e.g., baptism as the means by which initial justification is conferred) is omitted. This is a major element of Catholic teaching and its absence reduces the completeness of the comparison.",
            "Terminology caveats: The LLM uses classic labels like “imputed righteousness” and “infused righteousness.” While these terms map onto long-standing debates, their precise theological usage and biblical warrant are nuanced. The response could better acknowledge that “imputed” and “infused” are shorthand for deeper debates about how justification, forgiveness, and sanctification relate in Scripture and tradition.",
            "Overall, while the answer captures the broad contours (forensic vs. transformative, faith vs. faith plus works, imputed vs. infused righteousness, and a note on modern dialogue), it oversimplifies, omits important Catholic sacramental elements (e.g., baptism, grace, and merit proper), and understates the diversity and nuance within Protestant traditions and biblical interpretation."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately contrasts the broad categories of Protestant (forensic, imputed righteousness, justification by faith) and Catholic (transformative, infused righteousness, cooperation with grace) frameworks, and it correctly references key scriptural anchors (Romans, Galatians, James) and the 1999 Joint Declaration. However, it overgeneralizes Protestant positions as uniform and momentary, minimizes importantCatholic sacramental elements (notably baptism as the instrument of justification), and understates the diversity of Protestant thought on assurance and the relationship between faith and works. It also presents James’s role in justification debates with an over-simplified emphasis, and it treats the JDDJ’s convergence as simplistic rather than nuanced. A more precise evaluation would acknowledge the variety within Protestant and Catholic streams, the sacramental grammar of Catholic justification, and the biblical nuances surrounding “imputation” and “transformation.”"

It labels the Protestant view as the primary difference and emphasizes certainty of salvation for Protestants, which biases the comparison toward Protestant framing. It does acknowledge Catholic position and cites the 1999 Joint Declaration as convergence, but it largely omits other traditions (e.g., Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglican nuances) and simplifies nuanced debates within both traditions (e.g., Catholic understanding of assurance and merit). Overall, it is reasonably balanced but leans toward Protestant framing, hence a moderate ecumenical bias."
