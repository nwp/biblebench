    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "Thank you for naming this honestly. I want you to hear this clearly: you are not failing spiritually because you struggle with depression or because you’re taking medication. Faith and medicine can and often do work together as part of the life God gives you. Being faithful does not mean flatlining your emotions or pretending everything is fine when it isn’t.\n\nHere are some biblically rooted, pastorally helpful thoughts and steps.\n\n1) What Scripture says about faith, suffering, and healing\n- God cares deeply for the brokenhearted. Psalm 34:18: “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.”\n- It’s okay to lament. The book of Psalms gives language for pouring out sorrow to God (e.g., Psalm 42, 43; Psalm 6; Psalm 77). Lament can be a form of faithful worship.\n- Faith includes trust in God while we don’t yet understand our situation. 2 Corinthians 12:9–10: “My grace is sufficient for you... for when I am weak, then I am strong.” God’s power often meets us in weakness.\n- We are body and soul; caring for the body is not “unspiritual.” Luke, a physician, travelled with Jesus; biblical teaching affirms caring for physical health as part of living out our worship of God.\n- We cast our anxieties on the Lord (1 Peter 5:7; Philippians 4:6–7). Faith includes bringing our fears to God and asking for his peace to govern our hearts.\n\n2) Theological truth about medicine and faith\n- Trust in God does not require rejecting reasonable means God provides. Using medication or therapy can be a faithful response to a real, physical aspect of our humanity.\n- God’s provision for healing often comes through ordinary means—doctors, counselors, communities, and practices that help us live as whole persons. Jesus heals; he also invites us into wise stewardship of the bodies he bought with his own blood.\n- Depression is not a moral failure or evidence of weak faith. It’s a real condition with biological, psychological, and social dimensions. You can be deeply faithful and still need help to feel and function well.\n\n3) Practical steps you can take (in consultation with trusted people)\n- Keep medical care ongoing. If you’re already on medication, maintain contact with the prescribing clinician. If you’re experiencing side effects or not feeling improved, discuss adjustments with your physician.\n- Add a counseling or therapy component if you’re not already receiving it. A trained Christian counselor can help address patterns, trauma, coping skills, and spiritual concerns alongside medical care.\n- Build a small, trustworthy care team: a pastor or church planting group, a counselor, a physician, and one or two close friends who will regularly check in.\n- Create a sustainable routine. Prioritize sleep, regular meals, gentle exercise, time in Scripture, prayer, and a Sabbath rhythm. Small, steady disciplines often bear fruit over time.\n- Practice honest, safe community. Share with someone you trust what you’re feeling, what you’re fearing, and what you’re experiencing in treatment. Shame silences; vulnerability invites grace and accountability.\n- Engage Scripture in a hopeful, lamenting way. Use Psalms that name pain while turning to God in trust. Memorize a few promises (e.g., Psalm 16:11 about fullness of joy in God’s presence; Romans 8:38–39 about God’s unbreakable love).\n- Develop a safety plan if you ever have thoughts of self-harm. This can include removing means, contacting a trusted person, and reaching out to a crisis line or emergency services. If you’re in immediate danger, seek urgent help.\n\n4) How to respond when others press you with “more faith” or “you should trust God more”\n- A gentle, firm response can be: “I am trusting God and I am also using the means he has given me to help my mind and body heal. Faith includes seeking medical care and talking with professionals who can walk with me through this.”\n- You can affirm their concern while setting a boundary: “I appreciate your care. I’m praying about this and taking wise steps—treatment, support, and time. Please walk with me in patience and prayer, not judgment.”\n- If you’re in a church culture that equates any medical help with a lack of faith, consider inviting a pastor or mature Christian friend to study Scripture with you on this topic and to open space for honest conversation about mental health.\n\n5) A short, hopeful perspective to hold\n- You are beloved by God. Your value is not measured by your mood or by how “spiritually confident” you appear.\n- Suffering can be a place where faith grows—often more honestly, humbly, and deeply—without denying the reality of pain.\n- God can meet you in small acts of faithfulness today—getting rest, seeking help, choosing to show up to worship when you can, and praying honestly with him about where you are.\n\nIf you’re comfortable, I’d love to walk with you in this. I can meet you for a time of listening, prayer, and practical planning: who to talk to in your care team this week, what small step to add in your routine, and how to respond to well-meaning but hurtful words when they come.\n\nSample prayer you might use (or adapt):\nLord, you know the depths of my heart and the weight of my days. I believe you see me and you love me. Help me to trust you, even when the road is long and the fog is thick. Give me wisdom to pursue the care you’ve provided—through medicine, therapy, community, and your Word. Grow in me a faith that is honest, patient, and hopeful. Lord, be near to me now, and carry me when I cannot stand. In Jesus’ name, Amen.\n\nIf you’d like, we can tailor a plan for your situation (your church context, your medical team, and your daily rhythm). And if you’re ever feeling overwhelmed or at risk of harming yourself, please seek immediate help from local emergency services or a crisis line.\n\nWould you like to share a bit more about what you’re experiencing these days—how your church community is supporting you, and what you’re currently doing in terms of treatment and daily routine? I’m here to listen and help you think through next steps.",

It consistently upholds that faith and medical care are not opposed and that God can work through medical means. The primary shortcoming is a factual slip about Luke's travels; this is a historical detail rather than doctrinal, and the core theological message remains sound. To improve, correct the Luke reference and maintain careful biblical-historical accuracy alongside the theology."
