    "input": "What does it mean that humans are made in the image of God (imago Dei)?",
    "expected": "Being made in the image of God means humans uniquely reflect God's nature and character among creation. This includes rational thinking, moral awareness, creativity, relational capacity, and spiritual nature. While sin has marred this image, it hasn't been completely destroyed. The imago Dei gives humans inherent dignity and worth, distinguishes them from animals, and establishes the basis for human morality and purpose.",
    "output": "In Scripture, the *imago Dei* (“image of God”) means that human beings are created by God to **represent him** and to **reflect him** in the world—uniquely among earthly creatures—so that our life, relationships, and rule over creation are meant to correspond to God’s character and purposes.\n\n## 1) The biblical foundation: Genesis 1:26–28\nThe doctrine comes chiefly from:\n\n- **Genesis 1:26–27**: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness… So God created man in his own image… male and female he created them.”\n- **Genesis 1:28** links image-bearing to a calling: “Be fruitful… fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion…”\n\nTwo observations are crucial:\n1. The image is given to **humanity as such** (not only to kings, males, or an elite class).  \n2. The image is connected to a **vocation**: humans are appointed to a kind of delegated stewardship (“dominion”) under God.\n\n## 2) What “image” means: representation and reflection\nIn the ancient world, an “image” could mean a statue or representative that made a ruler’s authority present in a region. Genesis uses that kind of royal language, but radically applies it to all people.\n\nSo, to be made in God’s image includes:\n- **Representation**: Humans are God’s appointed representatives in creation—called to “rule” in a way that reflects God’s wise, just, and life-giving reign (Gen 1:26–28; Ps 8:4–8).\n- **Reflection**: Humans are meant to mirror God’s moral and spiritual likeness—holiness, righteousness, love, truth—creaturely and dependently (Eph 4:24).\n\n“Image” and “likeness” (Gen 1:26) are not usually treated in Scripture as two separable parts (as though image is one thing and likeness another). They function together to emphasize that humans are genuinely like God in certain respects while remaining fully creatures.\n\n## 3) Key dimensions of the imago Dei (biblical emphases)\nChristian theology has often grouped the Bible’s teaching into three overlapping dimensions (they are complementary, not competing):\n\n### A. A **structural** (or “endowed”) dimension: capacities fitting for communion with God\nHumans are created with abilities that fit them for knowing and loving God and for meaningful moral action, such as:\n- rationality and wisdom (capacity for understanding),\n- moral conscience and responsibility,\n- spiritual capacity for worship and relationship with God.\n\nWhile Scripture doesn’t reduce the image to a single faculty, it repeatedly connects genuine knowledge, righteousness, and holiness to what humanity is meant to be (Eph 4:24; Col 3:10).\n\n### B. A **relational** dimension: persons-in-relationship\nThe image is not merely individual; it is expressed in relationship:\n- “male and female he created them” (Gen 1:27) highlights that human life is inherently social and interpersonal.\n- Humans are made to live in covenantal relationship—with God and with one another—reflecting (in creaturely ways) God’s own life of love and communion.\n\n### C. A **functional/vocational** dimension: royal stewardship over creation\nGenesis explicitly ties image-bearing to a task:\n- “let them have dominion” (Gen 1:26)\nThis dominion is not exploitation but **stewardship**: cultivating the earth, ordering culture, naming and tending creation (Gen 2:15, 19–20), doing justice, and protecting life.\n\n## 4) The image after the Fall: marred but not erased\nGenesis 3 portrays humanity’s rebellion and its devastating effects. Yet the image is **not removed**:\n\n- **Genesis 9:6** forbids murder because “God made man in his own image” (a post-Fall text).\n- **James 3:9** condemns cursing people because they are “made in the likeness of God.”\n\nSo, sin profoundly **distorts** our imaging of God (morally, relationally, vocationally), but every human still possesses God-given dignity and is accountable to God.\n\n## 5) Christ and the renewal of the image\nThe New Testament centers the imago Dei in Christ:\n\n- Jesus is “the **image of the invisible God**” (Col 1:15; cf. Heb 1:3).\n- Believers are being renewed “after the image of its creator” (Col 3:10) and are called to “put on the new self… in true righteousness and holiness” (Eph 4:24).\n- God’s goal is conformity to Christ (Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 3:18).\n\nThis means:\n- Christ is the **perfect** human image-bearer (what humanity was meant to be).\n- Salvation includes a real **restoration** of our imaging—ethically, relationally, and vocationally—by the Spirit.\n\n## 6) Major implications\nBecause all humans bear God’s image:\n- **Human life is sacred** (Gen 9:6).  \n- **Every person has inherent dignity** regardless of ability, age, ethnicity, social status, or productivity (Jas 3:9).  \n- **Justice and love of neighbor** are not optional; they are demanded by what people *are* as image-bearers.  \n- **Men and women share equal dignity and calling** as image-bearers (Gen 1:27–28), even amid distinct roles debated elsewhere.\n\n### Summary\nTo be made in the image of God means that humans are created to **belong to God**, to **know and love God**, to live in **righteous and loving relationships**, and to exercise **responsible dominion** over creation as God’s representatives—an image **marred by sin** yet **retained**, and **renewed in Christ**, the true and perfect image of God.",

            "The statement that 'image' and 'likeness' are not usually treated as two separable parts is an oversimplification. Some biblical scholars and theologians distinguish between imago Dei (image) and teleios/likeness (likeness), or at least discuss nuanced differences between the two terms. While many traditions treat them together, there is scholarly debate on whether they should be treated as distinct aspects."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns closely with orthodox teaching on the imago Dei: Genesis 1:26–28 grounds humanity as God’s representatives and his image-bearing under a vocation of dominion; Genesis 9:6 and James 3:9 affirm that the image persists despite the Fall; Colossians 1:15 and 3:10, along with Ephesians 4:24 and Romans 8:29, ground the Christ-centered renewal of that image; and the implications regarding dignity, dignity of life, and equality of men and women are standard. The answer also properly emphasizes the structural, relational, and functional dimensions, and notes that sin marred but did not erase the image. The only notable nuance missing is a fuller engagement with the sometimes debated distinction (image vs likeness) in scholarly literature, which is not essential to the core orthodox teaching presented."

          "explanation": "The response presents a broadly orthodox, mainstream Christian understanding of the imago Dei. It affirms universal image-bearing for all humans, describes its three overlapping dimensions (structural, relational, functional), explains the distortion caused by sin while maintaining that the image is not erased, and presents Christ as the perfect image and believers’ renewal in Him. No claims align with Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, or other listed heresies. A potential nuance worth noting (not a heresy) is the statement that image and likeness are not usually treated as two separable parts; some traditions distinguish them differently, but treating them together is a defensible and common interpretation. The emphasis on dominion as stewardship and on universal human dignity aligns with orthodox teaching and avoids salvation-by-work pitfalls. Overall, no significant heretical teaching is detected."
