    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "My dear friend,\n\nThank you for trusting me with this heavy burden. My heart breaks to hear that on top of the deep darkness of depression, you are carrying the added weight of false guilt. Let me say this clearly and immediately: **Taking medication for depression is not a sin, nor is it a sign of spiritual failure.**\n\nYou are caught in a crossfire of suffering and misunderstanding, and I want to walk through this with you using God’s Word to bring light, not more judgment.\n\nHere is how we can view your situation through the lens of Scripture and the Gospel.\n\n### 1. We are Embodied Souls living in a Broken World\nScripture teaches that we are \"fearfully and wonderfully made\" (Psalm 139:14), but we also live in a world shattered by the Fall (Genesis 3). Sin didn't just break our moral compass; it broke creation itself (Romans 8:20-22). This means our bodies are subject to decay, malfunction, and illness.\n\nThe brain is an organ, just like the heart, the pancreas, or the lungs. If a member of your church had diabetes and took insulin, would anyone accuse them of lacking faith? If they broke a leg and used a crutch, would we say they aren't trusting God to hold them up? Of course not.\n\nWhy, then, do we treat the brain differently? Depression often involves a chemical imbalance or a physiological malfunction. Treating a physical root of a mental struggle is an act of stewardship over the body God gave you. Medication does not replace God; it is typically a tool of *common grace*—a gift God has allowed human wisdom to develop to alleviate suffering.\n\n### 2. Biblical Heroes Struggled with Darkness\nThose who tell you that depression is evidence of a lack of faith have perhaps overlooked large portions of the Bible. The Scriptures are filled with godly men and women who struggled with profound despair.\n\n*   **Elijah**, one of the greatest prophets, sat under a broom tree and prayed that he might die, saying, \"I have had enough, Lord\" (1 Kings 19:4).\n*   **David**, a man after God's own heart, wrote, \"My soul is full of troubles... You have put me in the depths of the pit, in the regions dark and deep\" (Psalm 88:3, 6).\n*   **Paul** talked about being so utterly burdened beyond his strength that he \"despaired of life itself\" (2 Corinthians 1:8).\n\nGod did not strike Elijah down for his despair; He sent an angel to feed him and let him sleep. God did not reject David's prayers; He preserved them in the canon of Scripture as a liturgy for our own suffering.\n\nYour depression does not mean God has left you. In fact, Psalm 34:18 promises, *\"The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.\"*\n\n### 3. Faith is Clinging, Not Feeling\nThere is a dangerous misconception in some Christian circles that \"faith\" equals \"happy feelings\" or \"emotional victory.\" This is not biblical.\n\nTrue faith is often demonstrated most clearly in the dark. To wake up in the morning, feeling heavy, unable to see the light, and yet still say, \"Lord, I am Yours, help me\"—that is a heroic faith. Medication can sometimes be the very thing that lifts the \"fog\" enough to allow you to pray, to read the Word, and to engage in community again. In that sense, medication can be an aid to your spiritual life, not a hindrance.\n\nAs Charles Spurgeon, the great preacher who himself suffered from terrible depression, once said: *\"The mind can descend far lower than the body, for in it there are bottomless pits... [but] the Lord can save to the uttermost.\"*\n\n### 4. Practical Counsel\nSo, how do you move forward?\n\n*   **Continue your treatment without shame.** If your doctor has prescribed medication and it is helping, consider it a provision from the Lord. As Paul told Timothy to \"use a little wine for the sake of your stomach\" (1 Timothy 5:23), we are permitted to use physical substances for physical ailments.\n*   **Guard your ears.** You may need to set boundaries with well-meaning but misguided friends. You can gently say, *\"I believe God uses doctors and medicine as means of His grace, just as He uses food to handle hunger.\"*\n*   **Distinguish between the physical and the spiritual.** While medication treats the body, we must still shepherd the soul. Continue to feed on Scripture, even in small bites. I recommend reading the Psalms. They give you permission to be honest with God about your pain.\n*   **Rest in Christ’s finished work.** Your standing before God is not based on your serotonin levels; it is based on the blood of Jesus. When you are too weak to hold onto Him, He is holding onto you.\n\nYou are not failing, my friend. You are fighting a hard battle, and the Lord is with you in the trenches. Let us thank God for the medicine that grants you stability, and let us pray for the day when all tears will be wiped away.\n\nDoes this help settle your heart? Let's pray together.",

However, there is a factual error about Psalm 88’s authorship (David is not the traditional author), which affects the biblical grounding of that specific claim. There is also a potential issue with attributing a specific quote to Spurgeon without clear sourcing. If these two textual details are corrected, the overall assessment would be even stronger."
