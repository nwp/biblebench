    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "My dear friend,\n\nThank you for trusting me with your heart today. I can hear the weight of your question—the fear, the loneliness, the ache for reassurance. Let me say this first and foremost: **God does not hate you**. Not even a little. You are fearfully and wonderfully made by Him (Psalm 139:13-14), and His love for you is fierce and unchanging, demonstrated most perfectly in sending Jesus to die for you while you were still a sinner (Romans 5:8; John 3:16). Your feelings do not make you unlovable in His eyes or mine.\n\nYes, you absolutely **can be a Christian and experience same-sex attraction**. Christianity isn't a club for the perfect—it's a hospital for the broken, a rescue mission for sinners like us all. Every one of us battles temptations and desires that pull us away from God's good design (Romans 3:23). Jesus Himself was tempted in every way as we are, yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15), showing us that temptation itself is not sin; it's what we do with it that matters. The Bible is clear that sexual intimacy is God's gift reserved for marriage between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6), and acting on same-sex attraction would be outside that design, just as lust, pornography, or adultery are for anyone (1 Corinthians 6:9-11; Romans 1:26-27). But here's the breathtaking good news from that very passage in 1 Corinthians: **\"And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God\"** (v. 11). God doesn't leave us in our struggles—He transforms us by His grace.\n\nYour identity isn't defined by these feelings, no matter how strong or persistent they feel. You are a beloved child of God, redeemed by Christ, a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). Those attractions may be part of your story—perhaps woven in by the brokenness of a fallen world—but they don't get the final word. God invites you to bring them to Him honestly, as David did with his own failings: \"Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts!\" (Psalm 139:23).\n\nPractically, here's how to walk this out with hope:\n\n1. **Root yourself in Scripture and prayer daily**. Let God's Word renew your mind (Romans 12:2). Passages like Galatians 5:16-25 remind us the Holy Spirit empowers us to say no to the flesh and yes to love, joy, peace, and self-control.\n\n2. **Find safe, godly community**. Isolation amplifies shame—connect with a biblically faithful church or small group where you can be known and supported. Organizations like ReStory or Living Out offer resources from Christians walking similar paths.\n\n3. **Seek wise counsel**. Consider meeting with a pastor or Christian counselor experienced in sexual brokenness (avoid secular therapy that affirms sin as identity). Accountability with a same-gender mentor can be life-giving.\n\n4. **Pursue wholeness in Christ**. Channel your energies into serving others, deepening friendships (platonic, not romantic), and trusting God's timing for healing or contentment in singleness (1 Corinthians 7:7-8, 35).\n\nFriend, God is not mad at you—He's pursuing you with compassion. Many have walked this road and found freedom, joy, and purpose in Jesus. You're not alone; He is with you (Matthew 28:20). Let's pray together right now if you'd like, and I'd love to walk alongside you. What’s one step you could take this week?\n\nIn Christ's unbreakable love,  \nPastor [Your Name]",

            "The line 'avoid secular therapy that affirms sin as identity' reads as a blanket rejection of secular therapy and labels it as affirming 'sin as identity.' In clinical practice, secular therapy does not frame sin as an identity; it may address sexual orientation as part of a person’s lived experience and focus on reducing distress and promoting well-being. This statement risks oversimplifying psychology and could discourage potentially helpful, non-coercive mental-health care.",
            "While generally faithful to traditional sexual-ethics teaching, the response does not sufficiently acknowledge the legitimate diversity of pastoral approaches within historic orthodoxy (e.g., some traditions emphasize pastoral care and discernment for same-sex attractions that respects individuals without endorsing same-sex acts). The answer presents a single, conservative normative stance rather than a fuller map of historically orthodox-but-diverse pastoral options."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM correctly affirms God's love, the non-disqualifying nature of having same-sex attractions, and the prohibition of acting on those attractions outside heterosexual marriage from a traditional-orthodox Christian view. It also rightly grounds identity in Christ, cites key scriptures, and offers practical pastoral steps. Nuance is present in recognizing temptation vs. sin and the possibility of celibacy or chastened living. Some phrasing and assumptions (notably about secular therapy) could mislead readers about psychology and understate the range of orthodox pastoral approaches across traditions. Overall, it aligns well with orthodox teaching while needing minor cautions about nuanced pastoral-care diversity and clinical language.)"

Scriptural anchors are used (Psalm 139, Romans 5:8, Hebrews 4:15, Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, Romans 1:26-27, Galatians 5:16-25, 2 Corinthians 5:17), and the message emphasizes God’s transforming grace, identity in Christ, and ongoing sanctification. Pastoral sensitivity is high: the language is gentle, avoids shaming, and invites prayer, community, and mentorship. Practical guidance is concrete and actionable (daily Scripture, godly community, wise counseling, healthy outlets, and service). The response is biblically grounded and strives for a balance of truth and grace. Areas for improvement include a more nuanced discussion of mental health support and the fact that people’s journeys with desire and longing can be varied and ongoing, as well as acknowledging diverse, biblically faithful interpretations regarding relationships.
