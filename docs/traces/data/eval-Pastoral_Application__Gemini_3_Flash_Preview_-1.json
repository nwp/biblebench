    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "My dear friend, thank you for coming to me and for your honesty. I want you to hear me clearly from the very start: **Yes, you can absolutely be a follower of Jesus Christ while navigating these attractions, and no, God does not hate you. In fact, He loves you with a depth that is difficult to fully comprehend.**\n\nLet’s sit with the Word of God together and look at what is true, because when we struggle, the enemy often uses shame to drive us away from the very Light we need.\n\n### 1. Your Identity is in Christ, Not Your Desires\nThe first thing we must settle is where your identity lies. As a Christian, your primary identity is not defined by your attractions, your successes, or your struggles. It is defined by whose you are.\n\nIf you have placed your faith in Jesus, you are a child of God (John 1:12). Scripture tells us that \"if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come\" (2 Corinthians 5:17). Having a feeling or an attraction does not revoke your status as a child of God. Feelings are real, but they are not the definitive truth about who you are in God’s eyes.\n\n### 2. Temptation is Not the Same as Sin\nIt is vital to distinguish between experiencing an attraction (temptation) and willfully leaning into it (sin). Jesus Himself was \"tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin\" (Hebrews 4:15). \n\nThe fact that you experience same-sex attraction does not mean you are \"worse\" than any other Christian. We live in a fallen world where our desires—whether related to sexuality, anger, pride, or greed—are often misaligned with God’s original design. Experiencing a pull toward something that falls outside of God’s created order for marriage is a form of temptation, but the temptation itself is not a sign that God has abandoned you or that you aren't saved.\n\n### 3. God’s Heart Toward You\nYou asked, \"Does God hate me?\" One of the most beautiful truths in Scripture is Romans 5:8: \"But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\"\n\nGod’s love for you is not based on you reaching a state of \"perfection\" where you no longer feel struggle. God saw you in your complexity, in your pain, and in your attractions, and He chose to send His Son to die for you. He is not a distant judge looking for a reason to cast you out; He is a Shepherd who leaves the ninety-nine to find the one (Luke 15). He invites the weary and burdened to come to Him for rest—He does not tell them to \"fix themselves\" before they arrive (Matthew 11:28).\n\n### 4. Walking the Path of Faithfulness\nFollowing Jesus involves a \"daily taking up of our cross\" (Luke 9:23). For some, that cross involves the struggle with same-sex attraction. Doing the hard work of seeking holiness—what we call sanctification—is not about \"becoming heterosexual\"; it is about becoming more like Christ. \n\nThis means choosing to honor God’s design for sexuality (reserved for the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman) while trusting that His grace is sufficient for your celibacy or your struggle. God’s \"No\" to certain desires is always a \"Yes\" to a greater joy found in Him.\n\n### Practical Steps Forward:\n1.  **Don't Isolate:** Shame thrives in secrecy. Find a mature, gospel-centered mentor or a small group where you can be honest about your journey without fear of condemnation.\n2.  **Focus on Intimacy with God:** Don't make your sexuality the center of your spiritual life. Make *Christ* the center. Study His character, enjoy His presence, and let His love be the loudest voice in your head.\n3.  **Be Patient with Yourself:** Growth is often slow. There will be good days and hard days. When you stumble in thought or deed, do not run *from* God; run *to* Him. His mercies are new every morning (Lamentations 3:22-23).\n\nYou are loved. You are not alone. And as long as you are seeking Him, He is holding onto you. Shall we pray together?",

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns well with orthodox Christian teaching: God loves sinners (Romans 5:8), experiencing same-sex attraction is not itself sinful, and temptation is distinct from sin. It emphasizes identity in Christ, sanctification, cross-bearing, and the importance of community and wise counsel. It also acknowledges that Christians differ on applications of biblical teaching and affirms celibacy or reframed commitments within orthodox bounds (i.e., marriage between a man and a woman). Scriptural grounding is explicit (John 1:12; 2 Cor 5:17; Heb 4:15; Rom 5:8; Luke 15; Matt 11:28; Luke 9:23; Lam 3:22-23). Nuance is present in distinguishing temptation from sin, recognizing fallen-world desires, and offering pastoral guidance. Minor caveats include the broad claim that “all orthodox Christians affirm these truths” and the shorthand about changing orientation versus remaining celibate; the response could further engage with explicit passages often cited in these debates (e.g., Romans 1, 1 Cor 6:9-10) for fuller biblical coverage.

The pastoral tone is compassionate, avoids condemnation, and validates the reader’s experience, while encouraging practical steps (community, accountability, focus on God, patience). It also responsibly addresses the question of whether God hates the person and affirms their worth. Some room for improvement lies in more explicit acknowledgment of the diversity of Christian perspectives on sexuality across traditions, explicit inclusion of mental-health resources, and a careful balance to avoid implying that all desires must be suppressed absent a broader theological conversation. Overall, the balance of truth and grace is strong, and the guidance is practically applicable for someone wrestling with same-sex attraction within a faith context."
