            "Agency nuance: Deliverance is ultimately by God, acting through Moses. The phrase 'delivered by Moses through ten plagues' could be read as Moses being the primary agent. A clearer phrasing would be 'delivered by God, acting through Moses, by means of the ten plagues.'"

          "rationale": "The response accurately reflects the core elements of Exodus: oppression in Egypt under Pharaoh, deliverance by God (through Moses), the ten plagues culminating in Passover, the crossing of the Red Sea, and the giving of the Covenant/Law at Sinai. These elements are all biblically grounded and align with historic Christian orthodoxy. The main nuance to improve is the agency attribution; emphasizing that God is the primary deliverer with Moses as mediator would be more precise. The answer also captures essential components of the historical-theological context without major gaps."
