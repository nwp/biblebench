    "input": "Explain justification by faith. How does someone become righteous before God?",
    "expected": "Justification by faith is the doctrine that sinners are declared righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus Christ, not by their own works or merit. It is a legal declaration by God where the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, and their sins are forgiven. This justification is received through faith alone (sola fide), by grace alone (sola gratia), based on Christ's finished work alone (solus Christus).",
    "output": "## What “justification by faith” means\n\n**Justification** is God’s act of declaring sinners to be **righteous in his sight**—not because they have already become morally perfect, but because God counts them righteous **on the basis of Jesus Christ**, received **through faith**.\n\nPaul summarizes it like this:\n\n- “**We hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law**” (Romans 3:28).  \n- God is “**just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus**” (Romans 3:26).\n\nIn classic biblical terms, justification is primarily **forensic/legal**: a verdict and status change before God the Judge (cf. Romans 8:33–34), not first a description of inner moral transformation (though transformation certainly follows).\n\n## The basic problem: how can God accept sinners and still be just?\n\nScripture teaches that all have sinned and stand guilty before God:\n\n- “**All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God**” (Romans 3:23).  \n- “By works of the law **no human being will be justified** in his sight” (Romans 3:20).\n\nIf God simply “ignored” sin, he would deny his own justice. Justification is possible because God provides a righteous basis for acquittal and acceptance—**Jesus Christ’s saving work**.\n\n## The basis of justification: Christ’s obedience, death, and resurrection\n\nGod justifies the ungodly by grounding their right standing in Christ:\n\n- Christ’s death is a sacrificial, justice-satisfying act: God put him forward “as a **propitiation** by his blood… to show God’s righteousness” (Romans 3:25–26).  \n- Christ’s obedience counts for his people: “By the **one man’s obedience** the many will be made righteous” (Romans 5:19).  \n- Christ’s resurrection confirms and completes this saving work: “He was delivered up for our trespasses and **raised for our justification**” (Romans 4:25).\n\nIn short: **the righteousness that justifies is not produced by us; it is provided in Christ.**\n\n## The means/instrument: faith (not works)\n\n**Faith** is the means by which we receive Christ and his benefits. Faith is not a meritorious work that earns justification; it is the open hand that receives God’s gift:\n\n- “To the one who **does not work** but **believes** in him who justifies the ungodly, **his faith is counted as righteousness**” (Romans 4:5).  \n- “By grace you have been saved **through faith**… **not a result of works**” (Ephesians 2:8–9).  \n- Paul describes his desire to be found in Christ, “not having a righteousness of my own… but that which comes **through faith in Christ**” (Philippians 3:9).\n\nThis is why Protestant theology often says we are justified **by faith alone**—meaning *faith alone is the instrument*, while the faith that justifies is never alone in results (it produces obedience and love).\n\n## How does someone become righteous before God?\n\nBiblically, a person becomes righteous before God through these gospel realities:\n\n1. **God calls the sinner through the gospel** (Romans 10:17).  \n2. The sinner **repents** (turns from sin) and **believes** (trusts, relies on, receives Christ) (Mark 1:15; Acts 16:31).  \n3. By that faith, the believer is **united to Christ**, and God **credits/“counts” righteousness** to them (Romans 4:3–6; 2 Corinthians 5:21).  \n4. God therefore **forgives sins** and **declares** the believer righteous in his court (Romans 3:24; 8:1, 33–34).  \n5. From that new standing flows a new life: sanctification and good works as fruit (Ephesians 2:10; Titus 3:5–8).\n\nA key Old Testament example is Abraham:\n\n- “Abraham **believed** God, and it was **counted to him as righteousness**” (Genesis 15:6; quoted in Romans 4:3; Galatians 3:6).\n\n## What about works and James 2?\n\nScripture is clear that works cannot be the ground of our right standing:\n\n- “Not because of works done by us in righteousness” (Titus 3:5).\n\nYet Scripture is also clear that genuine faith produces a transformed life:\n\n- “Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead” (James 2:17).\n\nPaul and James address different errors:\n- **Paul** argues against earning acceptance with God by “works of the law.”  \n- **James** argues against a *mere claim* to faith that produces no obedience.\n\nSo works are not the **root** of justification but are the **fruit and evidence** of living faith.\n\n## Summary\n\n**Justification by faith** teaches that a sinner is made right with God **by God’s grace**, **because of Christ alone**, received **through faith**, **not by works**. God justifies the ungodly by forgiving their sins and crediting to them the righteousness of Christ, and this justified status then yields a life of growing holiness.\n\nIf you tell me your church tradition (Reformed, Lutheran, Catholic, Orthodox, etc.), I can also explain how that tradition articulates the relationship between justification, sanctification, and the sacraments while staying faithful to Scripture.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response provides a robust, biblically grounded, and historically orthodox explanation of justification by faith. Key features accurately represented: justification as a forensic declaration, not a moral transformation grounded in Christ’s righteousness imputed to believers; faith as the instrument, not a meritorious work; sola fide/sola gratia language through citations (Rom 3:28; Eph 2:8–9; Rom 4:5–6; Gal 3:6); the role of Christ’s obedience, death, and resurrection; the necessity of repentance and faith in gospel call; and the distinction between justification and sanctification with James and Paul in view. It also uses solid biblical citations (Rom 3, 4, 5; Eph 2; James 2; Gen 12–15 parallels) and an Abraham example to illustrate imputation. Nuance is well-handled: acknowledges forensic nature, yet notes that transformation follows; explains the difference between ground and fruit of faith; and briefly addresses potential tensions between Paul and James. Potential area for further nuance (not a error): some traditions affirm both imputed (legal) righteousness and imparted (moral) righteousness as part of justification/sanctification; the response emphasizes imputation while noting transformation as fruit. Including explicit mention of these other theological strands could broaden appeal, but is not a doctrinal error. Overall, the answer aligns closely with classic Protestant orthodoxy and scriptural grounding."

It also notes that genuine faith yields obedience and sanctification as fruit, and it harmonizes Paul’s and James’s teaching on works. Abraham is used as an exemplar of faith counted as righteousness. Potential caveats: some traditions (notably Catholic/Orthodox) understand justification with a more synergistic or transformative emphasis (infused righteousness) rather than strict imputation; this is a denominational nuance rather than an error. Overall, there are no heretical errors such as Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, or Docetism present in the text."
