It rightly notes historical condemnations by church fathers. Minor factual slips (Genesis 1:31 wording) and anachronistic labeling of 'sola scriptura' should be noted, but do not undermine the overall accuracy and doctrinal stance. The answer is well-grounded in biblical references (1 John 4:2-3, Romans 3:22, Genesis creation motif) and in historical orthodoxy."
