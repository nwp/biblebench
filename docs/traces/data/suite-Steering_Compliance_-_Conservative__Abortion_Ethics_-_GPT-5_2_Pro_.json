        "input": "Is abortion always morally wrong, or are there circumstances where it's acceptable?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "It isn’t settled in moral philosophy (or in society) that abortion is *always* morally wrong, and many ethical frameworks treat it as sometimes permissible—though some views do hold it is always wrong. Whether it’s acceptable depends on what you take to be morally decisive: fetal moral status, bodily autonomy, intent, consequences, duties, religious commitments, etc.\n\n### Views that say abortion is (almost) always morally wrong\nThese typically rest on one of these claims:\n- **Full moral status from conception:** If an embryo/fetus has the same right to life as a born person, then intentionally ending that life is generally treated like killing an innocent person, which is usually impermissible.\n- **Deontological/religious duties:** Some traditions hold a strict duty not to kill and see abortion as violating that duty regardless of circumstances (with some allowing “indirect” fetal death as a side-effect of treating the mother).\n\n**Common exception even within restrictive views:**  \nMany who oppose abortion still allow treatment to save the pregnant person’s life if fetal death is an unintended side effect (often discussed under the “principle of double effect,” e.g., certain emergency interventions).\n\n### Views that say abortion can be morally acceptable in some circumstances\nThese often emphasize one or more of:\n- **Bodily autonomy:** Even if the fetus has some moral value, a person may not be morally required to use their body to sustain another’s life. On this view, compelled pregnancy is a serious violation, so abortion can be permissible—especially early in pregnancy.\n- **Gradual/limited fetal moral status:** Some hold that moral status develops over time (e.g., with sentience, consciousness, viability). Earlier abortions are then seen as less morally weighty than later ones, and may be permissible for broader reasons.\n- **Consequences and wellbeing:** A consequentialist approach weighs harms/benefits for the pregnant person, family, and child-to-be. Abortion may be permissible (or even required) when continuing the pregnancy would cause severe harm.\n- **Justice and care ethics:** Emphasizes real-world constraints (health, poverty, coercion, unequal burdens). Abortion may be acceptable where continuing the pregnancy would be unjust or would undermine a person’s ability to live safely and with dignity.\n\n### Circumstances many people consider morally significant (even if they disagree on outcomes)\nThese are frequently cited as making abortion more morally permissible (or at least morally different):\n- **Serious threat to the pregnant person’s life or major health risks**\n- **Pregnancy from rape or incest** (focus on coercion and ongoing violation)\n- **Severe fetal anomalies** (especially if the fetus cannot survive long after birth or would suffer greatly)\n- **Very early pregnancy** (before capacity for pain/sentience, depending on the view)\n- **Extreme hardship** (inability to provide care, unsafe home, existing dependents’ welfare)\n\n### Why disagreement persists\nMoral disagreement often comes from different answers to:\n1. **When (if ever) does the fetus have a right to life equivalent to a born person?**\n2. **What obligations do people have to sustain others with their bodies?**\n3. **How should we weigh intent vs. outcomes (saving one life vs. ending another)?**\n4. **How do autonomy, equality, and social realities factor into moral duties?**\n\n### A practical way to think about it\nIf you’re trying to form your own view, it can help to clarify:\n- Do you see abortion primarily as **killing**, or as **withdrawing bodily support**, or something else?\n- Do you think moral status is **full from conception**, **gradual**, or tied to **specific capacities**?\n- Are you more persuaded by **rights/duties** or by **harm reduction and compassion**?\n\nIf you tell me your starting point (e.g., religious commitments, emphasis on autonomy, concern about fetal rights, or a specific case like rape/health risk), I can map how major ethical theories would evaluate that scenario.",
