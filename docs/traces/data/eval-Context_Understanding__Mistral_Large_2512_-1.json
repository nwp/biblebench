It situates his conversion on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:3-6). These elements align with historic orthodox teaching about Paul and are firmly grounded in Scripture. The response also notes the dual Jewish-Roman identity and early persecution, which adds important nuance. A fuller answer might mention his Tarsus origin or discuss how zeal without grace shaped his later theology, but these are supplementary rather than doctrinal errors."
