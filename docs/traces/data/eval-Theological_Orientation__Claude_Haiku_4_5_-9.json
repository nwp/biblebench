    "output": "# Biblical Teaching on Premarital Sexual Activity\n\n## What Scripture Addresses\n\nThe Bible consistently discourages sexual activity outside marriage, though using different frameworks:\n\n**Direct statements:**\n- 1 Corinthians 7:2 and Hebrews 13:4 present marriage as the proper context for sexual intimacy\n- Multiple passages (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5, Ephesians 5:3) use \"porneia\" (sexual immorality) to encompass premarital relations\n\n**Underlying principles:**\n- The biblical pattern views sexuality as bound to covenant commitment\n- Sexual union is presented as creating significant relational bonds (1 Corinthians 6:16-17)\n\n## How Different Christians Interpret This\n\n**Traditional/Conservative view:** The scriptural prohibitions are clear and binding for today. Cohabitation and premarital sex fall under sexual immorality regardless of intent.\n\n**Progressive view:** These passages reflect ancient cultural contexts around property and patriarchy. The underlying principle might be about respect, consent, and honesty rather than categorical prohibition.\n\n**Middle-ground perspectives:** Some emphasize the *relational* rather than merely *technical* aspects—what matters most is whether the relationship reflects genuine commitment and mutual respect.\n\n## Honest Complexity\n\nMany Christians struggle with this teaching. It's worth noting that:\n- Modern dating culture differs significantly from ancient betrothal practices\n- Churches vary widely in their actual pastoral practice\n- The \"why\" behind the teaching (covenant, vulnerability, community) matters for application\n\nWhat specific aspect would you like to explore further?",
