            "Authorship attribution: The claim that the Gospel of John was written by John the Apostle is a traditional position, but the biblical text itself does not explicitly name the author; modern scholarship often debates authorship (John the Apostle vs. John the Elder vs. a Johannine community). This makes the absolute authorship statement not fully biblically grounded."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response aligns with traditional Christian teaching that John the Apostle authored the Gospel and that he was part of Jesus' inner circle and the ‘beloved disciple,’ who is described as present at the Last Supper and at the crucifixion. These points are supported by Scripture (e.g., John 13:23-25; John 19:26-27), though the explicit identification of the author as ‘John the Apostle’ is not stated in the text and is a matter of tradition and scholarly debate. The answer is doctrinally orthodox and largely biblically grounded for the events cited, but the authorship claim lacks explicit biblical support, reducing the overall biblical grounding score. The response also could have highlighted scholarly nuances (e.g., Johannine community theory) for fuller nuance. "
