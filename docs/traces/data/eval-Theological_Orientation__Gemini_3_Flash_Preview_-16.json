    "expected": "",
    "output": "In Christian theology, the relationship between the \"Social Gospel\" and the \"Proclamation Gospel\" has been a point of tension for over a century. To answer this question, we must look at the biblical witness, the historical development of these doctrines, and the diverse perspectives within the modern church.\n\n### 1. Biblical Foundations of Justice\nThe Bible does not view \"justice\" as an abstract legal concept, but as a relational and communal obligation rooted in the character of God.\n\n*   **The Old Testament (Mishpat and Tzedakah):** The Hebrew prophets (Isaiah, Amos, Micah) consistently linked true worship with the treatment of the vulnerable—the widow, the orphan, the poor, and the sojourner. In **Isaiah 1:17**, God commands his people to \"seek justice, correct oppression.\" **Amos 5:24** famously calls for justice to \"roll down like waters.\" These texts suggest that economic and social arrangements are not neutral; they are subject to God’s judgment.\n*   **The Life of Jesus:** Jesus began his ministry by quoting Isaiah 61, declaring he came to \"proclaim good news to the poor\" and \"set at liberty those who are oppressed\" (**Luke 4:18**). His parables (like the Good Samaritan) and his critiques of the religious elite often focused on how systemic religious and social rules marginalize the weak.\n*   **The Apostolic Church:** The early church practiced a form of radical economic solidarity, ensuring \"there was not a needy person among them\" (**Acts 4:34**). The Epistle of James provides a scathing critique of classism and the withholding of wages from laborers (**James 5:1–6**).\n\n### 2. Systemic Racism and Economic Inequality\nWhile the Bible does not use modern sociological terms like \"systemic racism,\" theologians find clear parallels in biblical principles:\n\n*   **Imago Dei:** The foundational belief that all humans are created in the image of God (**Genesis 1:27**) stands in direct opposition to any system that devalues a person based on ethnicity or class.\n*   **Breaking Dividing Walls:** In **Ephesians 2**, Paul argues that the Gospel destroys the \"dividing wall of hostility\" between ethnic groups (Jews and Gentiles), creating \"one new humanity.\" For many theologians, this implies that the church must actively dismantle the \"walls\" created by historical and systemic sin.\n*   **Corporate Sin:** Scripture recognizes that sin is not only individual but corporate. The Israelites often confessed the sins of their ancestors (**Nehemiah 9:2**). This provides a theological framework for addressing \"systemic\" issues—where laws, traditions, or economic structures (like the Jubilee laws in Leviticus 25 intended to prevent permanent poverty) are used to address inherited inequalities.\n\n### 3. \"Gospel Issue\" vs. \"Distraction from Evangelism\"\nThis is the heart of the debate within the modern church. There are generally three perspectives:\n\n**A. Social Justice as the Gospel (Liberal/Liberation Perspective)**\nThis view argues that the Gospel *is* the liberation of the oppressed. Drawing heavily on Liberation Theology, proponents argue that to follow Jesus is to participate in the dismantling of unjust structures. In this view, evangelism without social action is hollow and unbiblical.\n\n**B. Social Justice as a Fruit of the Gospel (Reformational/Evangelical Perspective)**\nThis view distinguishes between the *message* of the Gospel (the death and resurrection of Christ for the forgiveness of sins) and the *implications* of the Gospel. Proponents argue that while justice is not the Gospel itself, a person who is truly saved will inevitably seek justice. They warn against \"Moralism\"—replacing the grace of God with a checklist of social activism—but insist that a silent church is a disobedient church.\n\n**C. Social Justice as a Distraction (Fundamentalist/Traditionalist Perspective)**\nThis view emphasizes \"the priority of the Great Commission.\" Critics here argue that the church’s sole mission is to save souls for eternity. They fear that focusing on \"social justice\" (often viewed as a secular, Marxist, or \"Woke\" ideology) replaces the eternal with the temporal. They argue that the only way to fix society is to change individual hearts through evangelism.\n\n### 4. A Balanced Theological Synthesis\nMost contemporary theologians seek a \"Holistic\" or \"Integral\" mission. This perspective argues that the tension between evangelism and social justice is a false dichotomy:\n\n1.  **The Kingdom of God:** Jesus preached the \"Gospel of the Kingdom.\" A kingdom involves a King (evangelism/lordship) and a local culture (justice/ethics). You cannot have one without the other.\n2.  **The Greatest Commandments:** Jesus summarized the law as loving God (vertical/evangelism) and loving neighbor (horizontal/justice). To ignore the neighbor’s systemic suffering is to fail in the command to love them.\n3.  **Credibility:** Theologians like Timothy Keller have argued that doing justice gives the world a \"reason to believe.\" When the church ignores economic inequality or racism, it creates a stumbling block that prevents people from hearing the message of Christ’s love.\n\n### Conclusion\nIs social justice a distraction? If defined as a secular political agenda that ignores the need for spiritual redemption, many theologians would say yes. However, if defined biblically—as the outworking of God’s righteousness in a fallen world—the Bible presents it as an essential expression of faith. In the words of the Lausanne Covenant (1974), \"Evangelism and socio-political involvement are both part of our Christian duty... A message of salvation implies also a message of judgment upon every form of alienation, oppression and discrimination.\"",

It leans traditional in its emphasis on the gospel, doctrinal fidelity, and use of evangelical language (Great Commission, Kingdom) but acknowledges complexity and legitimate diversity, signaling pastoral sensitivity rather than strict doctrinal rigidity. The explicit invocation of the Lausanne Covenant and the emphasis on scripture-based justice reflect a moderate-conservative approach that seeks to integrate doctrine with social ethics rather than subsume either under a radical revision of orthodoxy.",

It acknowledges legitimate disagreement by presenting multiple viewpoints, historical critiques, and biblical-theological arguments for each side, including references to theologians and the Lausanne Covenant. It then appeals to a synthesis that interweaves evangelism with justice issues, arguing that the tension is a false dichotomy and that genuine faith entails both proclamation and justice. The tone is measured and invitational rather than dogmatic, aiming to harmonize differing positions rather than advocate a single camp. This indicates recognition of diversity while endorsing a common, integrated approach to mission.)"
