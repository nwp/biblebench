    "expected": "Calvinism and Arminianism differ primarily on sovereignty and free will. Calvinists emphasize God's unconditional election, where God chooses who will be saved based solely on His will (TULIP: Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance of saints). Arminians emphasize that God's election is based on foreknowledge of who will freely choose faith, that Christ's atonement is unlimited, that grace can be resisted, and that believers can potentially lose salvation. Both affirm salvation by grace through faith and God's sovereignty, but differ on how divine sovereignty relates to human choice. Both views have been held by orthodox Christians throughout church history.",
    "output": "# Calvinist and Arminian Theology: A Fair Comparison\n\n## Historical Context\n\nBoth traditions emerged from the Protestant Reformation and affirm core Christian orthodoxy—the Trinity, Christ's deity and humanity, salvation by grace through faith, and Scripture's authority. Their differences concern *how* God accomplishes salvation, not *whether* He does.\n\n**Calvinism** is named after John Calvin (1509-1564), though it builds on Augustine and was systematized at the Synod of Dort (1618-1619).\n\n**Arminianism** follows Jacob Arminius (1560-1609), a Dutch Reformed theologian whose followers presented the Remonstrance challenging certain Reformed teachings.\n\n---\n\n## The Core Differences\n\n### 1. **Human Condition & Divine Initiative**\n\n**Calvinist View (Total Depravity/Inability):**\nHumanity is so corrupted by sin that people cannot respond to God without His first regenerating them. Grace must *precede* and *enable* faith.\n\n**Arminian View (Total Depravity with Prevenient Grace):**\nHumanity is equally fallen, but God extends \"prevenient grace\" to all people, restoring sufficient ability to respond to the gospel. Grace enables but does not guarantee faith.\n\n### 2. **The Nature of Election**\n\n**Calvinist View (Unconditional Election):**\nBefore creation, God chose specific individuals for salvation based solely on His sovereign will and good pleasure—not based on foreseen faith or merit.\n\n**Arminian View (Conditional Election):**\nGod's election is based on His foreknowledge of who would freely believe. God predestines *believers*, not arbitrarily selected individuals.\n\n### 3. **The Scope of Atonement**\n\n**Calvinist View (Definite/Particular Atonement):**\nChrist's death effectively secured salvation for the elect. His atonement accomplishes—not merely makes possible—redemption for those chosen.\n\n**Arminian View (Universal Atonement):**\nChrist died for all humanity, making salvation genuinely available to everyone. The atonement is sufficient for all but efficient only for those who believe.\n\n### 4. **The Nature of Grace**\n\n**Calvinist View (Efficacious/Irresistible Grace):**\nWhen God calls the elect to salvation, that call effectually brings about faith. God's grace accomplishes its intended purpose without overriding human will—rather, it frees the will to respond.\n\n**Arminian View (Resistible Grace):**\nGod's grace can be resisted. Though God genuinely desires all to be saved and works toward that end, humans retain the ability to reject His gracious offer.\n\n### 5. **Perseverance & Security**\n\n**Calvinist View (Perseverance of the Saints):**\nThose truly regenerated will persevere in faith until the end. God preserves His own; apparent apostasy reveals someone was never genuinely saved.\n\n**Arminian View (Conditional Preservation):**\n*Classical Arminians* hold that genuine believers can apostatize and lose salvation through persistent unbelief. *Many Arminians today* hold to eternal security, showing diversity within the tradition.\n\n---\n\n## Common Ground Often Overlooked\n\nBoth traditions affirm:\n- Salvation is **by grace alone** through faith\n- Human beings **cannot earn** salvation\n- **God initiates** the salvation process\n- Scripture as the final authority\n- The necessity of the Holy Spirit's work\n\n---\n\n## Denominational Distribution\n\n**Calvinist-leaning:** Reformed churches, most Presbyterians, many Baptists (particularly Southern Baptist conservatives), some Anglicans\n\n**Arminian-leaning:** Methodists, Wesleyans, Free Will Baptists, many Pentecostals, Church of the Nazarene, Assemblies of God\n\n**Mixed/Mediating positions:** Many evangelical churches contain both perspectives, and some traditions (like Lutheranism and Anglicanism) don't fit neatly into either category.\n\n---\n\n## A Gracious Observation\n\nThoughtful adherents of both positions wrestle seriously with Scripture and acknowledge tensions in their own systems. Calvinists must explain how God can genuinely desire all to be saved (1 Tim 2:4) while electing only some. Arminians must explain how salvation is \"not of him who wills\" (Rom 9:16) while maintaining decisive human choice.\n\nBoth traditions, at their best, are attempting to faithfully honor biblical texts that emphasize divine sovereignty *and* texts that emphasize human responsibility. The church has considered both positions within the bounds of orthodoxy, and Christians can hold either view with integrity while extending charity to those who differ.",

            "Irresistible Grace description: The LLM states that saving grace 'effectively brings about faith' and that it 'frees the will to respond' without overriding the human will. In classic Calvinist teaching, saving grace is described as irresistible for the elect and transformative (regenerating) the will so that faith is brought about. The phrase 'without overriding human will' can mislead readers into thinking grace merely enables an existing free will rather than regenerates or decisively transforms the will toward faith.",
            "Denominational mappings: Some statements about denominational leanings are simplified or somewhat inconsistent. For example, Southern Baptists are a large, diverse group with substantial variation in soteriological emphasis; it isn’t accurate to claim that 'most Baptists (particularly Southern Baptist conservatives)' are definitively Calvinist-leaning. Likewise, Anglicanism and Lutheranism contain substantial diversity and cannot be cleanly labeled as fitting neatly into one side of the Calvinist–Arminian spectrum; the response acknowledges range but also makes a sweeping characterization in places.",
            "Anglican/Lutheran nuance: The line about Lutheranism and Anglicanism not fitting neatly into either category is broadly reasonable, but the treatment could overstate the degree of non-alignment. Lutheran soteriology is monergistic and tied to specific confessional formulations (e.g., the Book of Concord) and often emphasizes universal atonement and salvation by grace through faith, which is not easily mapped onto the Calvinist–Arminian binary."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer provides a solid, mostly accurate overview of the classic Calvinist and Arminian positions, including key doctrinal areas (depravity, election, atonement, grace, perseverance) and common ground. It also acknowledges historical development and contemporary variations, which demonstrates nuance. However, two areas lower the precision slightly: (1) the Irresistible Grace description risks misrepresenting how Calvinists typically articulate the nature of grace as effectual for the elect (often described as transformative and regenerating, not merely enabling the will without any decisive alteration); and (2) some generalizations about denominational leanings (especially regarding the SBC and the ease of fitting Anglican/Lutheran bodies into the Calvinist–Arminian binary) are overly broad or inconsistent. Overall, the content is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded, with good nuance, but would benefit from tighter wording on grace’s mechanism and more careful categorization of historic traditions."

Minor caveats include occasional simplifications of nuanced positions (e.g., prevenient grace vs regeneration) and generalizations about denominational leanings (e.g., labeling groups as “Calvinist-leaning” or “Arminian-leaning”), which are common in broad overviews but can oversimplify the spectrum within traditions.
