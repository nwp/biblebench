    "input": "A church member asks: 'My teenage daughter just told me she's questioning her faith and doesn't know if she believes in God anymore. I'm devastated and scared. What should I do?'",
    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "Dear friend,\n\nI'm so sorry to hear this—your heart must ache deeply, and it's natural to feel devastated and scared when someone you love so dearly seems to be drifting from the faith you've nurtured in her. You're not alone in this; countless parents have walked this painful road, including some whose stories echo through Scripture itself. Let me walk with you through this with truth from God's Word, seasoned with grace.\n\nFirst, **take heart in God's unchanging faithfulness**. He is not caught off guard by your daughter's questions—Psalm 139:1-4 reminds us that He knows her thoughts intimately, even those she's just beginning to form. And Proverbs 22:6 assures us, \"Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.\" You've invested in her life; those seeds are planted, and God is the faithful gardener. Remember the prodigal son in Luke 15:11-32? The father didn't chase or coerce but waited with open arms, trusting the Father's heart in heaven to draw her back. Your role now mirrors that: steadfast love amid uncertainty.\n\n**Practically, here's how to respond with wisdom and compassion**:\n\n1. **Pray fervently, and invite others to join you**. James 5:16 says the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective. Pour out your fears to God (Psalm 62:8), and ask Him to soften her heart. Share this burden discreetly with a few trusted prayer warriors in our church—let's form a prayer shield around your family.\n\n2. **Listen first, without defensiveness**. Create safe space for her doubts. Say something like, \"I love you no matter what, and I'm here to hear your heart.\" Questions aren't rebellion; they're often the doorway to deeper faith (as with Thomas in John 20:24-29). Avoid arguments—doubts thrive in isolation but wither in loving dialogue. Ask gentle questions: \"What led to this?\" or \"What do you miss most about faith?\"\n\n3. **Model Christ-like love and your own authentic faith**. Deuteronomy 6:6-7 calls us to teach God's commands diligently in everyday moments. Share your testimony humbly—not as a lecture, but stories of how God has carried *you* through doubts. Live out joy in Christ before her; hypocrisy pushes away, but genuine faith draws near (2 Timothy 1:5 speaks of faith passed from Lois to Eunice to Timothy through lived example).\n\n4. **Stay connected without smothering**. Keep family rhythms like meals and church involvement, but give her room to wrestle. If she's open, explore resources together: books like *The Jesus I Never Knew* by Philip Yancey or podcasts like \"Ask Pastor John\" on doubts. Our youth group or a mentor could be a neutral bridge—would you like me to connect her?\n\n5. **Guard your own heart**. This trial tests *your* faith too (1 Peter 1:6-7). Lean on Scripture, a spouse or friend, and perhaps schedule a time to meet with me weekly for support. God uses even this to refine you both.\n\nFriend, many teens wander but return with faith stronger than before—I've seen it in our congregation. God pursues the one lost sheep (Luke 15:4-7), and He loves your daughter more than you ever could. Hold fast; redemption stories are being written.\n\nLet's pray right now: *Heavenly Father, wrap this family in Your peace that surpasses understanding. Draw this young woman near by Your Spirit. Strengthen this parent's faith and fill them with hope. In Jesus' name, Amen.*\n\nI'm here anytime—call me. You're doing the hard, holy work of parenting in faith.\n\nIn Christ's love,  \nPastor [Your Name]",

          ],
          "rationale": "The response is pastorally robust and aligns well with orthodox Christian teaching. It acknowledges doubt as a natural part of faith development, emphasizes loving listening, safe space, humility, and modeling authentic faith, and grounds guidance in Scripture (e.g., James 5:16, Psalm 62:8, John 20:24-29, Luke 15:4-7, Deuteronomy 6:6-7, 2 Timothy 1:5). It rightly removes fear and coercion, promotes prayer, community support, and practical resources, and encourages care for the parent’s own faith. Minor nuance gaps include: (1) Proverbs 22:6 is applied as a near-guarantee rather than a probabilistic principle, which can mislead readers about outcomes; (2) explicit citation of 1 Peter 3:15 (to model readiness to give a reason for hope with gentleness and respect) is not present, though its spirit is echoed. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and captures key pastoral nuances."

Scriptural grounding is strong, and the guidance emphasizes listening, safe space, prayer, and loving modeling of faith, with practical steps to involve the church and mentors. The main improvements would be to include explicit mental-health risk assessment and crisis guidance, acknowledge the uncertainty and non-guaranteed nature of outcomes in faith development, and offer a broader set of teen-focused resources and counseling options. With those enhancements, it would be even more robust for real-world pastoral ministry. "
