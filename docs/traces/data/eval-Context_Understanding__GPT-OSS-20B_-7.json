          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns with biblical teaching: parables convey spiritual truths indirectly and are most clearly understood by receptive hearers while appearing to conceal from those who reject or are unreceptive (as echoed in Matt 13:10–17). It also correctly notes that parables are memorable through everyday storytelling. These points are consistent with historic Christian orthodoxy and Scripture. Nuance is present but could be deeper: the answer could mention Jesus’ explicit statements about comprehending the mysteries of the kingdom and the prophetic fulfillment in Isaiah (e.g., Matt 13:11–17; Isa 6:9–10) and acknowledge that Jesus sometimes provided explanations to His disciples. The phrase “open to interpretation” is not inaccurate but risks implying ambiguity of meaning beyond what the text sometimes intends, which could be clarified. Overall, the core doctrinal and biblical points are sound with modest room for fuller nuance."
