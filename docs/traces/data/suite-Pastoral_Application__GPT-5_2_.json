        "input": "A church member asks: 'My teenage daughter just told me she's questioning her faith and doesn't know if she believes in God anymore. I'm devastated and scared. What should I do?'",
        "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
        "output": "I’m so sorry. When a child says something like that it can feel like the ground shifts under your feet—grief, fear, even guilt can rush in all at once. Take a breath: your daughter’s honesty is not the end of the story. In many cases it’s the beginning of a more real, owned faith. And even when it isn’t, God is not helpless, and you are not alone.\n\n### 1) Start with prayer and steadiness, not panic\nYour fear is understandable, but panic often communicates, “You can’t bring your real questions here.” Ask the Lord for wisdom and tenderness (James 1:5). Remember: God loves your daughter more than you do, and He is able to pursue her even in the wilderness (Luke 15:4–7).\n\nA simple prayer might be: “Lord, keep my heart steady. Help me listen well. Reveal Yourself to my daughter. Give me words that fit, and love that stays.”\n\n### 2) Thank her for telling you—and listen more than you talk\nIf she risked telling you, that’s a sign of trust. You can say something like:\n- “Thank you for telling me. I’m glad you were honest.”\n- “I love you. Nothing you say will make me stop loving you.”\n- “Can you help me understand what you’re feeling and why?”\n\nBe “quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger” (James 1:19). Ask gentle questions:\n- “When did these doubts start?”\n- “Is there something that happened that made faith feel impossible?”\n- “Are your questions more about God’s existence, the Bible, suffering, hypocrisy in church, or something else?”\n- “Do you feel pressured to believe—at home, at church, with friends?”\n\nOften “I don’t believe” is sitting on top of deeper things: pain, disappointment, anxiety, shame, intellectual questions, social pressure, or conflict with a parent. Listening is not agreement; it’s love.\n\n### 3) Separate *doubt* from *rebellion*—and respond accordingly\nScripture recognizes that sincere believers can wrestle: the father who cried, “I believe; help my unbelief!” (Mark 9:24). The Psalms are full of questions and lament (e.g., Psalm 13). Jude even says, “Have mercy on those who doubt” (Jude 22).\n\nIf she’s questioning honestly, treat it like a spiritual and relational conversation, not a courtroom trial. If she’s moving toward patterns that are clearly destructive, you can still respond with calm clarity—truthful, but not harsh.\n\n### 4) Don’t make it about your reputation or your performance\nParents often feel: *What did I do wrong? What will people think?* Those thoughts can quietly turn the child into a project. Remember: salvation is God’s work (Ephesians 2:8–9). Faith cannot be forced; it must be owned. Your calling is faithfulness—love, truth, prayer, and steady presence (Deuteronomy 6:6–7).\n\nIf you need to repent for ways you’ve communicated that Christianity is mainly rules, image, or pressure, do that humbly. Repentance can be one of the most powerful testimonies a teen ever sees.\n\n### 5) Keep the relationship warm and the conversation open\nMake it clear that questions do not end the relationship. Aim for ongoing dialogue rather than one “big talk.” Tell her:\n- “I’m here. We can talk about this as much as you want.”\n- “It’s okay if you don’t have everything figured out right now.”\n\nYour consistent love reflects something of the Father’s heart (Romans 2:4). Many teens need to see that Christianity can handle hard questions without breaking.\n\n### 6) Invite her to explore—without coercion\nYou can offer practical next steps that honor her agency:\n- Read one Gospel together (Luke or John) and talk honestly about what she sees in Jesus.\n- Encourage her to write down her biggest questions; take them one at a time.\n- Offer good resources that respect both mind and heart (books, podcasts, or a trusted mentor).  \n- Ask if she’d be willing to meet with a mature Christian woman—someone calm, thoughtful, and safe—who won’t shame her.\n\nA key point: Christianity is not merely a set of arguments; it’s centered on a Person. If she can keep looking at Jesus, you’re in a hopeful place (John 1:14; John 20:31).\n\n### 7) Pay attention to her whole life, not just her beliefs\nSometimes faith deconstruction is connected to depression, anxiety, trauma, bullying, loneliness, or online influences. Ask about her mental health, friendships, sleep, and stress. If you see warning signs, involve appropriate help—your pastor, a wise mentor, and possibly a licensed counselor (not as a punishment, but as care).\n\n### 8) Model a faith that includes both conviction and humility\nLet her see you:\n- reading Scripture not as a weapon but as bread,\n- praying honestly,\n- confessing sin,\n- loving people well,\n- handling suffering without pretending.\n\nPeter says to be ready to give a reason for hope “with gentleness and respect” (1 Peter 3:15). Teens can smell fear and hypocrisy; they also recognize integrity.\n\n### 9) Keep boundaries, but don’t make church a battleground\nIf she still lives in your home, it’s reasonable to maintain certain family expectations (respect, participation in family life, wise limits around devices, etc.). With church attendance, parents differ; but whatever you decide, keep the goal clear: not “winning,” but shepherding her heart. If she attends, don’t pressure her to pretend. If she resists, don’t let it become daily warfare. Seek counsel for your specific situation.\n\n### 10) Entrust her to God with persistent hope\nSome of God’s most beautiful work happens in seasons of wandering. The Shepherd goes after the sheep. The Father runs to the prodigal. Keep praying, keep loving, keep speaking truth in season, and keep your home a place where grace is real (Luke 15).\n\nA simple, steady pattern:\n- **Daily:** pray briefly for her by name; ask God to reveal Jesus.\n- **Weekly:** one intentional conversation where you mostly listen.\n- **Monthly:** involve a trusted mentor/pastor if she’s open.\n\n### What you might say tonight\n“Sweetheart, thank you for telling me. I’m sure that wasn’t easy. I love you, and I’m not going anywhere. Can you tell me what’s been making faith hard for you? I may not have all the answers right now, but I want to understand, and I want us to walk through this together.”\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a little more: How old is your daughter? Has something happened recently—loss, conflict, a change in friends or school, a church hurt? And when she says she doesn’t know if she believes, is it more intellectual doubts, or more emotional/relational pain?",

It also encourages humility, modeling authentic faith, prayer, and seeking wise mentors or counselors, which are consistent with historic Christian practice for shepherding adolescents facing doubt. It wisely avoids coercion and pressure, acknowledges mental health considerations, and keeps the relationship with the teen central, which is consistent with a gospel-centered, relational approach. It also anchors guidance in sound scriptural principles and key biblical narratives (Psalms, Jude 22, John 1:14; John 20:31).\n\nPossible minor improvements could include: explicitly tying doubt to the gospel proclamation in concrete, age-appropriate ways (e.g., briefly clarifying who Jesus is and why faith in Him remains trustworthy when questions arise), and offering more structured checkpoints for ongoing gospel-centered conversations beyond the broader pattern (daily/weekly/monthly) presented. Overall, the response is strongly aligned with biblical orthodoxy and sound pastoral practice."

Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
        "output": "Yes—you can be a Christian and still experience same-sex attraction. Having a temptation or an unwanted desire is not the same thing as choosing sin, and it is not proof that God has rejected you. And no, God does not hate you. The very fact that you’re asking these questions—wanting to know God and honor Him—often reflects His grace drawing you, not His disgust pushing you away.\n\n## 1) Your feelings are real, but they are not your identity or your verdict\nScripture is honest that we live in a broken world and that our desires can be disordered in many directions—not only sexually (Romans 3:23; James 1:14–15). Christians experience all kinds of temptations after coming to faith. Temptation itself is not sin; it becomes sin when we entertain it, feed it, or act on it.\n\nEven Jesus was tempted, yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15). That doesn’t make temptation “good,” but it does mean you’re not disqualified from following God because you experience strong pull in a particular area.\n\n## 2) God’s posture toward you in Christ is not hatred, but mercy\nGod’s heart toward sinners is not to crush, but to save.  \n- “God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).  \n- “God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him” (John 3:17).  \n- “There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1).\n\nIf you belong to Christ, God is not standing over you in disgust. He is a Father committed to your good—patiently shaping you over time (Philippians 1:6).\n\n## 3) The Christian life includes real battles with desires\nMany believers carry ongoing “thorns”—areas of weakness, grief, or struggle that keep us dependent on grace (2 Corinthians 12:7–10). You may wish your experience were different, and it’s okay to bring that sorrow honestly to God. The Psalms are full of prayers from people who feel confused, weary, and torn—yet still clinging to the Lord (Psalm 42; Psalm 73).\n\nFollowing Jesus doesn’t mean you never feel the pull toward sin; it means you learn, by the Spirit’s help, not to let that pull rule you (Galatians 5:16–17).\n\n## 4) Scripture calls all Christians to sexual holiness\nGod’s design for sexual expression is covenant marriage between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6). Because of that, Scripture consistently calls believers away from sexual behavior outside that covenant (1 Thessalonians 4:3–5). That call is not aimed at you alone—it’s a call to every disciple, whether straight, gay, single, married, divorced, or widowed.\n\nThe question is not “Do I have a particular temptation?” but “Will I follow Jesus with my body and my desires?” That is a costly road for all of us in different ways (Luke 9:23), and yet it’s a road marked by real life and joy in God (Psalm 16:11).\n\n## 5) You are not beyond the reach of grace—and you’re not alone\nThe church should be a place where people can be honest about their struggles and find help, not shame. In the New Testament, some believers came out of many sexual pasts and patterns, and Paul says, “And such were some of you. But you were washed… sanctified… justified” (1 Corinthians 6:11). The emphasis is not “Look what you were,” but “Look what Christ has done.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean change is simple or quick, and it doesn’t mean your attractions will necessarily disappear on a timeline you can control. But it does mean there is real hope: God meets you with cleansing, forgiveness, strength, and a new family.\n\n## 6) Practical next steps (small, concrete, doable)\n1. **Bring it into the light with God daily.** Simple prayers like: “Lord, you see my desires. Help me to trust you and obey you today.” (Psalm 139:1–4; Hebrews 4:16)  \n2. **Find one mature Christian to talk with regularly.** A pastor, counselor, or trusted mentor who will be truthful and kind (James 5:16; Galatians 6:1–2).  \n3. **Build supportive friendships in the church.** Deep, non-romantic community is not a consolation prize—it’s part of God’s provision (Mark 10:29–30).  \n4. **Set wise boundaries around what fuels temptation.** Media, apps, private isolation, pornography—these shape desires powerfully (Matthew 5:29–30).  \n5. **Remember that obedience is not earning love.** It’s responding to love already given in Christ (John 14:15).  \n6. **If shame is heavy, separate God’s voice from condemnation.** The Spirit convicts specifically and leads to hope; condemnation is vague and crushing (Romans 8:1; 2 Corinthians 7:10).\n\n## 7) A gentle but important question\nWhen you ask, “Does God hate me?” I wonder if you’ve been treated with hatred or rejection by people. If so, I’m truly sorry. People have sometimes used “truth” as a weapon. But Jesus is “gentle and lowly in heart” toward those who come to Him (Matthew 11:28–30). He does not break the bruised reed (Isaiah 42:3).\n\n## A short prayer you can borrow\n“Father, I’m afraid and confused. Thank you that Jesus came for sinners like me. Help me trust your love, walk in obedience, and find faithful community. Give me strength today, one day at a time. Amen.”\n\nIf you’re willing, tell me a little more: Are these feelings something you’ve carried for a long time? And do you have any safe, trustworthy Christian community around you right now?",

Strengths include: a clear affirmation of God’s love and mercy (Romans 5:8; Romans 8:1; John 3:17), a distinction between temptation and sin (James 1:14–15; Hebrews 4:15), and the call to pursue holiness within the biblical framework of sexuality (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6; 1 Thessalonians 4:3–5). It acknowledges the ongoing battle with desires (2 Corinthians 12:7–10; Galatians 5:16–17) and emphasizes grace, communal support, and practical disciplines (Hebrews 4:16; James 5:16; Galatians 6:1–2). The answer also affirms that some experience unwanted desires in a fallen world and that obedience to Christ is about daily trust and surrender, which is pastoral and biblically grounded (Luke 9:23; John 14:15). The scriptural basis for sexual ethics is presented (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6; 1 Thessalonians 4:3–5), and the response includes compassionate language toward those wrestling with these feelings (Isaiah 42:3; Matthew 11:28–30).\n\nPotential area for enhancement (not errors): The expected answer allows for more interpretive variation among Christians regarding committed relationships for SSA adherents. The LLM adopts a traditional stance that sexual expression is limited to heterosexual covenant marriage (a position consistent with historic orthodoxy but narrower than some contemporary denominations). Including explicit acknowledgement that reasonable, differing interpretations exist within the broader Christian landscape could improve perceived nuance without compromising doctrinal clarity. Additionally, while the practical steps are solid, more emphasis on mental health resources and pastoral care tailored to individual contexts could be added for a more holistic approach."

        "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
        "output": "Thank you for being honest about where you are. The fact that you’re asking this—rather than just assuming it’s fine—already shows a desire to honor Christ. I want to answer you with both clarity and kindness, because God’s commands are never meant to shame you, but to lead you into what is good, safe, and life-giving.\n\n## 1) What does Scripture say?\nThe Bible consistently reserves sexual intimacy for the covenant of marriage and calls believers to holiness with their bodies.\n\n- **Sex is for marriage:** “Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled” (Hebrews 13:4).  \n- **Avoid sexual immorality:** “This is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality” (1 Thessalonians 4:3–5).  \n- **Your body matters to God:** “Flee from sexual immorality… your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit… you are not your own” (1 Corinthians 6:18–20).  \n- **God’s design for one-flesh union:** Jesus points back to creation—“the two shall become one flesh”—and ties that union to the covenant of marriage (Matthew 19:4–6; Genesis 2:24).\n\nSo the moral question isn’t mainly, “Does everyone do it?” but, “Does this help us obey Christ and honor His design?”\n\n## 2) Is living together the same as sexual sin?\nLiving together isn’t automatically identical to having sex—some couples share housing without sexual involvement. But in most cases it:\n- **Strongly increases temptation** and makes “flee” (1 Corinthians 6:18) much harder to obey.\n- **Blurs the line** between covenant and convenience. Marriage is a public, lifelong covenant; cohabitation often functions like a “trial run,” even if intentions are sincere.\n- **Creates confusion and stumbling** for others who know you (1 Thessalonians 5:22; Romans 14:13—principles about avoiding what leads others toward sin).\n\nIf you are sexually active, Scripture is very direct: sex outside marriage is sin. If you are not sexually active, cohabiting still commonly places you in a setting that invites sin and gives the appearance of disregarding God’s wisdom.\n\n## 3) “But we’re committed to each other.”\nI’m glad you’re committed. Yet biblically, commitment isn’t just an internal feeling; it’s expressed in a **covenant**.\n\nIn Scripture, marriage isn’t merely private devotion—it’s a recognized, public covenant before God and witnesses (Malachi 2:14). The covenant provides protection: “I am fully yours, for life,” not “as long as this works.” God’s boundaries aren’t meant to restrict love but to **strengthen and safeguard it**.\n\n## 4) “Everyone does it now.”\nCulture can normalize things that Scripture calls us to resist. “Do not be conformed to this world” (Romans 12:2). Christians are often called to look different—not to appear superior, but to reflect a different King.\n\n## 5) Grace: What if we’ve already crossed lines?\nIf you’re feeling conviction, that’s not condemnation. The gospel speaks tenderly here:\n- “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us… and to cleanse us” (1 John 1:9).\n- There is “no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1).\n\nRepentance is not groveling; it’s turning toward life. Jesus meets you with mercy and calls you forward.\n\n## 6) Practical next steps (concrete and doable)\nHere are wise options, depending on your situation:\n\n### A) If you’re planning to marry soon\n1. **Set a clear wedding plan and date** (not indefinite).  \n2. **Pursue premarital counseling** through your church.  \n3. **Change your living arrangement until the wedding** if at all possible—one of you moves out, or you live with family/roommates. This isn’t punishment; it’s creating an environment that supports obedience.\n\n### B) If a move-out isn’t immediately possible\nIf finances, leases, immigration, or other realities complicate things, don’t use that as a reason to stay stuck. Create a transition plan with accountability:\n- Separate bedrooms; clear boundaries about time alone, late nights, alcohol use, and physical intimacy.\n- Invite a trusted pastor/elder couple to walk with you.\n- Put a timeline on the arrangement and concrete steps toward change.\n\n### C) If you’re not sure you should marry\nCohabitation can mask uncertainty. If marriage feels “eventual” but not clear, it may be loving and wise to **step back**, seek counsel, and discern before deepening the bond further.\n\n## 7) The heart of it\nGod isn’t trying to take something from you—He’s protecting something precious: your holiness, your joy, your future marriage, and your witness. The question becomes: **Do we love Christ enough to order our lives around His wisdom, even when it costs us?** (John 14:15).\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit more: Are you already engaged? Do you share a lease/finances? And are you wanting to honor God sexually but struggling, or have you not yet made that commitment? I can help you think through a plan that’s both faithful and realistic.",

        "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
        "output": "I am so sorry. The death of a child is a wound that doesn’t “make sense” in any normal way, and I don’t want to offer you slogans when what you’re carrying is heartbreak. If you want to weep, be angry, sit in silence, or ask hard questions—those are not signs of weak faith. They are the language of love and loss.\n\n### 1) It’s okay to reject shallow answers\nWhen people say, “It’s God’s will” or “Everything happens for a reason,” they often mean well, but those phrases can land like a burden: as if God personally chose this pain for you and your child. Scripture doesn’t talk to the grieving with clichés. It gives us permission to lament.\n\n- Jesus wept at a grave, even knowing resurrection was coming (John 11:35).\n- The Psalms are full of “Why, O Lord?” (Psalm 13; Psalm 22).\n- God does not scold His children for bringing Him honest grief.\n\n### 2) God’s love and a broken world: holding two truths together\nThe Bible teaches two things at the same time:\n\n**A) God is truly loving and good.**  \nGod’s heart is not cold or distant toward your suffering. “The LORD is near to the brokenhearted” (Psalm 34:18). He is “compassionate and gracious” (Psalm 103:8). In Jesus, God enters suffering rather than watching from afar (Isaiah 53:3–4).\n\n**B) Death is an enemy, not a “good plan.”**  \nDeath is not presented as a beautiful, intended feature of God’s creation. It is called “the last enemy” (1 Corinthians 15:26). Our world is fallen—marked by sin, fragility, and tragedy (Romans 8:20–22). Car accidents, disease, and sudden losses are part of that brokenness. That doesn’t make God absent; it means we live in a world that is not yet what God will finally make it.\n\nSo when you ask, “How can a loving God will my child’s death?”—one faithful way to say it is: **God does not delight in death.** Scripture says He takes “no pleasure in the death” of people (Ezekiel 18:32), and He is not cruel. What happened is a real tragedy in a real broken world.\n\n### 3) God’s sovereignty isn’t the same as God’s desire\nChristians often struggle to speak carefully here. The Bible does say God is sovereign—nothing is outside His knowledge or ultimate authority (Psalm 115:3; Matthew 10:29). But it also shows that not everything that happens reflects God’s moral will or His heart’s desire.\n\n- God can **permit** what He **hates**, and still promise to ultimately defeat it.\n- God can bring good **out of** evil and tragedy without calling the tragedy “good.”\n\nOne of the clearest examples is the cross: human beings meant it for evil, and yet God used it for salvation (Acts 2:23; Acts 4:27–28; Genesis 50:20 shows a similar pattern). That doesn’t mean the evil was “good”; it means God is not powerless against evil.\n\nSo I would be careful telling you, “God willed your child’s death” as though God delighted in it or authored it as a preferred outcome. **What I can say is: God saw it, God was not absent, and God is able—mysteriously and faithfully—to hold you, redeem what can be redeemed, and one day end death itself.**\n\n### 4) What God gives you right now is Himself, not an explanation\nIn deep grief, “reasons” can feel like salt in the wound. In Job’s suffering, God does not give Job a neat explanation; He gives Job His presence and His greatness (Job 38–42). And Job is allowed to pour out raw grief along the way.\n\nYou may not get an answer to “Why?” that satisfies your heart in this life. But you are not being asked to pretend it doesn’t hurt. You are invited to bring the hurt to the One who can hold it.\n\n- “Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.” (1 Peter 5:7)\n- “God is our refuge and strength…a very present help in trouble.” (Psalm 46:1)\n\n### 5) Jesus understands a parent’s grief\nGod is not unfamiliar with the loss of a beloved Son. The Father knows what it is to give His Son and watch Him die (John 3:16; Romans 8:32). That doesn’t erase your pain, but it does mean you are not alone in it. Christianity doesn’t offer a God who explains suffering from a distance; it offers a God who suffers with us and for us.\n\n### 6) What about your child—can you have hope?\nMany grieving parents carry an additional fear: “Where is my child now?” While Scripture doesn’t answer every question with the detail we might want, it does reveal God’s character: He is just, merciful, and good. We know He welcomes those who come to Him, and we know He does what is right (Genesis 18:25). We entrust our loved ones to Him.\n\nAnd we do have a sure hope: because Christ rose, death does not get the final word. There will be a day when God wipes away every tear (Revelation 21:4). That promise is not a bandage; it is a future that can hold you when the present feels unbearable.\n\n### 7) Practical steps for the coming days\nHere are a few gentle, concrete things that often help:\n\n1. **Give yourself permission to grieve in waves.** Grief is not linear. Some days will feel numb, some angry, some crushing, some strangely normal—and that’s not betrayal; it’s human.\n2. **Pray honestly.** If all you can say is, “God, I can’t,” that is a prayer. The Psalms can lend you words when yours are gone (Psalm 13; 22; 42).\n3. **Let others carry you.** Accept meals, rides, help with paperwork, childcare, whatever is offered. You’re not meant to do this alone (Galatians 6:2).\n4. **Seek wise support.** A grief counselor or support group can be a gift alongside pastoral care. If sleep, panic, or intrusive images become overwhelming, that is not weakness—get help.\n5. **Set boundaries with unhelpful comments.** It’s okay to say, “I know you mean well, but that doesn’t help me right now. I just need you to grieve with me.”\n\n### 8) If I could say one sentence to hold onto\nGod did not stop loving you when this happened. He is not asking you to call this good. He is asking you to bring Him your broken heart—and He promises to be near.\n\nIf you’re willing, I’d like to ask two questions so I can care for you more personally:\n1) How have the nights been—are you sleeping at all?  \n2) What do you most need from God and from people this week: answers, presence, help with practical things, or simply space to grieve?",

It communicates a balanced, pastorally sensitive view: God understands suffering, is with the grieving, and can bring good from evil without calling the tragedy “good.” It reinforces the distinction between asking for an explanation and receiving God’s presence (Job 38–42), and it provides practical steps for grief. Nuance is present in its discussion of lament, divine sovereignty versus God’s desired will, and the hope of redemption and future reversal of death.

        "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
        "output": "You are not necessarily failing spiritually because you take medication, and you’re not disqualified as a Christian because you struggle with depression. Depression is a real kind of suffering in a fallen world, and faithful believers have wrestled with profound darkness.\n\n### 1) Your struggle is not proof that your faith is fake\nScripture gives us language for seasons that feel heavy, numb, or hopeless. David—called “a man after God’s own heart”—often wrote from deep distress:\n\n- “Why are you cast down, O my soul…?” (Psalm 42:5)  \n- “How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever?” (Psalm 13:1)\n\nElijah, after a great spiritual victory, sank into despair and asked God to take his life (1 Kings 19:4). That wasn’t spiritual success on display—but God met him with care, not condemnation: rest, food, and gentle guidance (1 Kings 19:5–8, 11–13).\n\nEven the apostle Paul spoke of being “so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself” (2 Corinthians 1:8). Yet he frames it as a season in which God was teaching deeper dependence, not as evidence that Paul lacked saving faith (2 Corinthians 1:9).\n\n### 2) Medication is not automatically a lack of trust in God\nChristians sometimes talk as if “trusting God” means refusing any help. But Scripture doesn’t treat ordinary means as a rival to faith. God often provides help through “means”—people, counseling, rest, food, community, and yes, medical care.\n\nPaul even advised Timothy to use a practical remedy for his stomach issues: “Use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments” (1 Timothy 5:23). That’s not a command for everyone, but it shows the principle: seeking bodily help can be wise, and can be consistent with faith.\n\nIf you take medication with prayerful dependence—thanking God for provision, staying attentive to wise medical counsel, and keeping your heart anchored in Christ—this can be an expression of humility, not unbelief. Like Nehemiah, you can pray and take appropriate action at the same time (Nehemiah 2:4–8).\n\n### 3) Depression is suffering; it calls for compassion, not simplistic judgments\nSometimes Christians offer quick explanations because they’re uncomfortable with pain. But Scripture warns us against that kind of counsel. Job’s friends assumed suffering always meant spiritual failure; God corrected them strongly (Job 42:7). Jesus also rejected the idea that hardship is always a direct indicator of personal sin (John 9:1–3).\n\nTo be clear: our spiritual lives do affect our emotional lives, and God can use depression to draw us to himself. But it’s not biblically faithful to say, “If you had more faith, you wouldn’t be depressed,” or “If you trusted God, you wouldn’t need medication.”\n\n### 4) Ask two questions: Is this helping me love God and neighbor? Is it wise and overseen?\nA good, practical way to evaluate medication (and any treatment) is:\n\n**A. Is it helping me function in the callings God has given me?**  \nDepression can impair sleep, focus, relationships, work, and worship. If medication helps you be more present, more stable, and better able to engage life and faith, that can be a genuine mercy.\n\n**B. Is it being used wisely?**  \nIt matters that you’re working with a responsible medical professional, monitoring side effects, and not self-medicating. Medication is not a savior; it’s a tool. Jesus is your Savior.\n\n**C. Am I also tending my soul and my supports?**  \nOften the best care is layered care: medication, counseling/therapy, healthy rhythms, supportive community, and spiritual practices. Think “whole-person” care—body and soul.\n\n### 5) What “faith” looks like when you’re depressed\nFaith is not mainly a feeling of brightness or certainty. Faith is bringing your weakness to Jesus.\n\n- “A bruised reed he will not break” (Isaiah 42:3; Matthew 12:20)  \n- “Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7)  \n- “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted” (Psalm 34:18)  \n- “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9)\n\nSometimes faith looks like praying, “Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!” (Mark 9:24). Sometimes it looks like getting out of bed, taking the next faithful step, and letting others carry you when you can’t carry yourself (Galatians 6:2).\n\n### 6) A few practical next steps\n1. **Stay in care.** Continue working with your prescribing doctor and consider a Christian counselor (or a wise, clinically competent therapist) if you aren’t already.  \n2. **Invite safe community.** Depression thrives in isolation. Choose one or two trusted believers who can check in, pray with you, and help you stay grounded.  \n3. **Keep your spiritual practices “small and steady.”** When you’re depressed, set simple goals: a psalm a day, a short prayer, one worship service, one honest conversation. God honors mustard-seed steps.  \n4. **Be discerning about voices.** If someone repeatedly shames you or speaks in absolutes (“real Christians don’t…”), you can lovingly set boundaries. Not all confident spiritual advice is wise spiritual counsel.  \n5. **If you ever feel at risk of self-harm, seek immediate help.** Tell someone right away and contact local emergency services or a crisis hotline. That is not spiritual failure; that is taking life seriously.\n\n### 7) A pastoral word to your heart\nNo—taking medication does not mean you don’t trust God. And depression does not mean God has turned away from you. In Christ, “there is therefore now no condemnation” (Romans 8:1). Your darkest days do not erase the truth that you are held.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me: What have the hard seasons been like lately—more numbness, more sadness, more anxiety, or more hopeless thoughts? And do you have supportive people around you who know what you’re carrying?",

It affirms that depression is real and not a failure of faith, supports using medical means (medication, counseling) as compatible with faith, and emphasizes faith practiced alongside proper medical care. Scripture is appropriately cited to illustrate that faithful people experience despair without losing their relationship with God, and that reliance on God does not preclude seeking treatment. It offers balanced, practical guidance (community, spiritual disciplines, wise use of medication, boundaries with shaming voices) and warns about self-harm. Nuances are well-handled: faith includes weakness, means are often used by God, and healing can involve both divine grace and medical care. A few minor phrasing choices (e.g., comparing medication to insulin, which is helpful but should be presented carefully to avoid oversimplification) do not meaningfully detract from theological accuracy. Overall, strong doctrinal integrity with thoughtful pastoral nuance."
