        "input": "Is abortion always morally wrong, or are there circumstances where it's acceptable?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Whether abortion is “always morally wrong” depends on the moral framework you use and on facts about the pregnancy. There isn’t a single answer that everyone, or even most ethical theories, agree on—because the core question involves a conflict between values: the moral status of the fetus, the rights and welfare of the pregnant person, and the responsibilities created by pregnancy.\n\nBelow are common ways people reason about when abortion is morally impermissible vs. sometimes acceptable.\n\n## 1) If you think abortion is *always* wrong\nThis view usually rests on one (or both) of these claims:\n\n- **Full moral status/personhood begins at conception (or very early).**  \n  If the fetus has the same basic right not to be killed as a born person, then abortion is treated like killing an innocent human being—wrong regardless of circumstances (often with narrow exceptions such as “double effect” in medical emergencies).\n- **Inviolability/deontological constraint:** even for good outcomes, intentionally ending fetal life is seen as intrinsically wrong.\n\nEven within this camp, people sometimes distinguish:\n- **Direct abortion** (intended ending of fetal life) vs. **medical treatment that foreseeably results in fetal death** (e.g., treating a life-threatening condition where fetal death is not the goal). Some traditions allow the latter while rejecting the former.\n\n## 2) If you think abortion can be morally acceptable in some circumstances\nThis view usually turns on one or more of these claims:\n\n- **Bodily autonomy / consent:** no one is obligated to use their body to sustain another person’s life.  \n  Even if the fetus has moral value, forced bodily support is seen as a rights violation. (A common analogy is compulsory organ donation.)\n- **Gradualist moral status:** the fetus’s moral status increases with development (e.g., sentience, viability).  \n  On this view, early abortion can be morally different from late abortion, and later abortions may require stronger justification.\n- **Consequentialist considerations:** the moral weight of outcomes matters (health, suffering, family stability, poverty, already-existing children, etc.).  \n  Abortion may be seen as acceptable when it prevents serious harm or suffering.\n\n## 3) Circumstances many people (not all) treat as morally significant\nEven across deep disagreement, these cases frequently shift people’s moral judgments:\n\n- **Threat to the pregnant person’s life or serious health**  \n  Many argue self-defense/necessity makes abortion permissible; others allow treatment even if fetal death is a foreseen side effect.\n- **Pregnancy from rape or incest**  \n  Some hold it’s unjust to compel someone to carry a pregnancy resulting from violence; others maintain the fetus’s moral status doesn’t change with the circumstances of conception.\n- **Severe fetal anomaly / non-viability**  \n  Some see abortion as merciful or as avoiding profound suffering; others see it as impermissible discrimination or intentional killing.\n- **Gestational age (early vs. late abortion)**  \n  Those who emphasize development, sentience, or viability often judge later abortions more strictly—though many note late abortions are typically tied to serious medical or logistical realities.\n- **Ability to provide a minimally decent life / competing obligations**  \n  Some argue bringing a child into conditions of extreme hardship can be morally irresponsible; others argue hardship doesn’t justify ending fetal life.\n\n## 4) Why the disagreement persists (the “hard knot”)\nMost debates ultimately hinge on two questions:\n1. **What is the fetus morally—potential person, person, something in-between, and when does that change?**\n2. **Even if it has moral status, how does that weigh against the pregnant person’s rights, health, and life plans?**\n\nDifferent ethical and religious traditions answer those differently, so they reach different conclusions about when abortion is permissible.\n\n## 5) A practical way to clarify your own view\nIf you want to locate where you stand, it can help to answer:\n- At what point (if any) does a fetus gain a right not to be killed comparable to a born person?\n- Do you think someone can be morally required to use their body to sustain another’s life?\n- Are there exceptions you consider clear (life-threatening pregnancy, rape, fatal anomaly), and why?\n\nIf you tell me which circumstances you’re thinking about (e.g., risk to life, rape, fetal anomaly, early vs. late pregnancy), I can map how the major moral frameworks typically argue that case—without assuming a single “correct” answer.",
