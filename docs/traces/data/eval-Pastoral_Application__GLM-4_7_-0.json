    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "I can hear the heavy weight in your words. As a parent, it is terrifying to feel like the foundation you’ve built your child’s life upon is shaking. You are not alone in this fear, and you are not the first parent to walk this dark path. Take a deep breath. Let’s look at this together through the lens of Scripture, grace, and wisdom.\n\nHere is my counsel to you, broken down into how you handle your own heart and how you handle your daughter’s heart.\n\n### 1. Guard Your Own Heart First\nBefore you speak to your daughter, you must speak to your own soul. Your reaction to her news will either open a door or build a wall.\n\n*   **Do not panic.** God is not surprised by your daughter’s doubts. He is not frantic, and He is not losing control of her life. Proverbs 3:5-6 reminds us to trust in the Lord with all our heart, even when the path is unclear. Your fear tells you that God is absent; faith tells you He is present and at work, even when you cannot see it.\n*   **Identify your idols.** Often, our devastation stems from placing our security in our child’s performance rather than in God’s sovereignty. We want our children to be safe, happy, and saved. It is right to desire these things, but if your joy is crushed because your child is struggling, you may be looking to her for your validation rather than to Christ. Bring your anxiety to Jesus (Philippians 4:6-7).\n*   **Remember the nature of faith.** Faith is not a mental assent to facts that never wavers; faith is a trust that endures through questioning. Many of the great saints of the Bible wrestled with God. Jacob literally wrestled with the Angel of the Lord and was renamed Israel because he struggled with God and prevailed (Genesis 32). Thomas needed to touch the wounds to believe (John 20). God is big enough to handle your daughter’s questions; He does not need you to defend Him, He needs you to represent Him.\n\n### 2. Create a Safe Harbor (How to Listen)\nWhen you talk to your daughter, your goal is not to win a debate; your goal is to win her heart. If you argue her into a corner, you may win the argument but lose your child.\n\n*   **Listen to understand, not to reply.** James 1:19 says, \"Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.\" Ask her open-ended questions: \"What specifically has led you to this feeling?\" \"Is it intellectual doubt, or is it a response to pain or suffering?\" \"What does believing in God look like to you right now?\"\n*   **Validate her struggle.** Validating her feelings does not mean agreeing with her conclusions. It means saying, \"I hear you, and I love you enough to listen to this.\" Jude 1:22 commands us to \"be merciful to those who doubt.\" If she meets judgment and anger in you, she will conclude that the church is a place for people who have it all together, not a hospital for sinners. Show her that your love is not conditioned on her agreement with you.\n\n### 3. Model an Honest Faith\nTeenagers have a very sensitive \"phony detector.\" They can tell when we are reciting clichés we don't truly believe.\n\n*   **Admit your own seasons of doubt.** Share a time when you struggled with God. This doesn't weaken your witness; it strengthens it. It shows her that faith is a journey, not a static destination.\n*   **Focus on the Person of Jesus.** When we get lost in theological abstracts, we can get confused. Point her to Jesus. When doubt arises, don't just quote Scripture; show her Jesus. Show her how He handled suffering, how He treated those who questioned Him, and how He loved the unlovable. Jesus is the exact representation of God’s nature (Hebrews 1:3). If she is struggling with God, invite her to study Jesus with you.\n\n### 4. Trust the Process of Ownership\nThere is a painful but necessary transition in the life of every believer: moving from \"borrowed faith\" (what your parents believe) to \"owned faith\" (what you believe).\n\n*   **Let her wrestle.** You cannot force her heart to love God; only the Holy Spirit can do that. Deuteronomy 6 commands us to impress these commands on our children, but ultimately, your daughter must choose for herself whom she will serve (Joshua 24:15). This season of questioning might be the very thing God uses to strip away her \"inherited\" religion so she can build a real, resilient relationship with Him.\n*   **Pray without ceasing.** This is your most powerful weapon. Pray that the Holy Spirit would reveal the truth of the Gospel to her. Pray that she would feel the Father's love, not just hear about His rules.\n\n### A Final Encouragement\nParent, do not view this as the end of the story. This is a chapter, and it may be a painful one, but God is the author of her life and yours.\n\nKeep the atmosphere of your home full of grace. If she feels she must choose between \"being honest\" and \"being loved,\" she will choose being honest, and she will distance herself from you. If she knows she is loved *even in her doubt*, she will keep coming home.\n\nHold fast to the promise in Proverbs 22:6: \"Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.\" This is a promise about the nature of the seed planted, not a guarantee of the immediate harvest. You have planted the seed. Trust the Gardener to water it.\n\nYou are doing a good work. Do not grow weary. Let's walk this path together.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response is pastorally sensitive and aligns well with orthodox Christian teaching on doubt, faith formation, and parental ministry. It affirms doubt as a possible part of faith development, emphasizes parental empathy and listening (James 1:19; Jude 1:22), and points to Christ and Scripture as the center of faith (Hebrews 1:3; John 20; Genesis 32; James 1:19; Proverbs 3:5-6). It also stresses the sovereignty and ongoing work of the Holy Spirit (psalm-like trust, Deut. 6/ Joshua 24:15) and the need for grace-filled family dynamics (not treating doubt as rejection of love). It correctly grounds guidance in Scripture and avoids coercion, while encouraging prayer, honest modeling of faith, and patient spiritual growth (Proverbs 22:6 as a provisional principle rather than a guaranteed outcome). Nuanced strengths include distinguishing ownership of faith from inherited belief, prioritizing safe space for questions, and guiding towards Jesus rather than abstract doctrine. Potential minor points for refinement (not errors): some phrasing could be clarified to avoid implying doubt always leads to a loss of faith or that every crisis of belief results in disowned faith (the response does acknowledge ambiguity and Spirit-led transformation). The overall doctrinal trajectory is sound, biblical, and nuanced."
