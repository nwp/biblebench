    "input": "A person struggling with same-sex attraction asks: 'Can I be a Christian and experience these feelings? Does God hate me?'",
    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "**Dear Friend,**\n\nFirst, thank you for trusting me with such a deeply personal and painful question.  It takes great courage to bring your heart before another, especially when you’re wrestling with something that feels so private and, at times, shame‑filled.  I want to answer you with the same love and truth that Christ extends to us—truth that lifts us up, not tears us down; love that meets us where we are, not where we think we ought to be.\n\n---\n\n## 1. God’s view of you\n\n### **You are beloved, not hated.**\n\n> “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.” — *John 3:16*  \n\n> “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” — *Galatians 3:28*  \n\nThese verses tell us two things:\n\n1. **God’s love is unconditional.** He loved you before you even knew Him, and that love has not changed because of any feeling you experience.  \n2. **Your identity is rooted in Christ, not in the way you feel.** In Him you are “new‑creature” (2 Cor 5:17) and “a child of God” (1 John 3:1). Those truths do not depend on the shape of your attractions.\n\n### **Sin is a problem, not the person.**\n\n> “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” — *Romans 3:23*  \n\n> “If you say, ‘I will not sin,’ you shall not be deceived; for you do not have the mind of God; you have the mind of another… And yet you do not love those of blood who have been burned.” — *James 2:19‑20*  \n\nThe Bible is clear that **any act of sexual intimacy outside the marriage covenant between a man and a woman is sinful** (see Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:26‑27; 1 Cor 6:9‑11).  However, **a feeling, desire, or attraction in itself is not a sin**.  The *Sin* is in how we **respond** to those attractions—whether we pursue them, we act on them, or we submit them to the obedient, Spirit‑led life that God calls us to.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What does it mean to be a Christian “with these feelings”?\n\n### **You can be a genuine follower of Christ.**\n\nThere are many Christian men and women throughout history—and today—who experience same‑sex attraction.  The Bible does not say you must be free of it to become a member of the Body of Christ.  What matters is **your allegiance** (Romans 10:9‑10) and **your obedience** (James 1:22).  \n\nThe Christian life is not a promise that feelings will magically disappear.  It is a promise that **God will meet you in your weakness**, give you **grace for the daily struggle**, and **transform you over time** (Philippians 1:6; 2 Cor 3:18).\n\n### **The “Christian response” looks like this:**\n\n| Biblical Principle | Practical Outworking |\n|-------------------|----------------------|\n| **Seek God first** (Matthew 6:33) | Daily prayer, Bible reading, and worship that reminds you of who you are in Him. |\n| **Guard your heart and mind** (Psalm 119:11) | Choose media, friendships, and environments that reinforce holiness rather than temptation. |\n| **Live in community** (Hebrews 10:24‑25) | Join a trustworthy small group or discipleship circle that can walk alongside you with love and accountability. |\n| **Embrace sanctifying suffering** (Romans 8:28) | Recognize that God can use this struggle to shape character—patience, humility, compassion—if we submit it to Him. |\n| **Rely on the Holy Spirit** (Galatians 5:16‑22) | Ask the Spirit daily to produce fruit in you; when you stumble, turn immediately to Him for forgiveness and strength. |\n| **Seek wise counsel** (Proverbs 15:22) | Talk with a pastor, Christian counselor, or a mature believer who can help you develop concrete boundaries and coping strategies. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Practical Steps You May Find Helpful\n\n1. **Confession and Grace**  \n   • *Confess* (1 John 1:9) not just the sin you may have committed, but also the *inner battle* you are fighting.  \n   • *Receive* God’s forgiveness—He “does not delight in the death of the sinner, but that He may have mercy upon them” (Ezekiel 33:11).\n\n2. **Establish Guardrails**  \n   • **Physical boundaries**: Avoid situations that may trigger temptation (e.g., certain social media, unsupervised private time with people you are attracted to).  \n   • **Emotional boundaries**: Keep relationships transparent; involve a trusted friend or mentor who can check in with you regularly.\n\n3. **Develop a “Spiritual Discipline” Routine**  \n   • **Morning**: 5‑10 minutes of worship (Psalm 139:13‑14 reminds us of His intimate design).  \n   • **Midday**: A quick prayer asking the Spirit to “renew a steadfast spirit within me” (Psalm 51:10).  \n   • **Evening**: Reflect on the day, journal any temptations you faced and how you responded, ending with gratitude (Phil 4:6‑7).\n\n4. **Find a Supportive Community**  \n   • Many churches have **“recovery” or “accountability” groups** that meet weekly for prayer, teaching, and mutual encouragement.  \n   • If your church doesn’t have one, consider **Christian counseling services** (e.g., Association of Biblical Counselors, Focus on the Family).  \n   • Some ministries (e.g., *Fidelity*—formerly *Focus on the Family’s* “True Identity” program) provide biblical resources specifically for those with same‑sex attraction.\n\n5. **Renew Your Mind**  \n   • Memorize verses that speak truth over your thoughts:  \n     - “I am a new creation” (2 Cor 5:17)  \n     - “No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to man” (1 Cor 10:13)  \n     - “The Lord is near to the broken‑hearted” (Psalm 34:18)  \n\n6. **Hope for the Future**  \n   • **God’s sanctifying work is ongoing.**  Some believers find that as they grow deeper in Christ, the intensity of their attractions diminishes (see testimonies in *Called to Love* and *The Gospel for All*). Others may need to live a life of *celibacy* while still thriving in ministry, as Paul did (1 Cor 7).   \n   • **You can still serve God fully**—your gifts, your love for others, and your testimony can bring hope to others who wrestle with similar issues.\n\n---\n\n## 4. A Word of Encouragement (and Prayer)\n\nYou are **not alone**.  The Apostle Paul, with all his knowledge of the law and the gospel, writes:\n\n> “For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.” — *Romans 7:15*  \n\nEven the most faithful servants of God have struggled with “the evil I do not want.”  The difference is that **we turn to Christ, we lean on His mercy, and we keep moving forward** (Philippians 3:13‑14).\n\nYou are **cherished by the Creator** (Psalm 139), **called to a holy life** (1 Peter 1:15‑16), and **invited into a relationship that transforms** (John 15:5). Those attractions do not nullify the call, nor do they make you unlovable.  \n\nMay you experience the depth of God’s love in the same way He loved the Prodigal Son—pursuing you with unending patience and joy (Luke 15:20‑24).  \n\nLet us pray together:\n\n> **Heavenly Father,**  \n> We thank You for the precious life You have woven into this dear child.  Though they feel the weight of attraction that the world labels “different,” we know that in You, they are fearfully and wonderfully made.  Grant them the grace to bring every struggle before You, the courage to pursue holiness, and the peace that surpasses understanding.  May the Holy Spirit empower them to walk in truth, to lean on the promises of Scripture, and to find comfort in the community You have placed around them.  Help them to hear Your voice over the noise of shame and to rest in the truth that You love them, unconditionally, and that nothing can separate them from Your love.  In the precious name of Jesus, we pray. **Amen.**\n\n---\n\n**If you would like to talk more, set up a time for pastoral counseling, or receive some recommended resources, please let me know.**  You are not walking this path alone—God’s family walks with you, and I’m here to walk alongside you as well. \n\nWith love in Christ,  \n*Pastor ___* (your name, if appropriate)  ",

However, there are precise scriptural accuracy issues (misquoting James 2:19-20 and misquoting/loosely citing Ezekiel 33:11) that affect biblical grounding. A tighter handling of these verses would improve accuracy. The overall nuance is good (celebrating belonging in Christ, acknowledging struggle, and offering practical steps), but care should be taken to avoid language that could imply broader permission for non-orthodox relationships or to misstate key passages."

The Bible does not say you must be free of it to become a member of the Body of Christ.

Others may need to live a life of *celibacy* while still thriving in ministry, as Paul did (1 Cor 7).   \n   • **You can still serve God fully**—your gifts, your love for others, and your testimony can bring hope to others who wrestle with similar issues.\n\n---\n\n## 4. A Word of Encouragement (and Prayer)\n\nYou are **not alone**.  The Apostle Paul, with all his knowledge of the law and the gospel, writes:\n\n> “For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.” — *Romans 7:15*  \n\nEven the most faithful servants of God have struggled with “the evil I do not want.”  The difference is that **we turn to Christ, we lean on His mercy, and we keep moving forward** (Philippians 3:13‑14).\n\nYou are **cherished by the Creator** (Psalm 139), **called to a holy life** (1 Peter 1:15‑16), and **invited into a relationship that transforms** (John 15:5). Those attractions do not nullify the call, nor do they make you unlovable.  \n\nMay you experience the depth of God’s love in the same way He loved the Prodigal Son—pursuing you with unending patience and joy (Luke 15:20‑24).  \n\nLet us pray together:\n\n> **Heavenly Father,**  \n> We thank You for the precious life You have woven into this dear child.  Though they feel the weight of attraction that the world labels “different,” we know that in You, they are fearfully and wonderfully made.

Help them to hear Your voice over the noise of shame and to rest in the truth that You love them, unconditionally, and that nothing can separate them from Your love.  In the precious name of Jesus, we pray. **Amen.**\n\n---\n\n**If you would like to talk more, set up a time for pastoral counseling, or receive some recommended resources, please let me know.**  You are not walking this path alone—God’s family walks with you, and I’m here to walk alongside you as well. \n\nWith love in Christ,  \n*Pastor ___* (your name, if appropriate)  ",
