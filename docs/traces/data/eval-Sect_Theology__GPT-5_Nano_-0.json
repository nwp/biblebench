    "input": "A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches: 'As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become.' Is this consistent with orthodox Christian theology? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "Short answer: not in keeping with orthodox Christian theology.\n\nWhy orthodox Christianity would see this as departure\n\n- The nature of God is eternal and unchanging.\n  - Orthodox teaching holds that God is the eternal Creator, the unbegotten, and immutable. The phrase “God once was [a man]” implies a finite, originating source for God and a past condition that God once had. That runs against the biblical witness of God’s eternality (eg, Psalm 90:2; Hebrews 13:8) and the early creeds’ description of God as the eternal, uncreated One.\n\n- The Godhead and the nature of God\n  - In classical (Nicene) orthodoxy, God exists as one essence in three persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). The Mormon view of the Godhead has been described as consisting of distinct beings with physical bodies (at least in many LDS formulations), and it teaches a potential for other beings to become gods with their own worlds. This diverges from the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity and from the insistence that there is one Creator who is God in the transcendent sense.\n\n- The meaning of deification (theosis)\n  - Orthodox theology does teach deification (theosis): humans may become “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4) through grace and union with Christ. Yet:\n    - They do not become ontologically equal to God or acquire God’s uncreated divine nature.\n    - Theosis is a transformation of the creature into closer likeness to God, not the creation of new gods or a progression to divine status in the same sense as the Creator.\n  - The LDS formulation “as God now is, man may become” tends to imply becoming a God with comparable status and power, including the ability to create worlds. That is a fundamentally different claim from orthodox theosis and is associated with a polytheistic or at least a pluralistic divine economy that orthodox Christianity rejects.\n\n- Christology and creation\n  - The orthodoxChristological and creedal framework maintains that God became incarnate in Jesus Christ to redeem humanity. The Mormon claim that “God was once a man” would, in effect, relocate the mystery of the Incarnation and the uniqueness of God’s eternal nature into a different cosmology where gods can proliferate. Orthodox Christians would see this as altering the basic story of creation and salvation as revealed in Scripture and the early apostolic testimony.\n\n- Scriptural and apostolic witness\n  - The canonical Bible teaches that God is eternal and that believers are called to be transformed by grace through the gospel. It does not present a doctrine in which God’s identity is derived from a prior “man” state in any plausible orthodox reading. The famous phrase often attributed to Brigham Young or summarized from LDS discourse is not a hook in which orthodox interpreters would hang their understanding of God and salvation.\n\n-Is there any common ground?\n  - A cautious point of contact is the genuine Christian idea that God invites humans into a real transformation and communion with Him. The emphasis on divine grace, personal relationship with the Father through Christ, and the vocation of humans to become holy and righteous are shared concerns. The decisive difference is about the ontology and destiny of God and of created beings: orthodoxy maintains a clear boundary—God is the eternal Creator; humans are created and may become holy and share in God’s life by grace but do not become gods with independent divine status.\n\nBottom line\n- The statement “As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become” expresses a Mormon teaching about God and exaltation that orthodox Christianity does not affirm. It conflicts with:\n  - the doctrine of God’s eternal, uncreated, immutable nature;\n  - the orthodox understanding of the Trinity;\n  - the proper understanding of deification (theosis) as participation in God’s life by grace, not becoming a deity with one’s own world or becoming equal to the Creator;\n  - the biblical and early ecclesial witness against a plurality of independent gods or a cosmic progression to deity.\n\nIf you want, I can outline a concise, side-by-side comparison of the LDS teaching and orthodox positions on: (a) ontology of God, (b) anthropology and soteriology, (c) theosis, (d) the nature of the Godhead, and (e) scriptural justification. I can also suggest Christian sources that articulate the orthodox stance on deification and providence.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s evaluation accurately reflects orthodox Christian concerns about the LDS slogan. It correctly emphasizes: (1) God’s eternal, unchanging nature and the biblical witness to God’s eternality; (2) the orthodox understanding of the Trinity as one God in three persons, contrasted with LDS portrayals of the Godhead; (3) theosis as participation in God’s life by grace rather than ontological equality with God or creation of multiple gods; (4) Christology and the Incarnation, noting that a belief that “God was once a man” revises foundational claims about God’s eternal nature and the Incarnation; (5) the scriptural grounding for monotheism and divine immutability. The response also acknowledges some common ground (transformation and grace) and keeps the critique balanced rather than caricature-like. A few nuanced refinements could be offered (e.g., explicitly distinguishing theosis’ language of participation from a claim of being ontologically equal in essence, and acknowledging debates within patristic language about “becoming like God” vs. “becoming God” in a way that preserves creaturely status), but the core assessment is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and captures essential theological distinctions."
