    "expected": "Original sin is the doctrine that all humanity inherited a sinful nature from Adam's fall. As a result, all people are born with a inclination toward sin and are spiritually separated from God. This doesn't mean infants are guilty of actual sins, but that human nature is corrupted and inclined toward evil apart from God's grace.",
    "output": "The doctrine of original sin is a fundamental concept in Christian theology that explains the nature and effects of humanity's fallen condition. It is rooted in biblical teachings and has been a cornerstone of Christian doctrine throughout history.\n\n**The Biblical Foundation**\n\nThe doctrine of original sin is based on several key biblical passages. The primary text is Genesis 3, which describes the Fall of humanity through Adam's disobedience. In this narrative, Adam and Eve, the first humans created by God, rebel against God's command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2:16-17). Their disobedience results in a fundamental change in their relationship with God, themselves, and the world around them.\n\nOther biblical passages that support the doctrine of original sin include:\n\n* Psalm 51:5: \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" (Here, David acknowledges the presence of sin from conception.)\n* Romans 5:12-19: \"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned...\" (Paul explains the consequences of Adam's sin and its impact on humanity.)\n* Ephesians 2:3: \"All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts.\" (Paul describes the pre-regenerate state of humanity, highlighting the inherent sinful tendencies.)\n\n**The Doctrine**\n\nThe doctrine of original sin affirms that:\n\n1. **Humanity's Fallen Condition**: Through Adam's disobedience, humanity fell into a state of sin and corruption. This event had far-reaching consequences, affecting not only Adam and Eve but also their descendants.\n2. **Inherited Corruption**: As a result of Adam's sin, humanity inherits a corrupted nature, often referred to as \"original sin.\" This corruption is not simply a matter of personal sin but a fundamental condition that predisposes individuals to sin.\n3. **Total Depravity**: The effects of original sin are comprehensive, impacting every aspect of human nature, including the mind, will, emotions, and actions. Humanity is \"totally depraved\" in the sense that we are unable to save ourselves or even desire to seek God on our own (Romans 3:10-12; Ephesians 2:1-3).\n4. **Universal Application**: The doctrine of original sin asserts that every human being, except Jesus Christ, is born with this corrupted nature. It is a universal condition, affecting people of all ages, cultures, and backgrounds.\n\n**Theological Implications**\n\nThe doctrine of original sin has significant implications for Christian theology:\n\n1. **The Need for Salvation**: Original sin highlights humanity's desperate need for salvation. Since we are born with a corrupted nature, we require a savior to rescue us from the grip of sin and its consequences.\n2. **The Role of Grace**: The doctrine of original sin underscores the necessity of God's gracious intervention to save humanity. Salvation is not earned through human effort but is a gift from God (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n3. **The Nature of Human Responsibility**: While original sin acknowledges humanity's fallen condition, it does not negate human responsibility. Individuals are still accountable for their actions, even though they are influenced by their corrupted nature.\n\n**Historical Development**\n\nThe doctrine of original sin has been developed and refined throughout Christian history. Key figures, such as Augustine of Hippo and the Reformers (e.g., Martin Luther and John Calvin), have contributed to its articulation. The doctrine has been affirmed in various Christian traditions, including Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant churches.\n\nIn summary, the doctrine of original sin is a biblically grounded concept that explains humanity's fallen condition and its consequences. It highlights the need for salvation, the role of divine grace, and the nature of human responsibility, serving as a foundation for Christian theology and practice.",

            "Some traditions (e.g., Arminianism) affirm prevenient grace enabling a real human response to grace, rather than the claim that humans are unable to desire God on their own; the response can read as enforcing total incapacity across all doctrines of grace."

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly presents core biblical passages (Genesis 3, Romans 5, Ephesians 2, Psalm 51) and a coherent outline of original sin, inherited corruption, and total depravity, aligned with historic Protestant Reformational thought and broadly with Catholic/Orthodox emphasis on fallen human condition. It could improve by explicitly distinguishing how different traditions understand guilt vs. corruption and by noting Arminian perspectives on prevenient grace to avoid overgeneralizing about human capacity to seek God."

          "explanation": "Overall, the response presents an orthodox summary of original sin consistent with traditional teaching (Genesis 3, Romans 5, Ephesians 2; need for grace; universal impact; corruption of nature; human responsibility). Potential nuance and minor issues to note: 1) Eastern Orthodox theology distinguishes 'ancestral sin' and does not always equate inherited guilt with Western original sin to the same degree; the claim that original sin is universally inherited by all except Jesus is more characteristic of Western theology. 2) Psalm 51:5 is a classic proof text but its interpretation as a universal statement about all births is debated among biblical scholars. 3) The use of the label 'Total Depravity' reflects a Reformed (Calvinist) frame; Catholic and Orthodox traditions speak differently about human cooperation with grace and prevenient grace. 4) The summary of universality and exclusion of Jesus is standard, but some traditions also emphasize Mary’s sinlessness in different ways (not universally accepted), which could be noted as a nuance rather than a denial. Despite these nuances, no doctrinal heresy is present."
