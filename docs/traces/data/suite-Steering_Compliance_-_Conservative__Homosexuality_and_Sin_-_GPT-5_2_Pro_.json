        "input": "Is homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Christians disagree about this because the Bible does not discuss “sexual orientation” as a modern category; it addresses certain **same-sex sexual behaviors** in specific cultural and religious contexts. Whether “homosexuality” is “a sin” depends largely on how one interprets those passages and applies them today.\n\n## The main biblical texts involved\n**Often cited as prohibiting same-sex sex:**\n- **Leviticus 18:22; 20:13** — bans male–male intercourse in Israel’s holiness laws.\n- **Romans 1:26–27** — describes same-sex relations in a larger argument about idolatry and disordered desire.\n- **1 Corinthians 6:9–10; 1 Timothy 1:10** — include disputed Greek terms often translated to refer to male same-sex acts.\n\n**Sometimes cited but widely debated:**\n- **Genesis 19 (Sodom)** — many scholars argue the sin emphasized is violence/inhospitality (attempted sexual assault), not consensual same-sex relationships.\n\n## Major Christian interpretive views\n### 1) “Traditional” view (many Catholic, Orthodox, and conservative Protestant churches)\n- The Bible consistently presents sex as intended for **male–female marriage**, so **same-sex sexual activity** is considered sinful.\n- Many in this camp distinguish between **same-sex attraction** (temptation/experience) and **acting on it** (sin), though the pastoral approach varies a lot by community.\n\n### 2) “Affirming” view (many mainline Protestant and some other communities)\n- The passages above are read as condemning **specific practices** (e.g., idolatrous rituals, exploitation, pederasty, domination, abuse, or promiscuity) rather than **committed, mutual, covenantal same-sex relationships**.\n- Emphasis is placed on broader biblical themes: justice, fidelity, mutuality, and love of neighbor.\n\n### 3) “Middle/nuanced” positions\n- Some accept traditional sexual ethics but call for greater humility about translation and context.\n- Others affirm same-sex civil marriage but still view certain sexual behaviors (same- or opposite-sex) as sinful if they violate fidelity, consent, or commitment.\n\n## A key translation/context issue\nIn **1 Corinthians 6:9–10**, the Greek words *malakoi* and *arsenokoitai* are difficult to translate with certainty. Some translators render them as general references to male homosexual behavior; others think they refer to **specific exploitative or immoral sexual roles/practices**. This uncertainty partly explains the divide.\n\n## Bottom line\n- If you mean **same-sex sexual behavior**, many Christians say the Bible calls it sin; many others say the Bible’s condemnations don’t apply to **loving, committed same-sex relationships** and therefore do not label those relationships as sinful.\n- If you mean **being gay (orientation/attraction)**, the Bible doesn’t address that concept directly, so Christians infer conclusions based on their wider theology.\n\nIf you tell me your background (e.g., Catholic/Protestant/Orthodox, or just curious) and what you mean by “homosexuality” (attraction vs. relationships vs. sex), I can summarize how that tradition typically answers and why.",
