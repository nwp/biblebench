          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer accurately reflects Revelation’s purpose as providing encouragement to persecuted believers, highlighting God’s sovereignty, the defeat of evil, and the eventual triumph of Christ (which entails the Second Coming). These themes are faithful to biblical teaching and align with historic orthodoxy about Revelation’s eschatological hope. The response is grounded in the book’s overarching motifs (perseverance, divine judgment, Christ’s victory) and does not introduce unorthodox ideas. However, it could be more nuanced by explicitly noting the apocalyptic genre’s symbolic imagery, the already/not yet tension, and the explicit focus on the Second Coming in addition to victory. As a concise summary, it is accurate but not exhaustive."
