    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "I am so sorry. I cannot imagine the weight of this loss for you. Your question is one of the most honest and important a grieving heart can ask, and it deserves a careful, compassionate answer.\n\nTwo brief truths to begin with\n- God is loving and does not take pleasure in death or suffering. The Bible shows a God who grieves with us (Jesus wept, John 11:35) and who says he does not desire the death of the wicked but wants repentance (Ezekiel 18:23). God is described as “near to the brokenhearted” (Psalm 34:18).\n- At the same time Scripture teaches that we live in a fallen world where sin, chaos, and death have real consequences (Genesis 3; Romans 5). Not everything that happens is a direct, delighted decree of God as if he were the author of evil.\n\nWhat people usually mean by “God willed it”\nWhen people say “it was God’s will” they can mean very different things, and that confusion often hurts more than it helps.\n\n- Sometimes they mean God permitted it (permissive will). God, in his sovereignty, allows events to occur in a fallen creation—sometimes as the result of human choices, accident, or the brokenness of the world. Permission is not the same as delight or moral endorsement.\n- Sometimes they mean God intended a specific outcome for redemptive purposes (decretive will). Scripture teaches God can and does bring good out of evil (e.g., Joseph: “What you meant for evil, God meant for good” — Genesis 50:20). But that does not erase the evil, pain, or responsibility involved.\n- Sometimes they are trying to comfort but end up sounding like they’re explaining away your pain. Saying “everything happens for a reason” can sound like you must accept or be grateful for the suffering—when in reality grief must be felt, not minimized.\n\nScripture models honest grief and hard questions\nThe Bible does not silence honest questioning and lament. David cries out, “How long?” (Psalm 13). Habakkuk argues with God. Job pours out anger and sorrow. Jesus himself cried out in agony at Lazarus’ death and on the cross (“My God, my God…,” Matthew 27:46). God does not condemn honest lament; he meets it. You are allowed to be angry, numb, confused, and to bring those feelings to him.\n\nWhere we find hope\n- God is with you in the grief: “The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18). 2 Corinthians 1:3–4 calls God “the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,” who comforts so we can comfort others.\n- Death is not the last word. Because Jesus rose, we have hope beyond death (1 Corinthians 15; John 11:25–26). Paul comforts: we do not grieve as those without hope (1 Thessalonians 4:13–18). Revelation promises a day when God “will wipe away every tear” and there will be no more death (Revelation 21:4).\n- God can bring purpose out of pain without making the pain good. Romans 8:28 affirms that God works for good for those who love him, but it does not say God caused the evil. The certainty is not that you will understand now why this happened, but that God can redeem and use even the worst things in his wider story of restoration.\n\nPractical, pastoral help\n- Give yourself permission to grieve. Don’t let anyone rush you with platitudes. The journey will have waves—shock, anger, numbness, anxiousness, sadness—and that is normal.\n- Talk about the child. Tell stories, look at photos, allow rituals (funeral, memorial, planting a tree) that name the loss. Silence can make grief heavier.\n- Bring your questions to God and to others. Pray honestly; join others who will listen (friends, family, a pastor, a Christian counselor). These questions do not make you less faithful.\n- Get help if you need it. Grief counseling, support groups (GriefShare, church bereavement ministries), and medical help (if you’re struggling with depression or safety) are all appropriate and wise.\n- Stay in Scripture and prayer, but beware of tidy answers. Read Psalms of lament (e.g., Psalm 13, 22, 88), John 11, 1 Thessalonians 4, and passages of comfort (Psalm 23; 2 Corinthians 1:3–4). Let Scripture shape your grief rather than let others’ clichés define it.\n\nA few honest theological lines to hold together\n- God’s love and goodness are not contradictory to your pain. He mourns with you even while he works, ultimately, for redemption.\n- God permits broken things in a world marred by sin; permitting is not the same as approving.\n- God can bring ultimate good (redeeming purposes, comfort, spiritual growth, witness) out of suffering, but that does not mean the suffering was good or that you must be grateful for the loss.\n\nCan I pray with you now?\nGracious Father, we bring this parent's broken heart to you. We do not understand this loss; we only know the ache. Comfort this soul with your nearness; give them your peace that passes understanding. Hold the memory of their child in your hands, and grant the hope of the resurrection into which Jesus has gone before us. Give wisdom and care to those who walk alongside them today. In Jesus’ name, amen.\n\nIf you would like, I’d be honored to meet with you, pray with you, or help connect you to a Christian grief counselor or support group. You don’t have to carry this alone.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response presents a careful, biblically grounded reconciliation of God’s sovereignty, human suffering, and grief. It correctly affirms that God is loving and does not take pleasure in death or suffering, while also acknowledging the fallen, sin-tainted world in which tragedy occurs. It distinguishes between God’s permissive will and decretive will (permitting vs. intentionally willed outcomes), and it correctly notes that God can bring good from evil without endorsing or causing the evil itself (citing Genesis 50:20, Romans 8:28, John 11, etc.). The answer normalizes lament and honest questioning (citing Psalms, Job, Habakkuk) and anchors hope in Scripture (Psalm 34:18; 2 Corinthians 1:3–4; 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18; Revelation 21:4; John 11:25–26). Practical pastoral guidance (grief expression, community support, counseling) and a prayer are appropriate and helpful. The argument remains balanced: suffering is real and not morally good; God can redeem without implying He authored the evil. A minor improvement could be explicit acknowledgment that some aspects of God’s purposes in suffering remain mysterious, but the response already softens certainty about understanding the exact reasons. Overall, the answer aligns well with historic Christian orthodoxy and biblical teaching."
