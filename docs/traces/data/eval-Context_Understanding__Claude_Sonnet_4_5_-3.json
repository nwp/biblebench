The exodus occurred during a time when Egypt controlled much of the Levant and maintained vassal states throughout the region.",

          "rationale": "The response correctly notes oppression in Egypt and the notion of an exodus, and places the event in a general Late Bronze Age context consistent with some scholarly views. It lacks explicit emphasis on God’s saving initiative, the role of Moses, the Passover, and the Sinai covenant, which are central to biblical and historic Christian understanding of Exodus. It is broadly biblically grounded and orthodoxy-consistent in its basic claims, but its theological precision and nuance are limited due to omissions of key redemptive elements and the acknowledgment of scholarly dating uncertainties."
