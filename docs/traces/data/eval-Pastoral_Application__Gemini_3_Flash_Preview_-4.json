    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "My dear friend, thank you for sharing your heart with me. I want you to hear this clearly and deeply: **No, you are not failing spiritually.**\n\nIn fact, the very fact that you are wrestling with this, seeking God in the midst of the fog, and caring about your relationship with Him reveals a heart that is remarkably faithful.\n\nWhen people suggest that depression is simply a \"lack of faith,\" they usually mean well, but they are offering a misguided theology that lacks both biblical breadth and human compassion. Let’s look together at what God’s Word actually says about our struggles, our bodies, and our faith.\n\n### 1. Faith and Suffering are Neighbors\nThe Bible is filled with \"giants of the faith\" who walked through deep darkness. David cried out in the Psalms, *\"My soul is full of troubles... I am like a man who has no strength\"* (Psalm 88:3-4). Elijah, after a great spiritual victory, sat under a tree and prayed that he might die (1 Kings 19). Even Jesus, in the Garden of Gethsemane, said, *\"My soul is very sorrowful, even to death\"* (Matthew 26:38).\n\nIf these men—the prophets, the psalmists, and the Savior Himself—experienced \"dark nights of the soul,\" then we cannot say that depression is a sign of spiritual failure. Often, it is in the darkness that faith is most refined, because you are choosing to hold onto God when you cannot feel Him.\n\n### 2. We are Whole Persons: Body and Spirit\nGod created us as integrated beings—we are both spiritual souls and physical bodies. Because we live in a fallen world, our bodies break. Just as the pancreas can fail to produce insulin (diabetes), the brain can struggle to regulate the chemicals that affect mood and perception (depression). \n\nTaking medication for a chemical imbalance in the brain is no more a \"lack of faith\" than taking an antibiotic for an infection or wearing glasses to see. We use the common grace of medicine to help the body function as God intended it to. Using medication is not a way of bypassing God; it is a way of stewarding the physical body He gave you so that you have the mental clarity to seek Him and serve others.\n\n### 3. Grace is for the Weak\nThe \"just have more faith\" advice often implies that we have to pull ourselves up by our own spiritual bootstraps. But the Gospel is the opposite: it is the news that when we are weak, He is strong (2 Corinthians 12:9). \n\nGod is not a demanding taskmaster waiting for you to \"fix\" your mood before He accepts you. He is the *\"Father of mercies and God of all comfort\"* (2 Corinthians 1:3). He does not despise you for your struggle; He draws near to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18).\n\n### 4. Practical Encouragement\nAs you move forward, I want to offer a few practical thoughts:\n\n*   **Discern the voices:** When people offer \"advice\" that leaves you feeling condemned rather than encouraged, remember Romans 8:1: *\"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.\"* If a teaching makes you feel ashamed of a medical condition, that teaching is not from the Holy Spirit.\n*   **Continue your treatment:** Please continue to work with your doctors and therapists. Stewardship of your mental health is a form of worship.\n*   **Small steps of faith:** On days when \"great faith\" feels impossible, remember that faith the size of a mustard seed is enough. If all you can do today is whisper the name of Jesus or breathe a simple prayer, that is a victory.\n*   **Find a supportive community:** You need brothers and sisters who will \"weep with those who weep\" (Romans 12:15) without trying to \"fix\" you with platitudes.\n\nYou are a child of God, bought with a price, and loved in the darkness just as much as in the light. Your depression does not define your identity; your union with Christ does. \n\nShall we pray together for strength and for the peace that surpasses understanding to guard your heart and mind?",

          "rationale": "The LLM response is largely faithful to biblical teaching and orthodox Christian anthropology. It correctly affirms that depression is not a sign of spiritual failure and that believers can wrestle with deep anguish while remaining faithful. It cites biblical examples (David, Elijah, Jesus) to illustrate that faithful people experience darkness, which supports the claim that depression can accompany faith rather than indicate a lack of faith. It treats humans as integrated beings—body and soul—and endorses medical treatment as stewardship, likening medication to insulin or glasses. It emphasizes grace amid weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9; 2 Corinthians 1:3; Psalm 34:18) and combats the common error of equating faith with medical neglect, while encouraging prayer, community, and professional care (doctors/therapists). It also warns against condemning teachings that shame medical struggles (Romans 8:1) and offers practical steps for pursuing mental health and spiritual support (discernment, community, small faith steps).\n\nNuances present: affirming that God works through both medicine and prayer; recognizing the body-soul unity; acknowledging that not all spiritual experiences are feelings-based; encouraging cautious discernment of unhelpful religious counsel. Minor gaps: the response does not explicitly name specific medications (e.g., Prozac) or discuss the potential range of mental health conditions and therapies in detail, nor does it reference Job's friends by name, though it touches on a similar warning against blaming suffering on sin. Overall, the theological framing remains solid, biblically grounded, and pastorally sensitive."
