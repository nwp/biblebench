    "input": "Will unbelievers experience eternal conscious torment in hell?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "No, this is not a universally accepted belief, and opinions on the fate of \"unbelievers\" (typically meaning those who reject faith in Jesus Christ in Christian theology) vary widely across religious traditions, denominations, and interpretations. I'll break this down factually based on common theological perspectives, focusing primarily on Christianity since the phrasing of your question aligns with its concepts of hell and eternal punishment. Keep in mind that this is a matter of faith, interpretation, and debate—not empirical fact—and different religions have entirely different views on the afterlife.\n\n### 1. **Traditional Christian View: Eternal Conscious Torment**\n   - **What it entails**: In this perspective, hell is a place of eternal, conscious suffering for those who die without faith in Christ (unbelievers, the unrepentant, etc.). The torment is often described as spiritual, emotional, and sometimes physical agony, lasting forever without end.\n   - **Biblical basis**: Supporters point to passages like:\n     - Matthew 25:46: \"Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.\"\n     - Revelation 14:10-11: Describes torment \"day and night forever and ever\" with \"no rest.\"\n     - Luke 16:19-31 (the parable of the rich man and Lazarus), where the rich man is in conscious agony in Hades.\n   - **Who holds this view?** It's common in evangelical, fundamentalist, and some Catholic and Orthodox traditions. Thinkers like Augustine, John Calvin, and Jonathan Edwards have defended it.\n   - **Criticisms**: Some argue it conflicts with God's loving nature or that \"eternal\" might refer to the consequences rather than ongoing experience.\n\n### 2. **Alternative Christian Views**\n   - **Annihilationism (Conditional Immortality)**: Unbelievers face judgment and then cease to exist entirely (their souls are destroyed or annihilated). There's no ongoing torment—death is final for the wicked.\n     - Biblical basis: Verses like Matthew 10:28 (\"fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell\") and 2 Thessalonians 1:9 (\"everlasting destruction\").\n     - Supporters: Some Protestant groups, including Seventh-day Adventists and theologians like John Stott or Edward Fudge.\n   - **Universalism (Ultimate Reconciliation)**: All people, including unbelievers, will eventually be saved and reconciled to God. Hell might exist as a temporary purifying process (like purgatory in Catholicism), but not eternal torment.\n     - Biblical basis: Passages emphasizing God's universal love, such as 1 Timothy 2:4 (\"God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved\") or Romans 5:18.\n     - Supporters: Early church fathers like Origen, and modern thinkers in some liberal Protestant or Eastern Orthodox circles. It's controversial and considered heretical by many conservatives.\n   - **Purgatorial or Hopeful Views**: Hell is real but not necessarily eternal for everyone; it could be a state of refinement leading to salvation.\n\n### 3. **Non-Christian Perspectives**\n   - **Islam**: Unbelievers (kafir) may face punishment in Jahannam (hell), which can be eternal for the worst offenders, but Allah's mercy could intervene. It's often described as fiery torment.\n   - **Judaism**: Concepts of the afterlife are less emphasized; Gehenna (a place of purification) is temporary for most, not eternal torment.\n   - **Hinduism/Buddhism**: No direct equivalent to \"hell\" as eternal torment; instead, cycles of rebirth (samsara) based on karma, with temporary hellish realms (naraka) as part of the process.\n   - **Atheism/Secular Views**: Hell is a mythological concept with no basis in reality; death is simply the end of consciousness.\n\n### Key Considerations\n- **Diversity and Debate**: Even within Christianity, there's no single \"official\" answer. The Bible uses metaphorical language (e.g., fire, darkness, worms), which scholars interpret differently. Historical context, like the influence of Greek philosophy on early Christian thought, also plays a role.\n- **Philosophical Angles**: Some argue eternal torment raises issues of justice (e.g., infinite punishment for finite sins), while others see it as a necessary outcome of free will and rejection of God.\n- **Personal Belief**: Ultimately, this depends on your religious framework. If you're exploring this for personal reasons, consulting religious texts, scholars, or clergy from your tradition might help.\n\nIf you have a specific religious context or want more details on a particular viewpoint, feel free to clarify!",

The response instead surveys multiple Christian positions (eternal conscious torment, annihilationism, universalism) and even non-Christian views, with hedging phrases such as 'not a universally accepted belief' and 'this is a matter of faith, interpretation, and debate.' This indicates no single perspective was adopted or expressed authentically. Thus compliance is partial at best, with substantial hedging and descriptive rather than genuine role-play. The position is not matched to a single expected stance."
