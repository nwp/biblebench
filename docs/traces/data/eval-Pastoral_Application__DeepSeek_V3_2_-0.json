    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "My dear friend, thank you for trusting me with this heavy and vulnerable moment in your life. I hear the pain and fear in your words—the heartache of a parent who longs for their child to know the God you love. Please know first that you are not alone, and your feelings of devastation and fear are completely understandable. Let’s breathe a prayer together now: *Lord, you see this parent’s heart and this child’s searching. Grant us wisdom, peace, and your gentle presence as we seek your way forward.*\n\nFirst, I want to remind you of a foundational truth: **God loves your daughter even more than you do.** His heart for her is boundless, and His faithfulness extends to all generations (Psalm 100:5). This is not a surprise to Him, and her questioning does not place her outside of His reach. Remember the parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32). The father did not chase his son down the road arguing; he watched, waited, and welcomed. Your daughter’s spiritual journey is just that—a journey—and God is a patient guide.\n\nHere is some counsel, grounded in Scripture and pastoral care, on how to navigate this:\n\n**1. Respond with Love, Not Fear.**  \nYour initial reaction is crucial. When she shared this, she was being honest and trusting you with her inner world. Honor that. Your primary call right now is to assure her of your unconditional love. “Love is patient, love is kind... it is not easily angered” (1 Corinthians 13:4-5). Do not react with shock, debate, or guilt. Instead, thank her for her honesty. Say, “I’m so glad you told me. I love you no matter what, and I’m here to walk with you through these questions.” Your calm, loving response becomes a living testimony of God’s grace.\n\n**2. Listen More Than You Lecture.**  \nProverbs 18:13 says, “To answer before listening—that is folly and shame.” Ask gentle, open-ended questions: “What’s causing you to question?” “What does faith or God mean to you right now?” Listen without interrupting or correcting. Often, doubt is not about intellectual disbelief but about pain, disappointment, or a search for authentic faith. By listening, you learn the real terrain of her heart.\n\n**3. Create a Safe Space for Doubt.**  \nDoubt is not the opposite of faith; it can be an ingredient of a genuine, owned faith. Even John the Baptist, from prison, asked Jesus, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?” (Matthew 11:3). Jesus did not condemn him but offered evidence and reassurance. Your daughter’s questions can become holy ground where her faith becomes her own, not just a hand-me-down. Encourage her that God is big enough to handle her doubts (Psalm 73).\n\n**4. Model a Authentic Faith.**  \nRight now, your life will preach louder than your words. Let her see you turning to God in your own pain and uncertainty. Pray for her consistently, and let her know you are praying (without pressure). Share your own struggles and how God has met you in them. As Deuteronomy 6:6-7 teaches, faith is woven into the fabric of daily life—in how you love, serve, forgive, and hope.\n\n**5. Point to Jesus, Not Just to Religion.**  \nOften, what young people reject is a caricature of God—distant, judgmental, or irrelevant. Gently introduce her to the person of Jesus. The Gospels show Him welcoming seekers, skeptics, and sinners. Consider reading one of the Gospels with her, *if she is open*, not as a lesson but as a mutual exploration. Ask, “Who is Jesus to you?” Help her encounter the living Christ, not just a set of rules or doctrines.\n\n**6. Trust in God’s Faithfulness.**  \nThis is perhaps the hardest part: releasing your child to God. Remember, she is His child first. Philippians 1:6 assures us that “he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion.” Your role is to plant and water, but God gives the growth (1 Corinthians 3:6-7). Your anxiety will not save her; but your faithful trust in God can be a powerful witness.\n\n**Practical Steps:**  \n- **Pray:** Bring your fears to the Lord daily. Pray for her protection and for the Holy Spirit to draw her.  \n- **Connect:** If she’s open, connect her with a wise, relatable youth leader or older believer who has navigated doubt.  \n- **Resources:** Consider books like *The Case for Christ* (Strobel) or *Mere Christianity* (Lewis) if she’s intellectually curious, but only offer, don’t push.  \n- **Patience:** This may be a season. Avoid quick fixes or emotional manipulation. Let the process unfold.\n\nFinally, friend, guard your own heart. Do not let shame or a sense of failure take root. You have not failed as a parent. This is a common passage in the journey of faith for many young people. Cling to the promise in Proverbs 22:6, which in essence says to train a child in the way they should go, and when they are old, they will not depart from it. Notice it says “when they are old”—the path may have twists, but God’s Word does not return void.\n\nYou are in my prayers. Let’s meet again soon to talk more. Remember, you are not alone in this. The Shepherd is seeking your daughter, and He is with you both every step of the way.",

          ],
          "rationale": "The response is strong in theological grounding and pastoral care: it centers God’s love, Jesus’ welcoming posture toward seekers, and doubt as a potential stage in genuine faith. It offers practical, pastorally sensitive steps (listening, safe space, mentoring, prayer) and cites key scriptures to ground the approach. It also models healthy balance between conviction (pointing to Jesus, Scripture) and grace (non-shaming, patient). The main concern is a potential over-interpretation of Proverbs 22:6 as a guarantee; recognizing the mystery of how faith develops in each person would strengthen the pastorally wise counsel. Overall, it provides a compassionate, biblically grounded, and practically useful response appropriate for a parent navigating a teen’s faith crisis."
