    "expected": "",
    "output": "### Biblical Foundations and Theological Tensions\n\nThe question of how the church should respond to members in same-sex relationships touches on deep tensions within Christian theology, particularly around human sexuality, sin, grace, and church discipline. Scripture affirms that all humans are created in God's image (Genesis 1:27) and loved by Him (John 3:16), yet it also calls for holiness and repentance from sin (1 Peter 1:15-16; Acts 3:19). Jesus modeled radical welcome to sinners while urging transformation: \"Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more\" (John 8:11). Key biblical texts on same-sex relations include:\n\n- **Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13**: Condemn male same-sex intercourse as an \"abomination\" (to'evah in Hebrew, often denoting ritual or moral impurity).\n- **Romans 1:26-27**: Paul describes same-sex acts as \"contrary to nature\" and shameful, linking them to idolatry and humanity's broader rebellion against God.\n- **1 Corinthians 6:9-11 and 1 Timothy 1:9-10**: Lists \"men who have sex with men\" (arsenokoitai and malakoi in Greek, terms debated but traditionally understood as active and passive homosexual partners) among sins excluding one from God's kingdom—yet Paul adds hope: \"And such were some of you. But you were washed...\" emphasizing transformation through Christ.\n- **Jesus' teachings**: While silent on homosexuality directly, Jesus reaffirms Genesis 2:24 in Matthew 19:4-6, defining marriage as between male and female, and elevates sexual ethics (Matthew 5:27-28).\n\nThese texts form the basis for debate: Are they culturally bound (e.g., addressing exploitative practices like pederasty or temple prostitution), or timeless principles? Traditional interpreters see a consistent biblical prohibition on all sexual activity outside heterosexual marriage. Affirming interpreters argue for a trajectory toward inclusion, citing God's redemptive arc (e.g., Gentiles in Acts 15) and love commands (Matthew 22:37-40).\n\n### Diverse Christian Perspectives and Practices\n\nChristianity's 2.5 billion adherents span a spectrum, with no single \"church\" response. Here's a balanced overview:\n\n#### 1. **Traditional/Non-Affirming View (Majority Global Position)**\n   - Held by Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, most Evangelicals, Pentecostals, and Global South Anglicans (e.g., GAFCON).\n   - **Core conviction**: Sexual activity is reserved for lifelong, monogamous heterosexual marriage (Hebrews 13:4; Genesis 2:24). Same-sex relationships involving sexual intimacy constitute sin, like adultery or fornication.\n   - **Church response**:\n     - **Welcome and membership**: Yes, to individuals experiencing same-sex attraction (SSA), as all bear sinful inclinations (Romans 3:23). Churches like those in the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) or Southern Baptist Convention emphasize pastoral care, celibacy, and support groups (e.g., Living Out or Revoice).\n     - **Leadership**: No for those in active same-sex relationships or unrepentant of related sins (1 Timothy 3:2-7; Titus 1:6 require blameless leaders, often interpreted as sexually faithful in marriage or single/celibate).\n     - **Rationale**: Church discipline protects the flock (1 Corinthians 5:1-5; Matthew 18:15-17) and upholds biblical sexual ethics. Repentance involves pursuing holiness, possibly including celibacy.\n   - **Examples**: The Catholic Catechism (2357-2359) calls homosexual acts \"intrinsically disordered\" but urges respect for persons. The 2023 Global Methodist Church Discipline bars self-avowed practicing homosexuals from ordination.\n\n#### 2. **Affirming/Inclusive View**\n   - Prevalent in mainline Protestants (e.g., Episcopal Church USA, United Church of Christ, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) and some progressive Catholics/Evangelicals.\n   - **Core conviction**: Committed same-sex relationships can reflect God's covenant love, analogous to heterosexual marriage. Biblical condemnations address abuse/power imbalances, not mutual love. Emphasis on fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) and justice (Micah 6:8).\n   - **Church response**:\n     - **Welcome and membership**: Full inclusion, celebrating LGBTQ+ identities as God-given.\n     - **Leadership**: Yes, including married same-sex couples as elders/pastors.\n     - **Rationale**: God's grace covers all (Romans 8:1); exclusion harms the vulnerable (James 2:1-9). Jesus prioritized the marginalized (Luke 15).\n   - **Examples**: The United Methodist Church's 2024 schism saw affirming factions form the United Methodist Church, ordaining gay clergy.\n\n#### 3. **Third-Way or Welcoming but Not Affirming Approaches**\n   - Seen in some Anglican, Lutheran, and independent churches (e.g., Anglican Communion's \"walking together\" via Lambeth 1998/2022 resolutions).\n   - Bless individuals/couples without endorsing sexual activity; focus on hospitality, counseling, and unity (Ephesians 4:2-6). Membership possible with celibacy pledges; leadership case-by-case.\n\n### Pastoral Recommendations for Churches\n\nRegardless of stance, Scripture mandates love (1 Corinthians 13), truth-speaking (Ephesians 4:15), and unity in Christ (John 17:21). Practical steps:\n- **Hospitality first**: \"Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers\" (Hebrews 13:2). Invite all to worship, hear the gospel.\n- **Discernment and process**: Use Matthew 18 for private resolution before discipline. Offer counseling rooted in Scripture (e.g., on identity in Christ, not orientation—Galatians 2:20).\n- **Holistic sexuality teaching**: Address all sins—heterosexual immorality, divorce, greed (1 Corinthians 6:18)—to avoid hypocrisy.\n- **Prayer and humility**: Seek the Spirit's wisdom (James 1:5); recognize our finitude in interpreting texts.\n- **Global context**: In the West, cultural pressures favor affirmation; in Africa/Asia, traditional views dominate (e.g., 2022 Lambeth: 75% bishops upheld traditional marriage).\n\n### Conclusion: Grace and Truth in Tension\n\nThe church should respond with **compassionate firmness**, welcoming repentant sinners (all of us) while upholding biblical standards. Full membership and leadership for those in active same-sex relationships? Traditionalists say no, to honor Scripture's sexual ethic; affirmers say yes, prioritizing inclusion. Both sides appeal to love and fidelity to God, but differ on what constitutes sin.\n\nUltimately, the church's witness hinges on embodying Jesus: grace without compromise (John 1:14). Local congregations must prayerfully decide based on their reading of Scripture, confessional standards, and context—while pursuing ecumenical dialogue. For deeper study, consult *The Bible and Homosexual Practice* (traditional, Robert Gagnon) or *God and the Gay Christian* (affirming, Matthew Vines), alongside primary texts.
