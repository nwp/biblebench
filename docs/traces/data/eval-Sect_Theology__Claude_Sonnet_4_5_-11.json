    "expected": "No, this is the ancient heresy of modalism (also called Sabellianism), which was condemned by the early church. Orthodox Christianity teaches that God is one being eternally existing as three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Biblical evidence for their simultaneous distinct existence includes Jesus' baptism (Matthew 3:16-17) where the Son is baptized, the Spirit descends, and the Father speaks - all at the same time. Jesus prays to the Father (John 17), showing personal relationship between persons. The apostolic blessing (2 Corinthians 13:14) distinguishes three persons. Modalism was rejected because it cannot account for the relationships within the Godhead and makes Jesus' prayers to the Father nonsensical.",
    "output": "# Theological Analysis: Oneness Pentecostalism and Orthodox Trinitarianism\n\n## The Oneness Pentecostal Position\n\nOneness Pentecostalism (also called \"modalism\" or \"Sabellianism\") teaches that:\n- God is absolutely one person\n- \"Father,\" \"Son,\" and \"Holy Spirit\" are modes, manifestations, or roles of the one divine person\n- God reveals Himself sequentially or functionally in different modes\n- Jesus is the name of the one God, and the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him\n\n## Orthodox Christian Teaching\n\nThis view **departs from orthodox Christian doctrine** as defined by all major Christian traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant). Here's why:\n\n### Historic Christian Trinitarianism teaches:\n- **One God in three persons** (not one person in three modes)\n- The three persons are **eternally and simultaneously distinct**\n- Each person is fully God, sharing one divine essence\n- The persons relate to one another (the Father loves the Son, the Son prays to the Father, etc.)\n\n### Key Ecumenical Councils that established this:\n- **Council of Nicaea (325 AD)** - affirmed the Son's full deity and distinction from the Father\n- **Council of Constantinople (381 AD)** - affirmed the Holy Spirit's personhood and deity\n- **Council of Chalcedon (451 AD)** - clarified Christ's two natures\n\n## Biblical Problems with Oneness Theology\n\n1. **Jesus' baptism** (Matthew 3:16-17) - all three persons present simultaneously\n2. **Jesus praying to the Father** - genuine interpersonal relationship, not role-playing\n3. **The Great Commission** (Matthew 28:19) - \"name\" (singular) of Father \"and\" Son \"and\" Holy Spirit (suggesting unity with distinction)\n4. **John 1:1** - \"the Word was with God\" (distinction) \"and the Word was God\" (unity)\n5. **Jesus' statements** like \"I and the Father are one\" (John 10:30) alongside \"the Father is greater than I\" (John 14:28) - suggesting both unity and distinction\n\n## Historical Context\n\nModalism was rejected as heretical in the early church (3rd century) when taught by Sabellius. The church fathers argued it:\n- Makes the incarnation incoherent (did God abandon heaven when becoming man?)\n- Eliminates real relationships within the Godhead\n- Cannot account for simultaneous biblical references to distinct persons\n- Makes Christ's prayers to the Father mere theater\n\n## Areas of Agreement\n\nOneness Pentecostals do affirm with orthodoxy:\n- Monotheism (one God)\n- The full deity of Jesus Christ\n- Salvation through Jesus alone\n- The authority of Scripture\n- The reality of the Holy Spirit's work\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile Oneness Pentecostalism shares significant common ground with historic Christianity, **its doctrine of God constitutes a departure from orthodox Christian teaching** as defined by the ancient creeds and ecumenical councils. The classical Trinitarian position—one God existing eternally as three distinct persons—has been the consistent teaching of the vast majority of Christianity across Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions for nearly 2,000 years.\n\nThis assessment is not meant to question the sincerity or Christian commitment of Oneness believers, but to accurately represent where their theology stands in relation to historic Christian orthodoxy.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately portrays orthodox Trinitarian teaching and the historic critique of Oneness (modalistic) positions. It correctly labels Oneness Pentecostalism as modalism, and it cites key biblical texts (Matt 3:16-17; John 17; Matt 28:19; John 1:1; John 10:30; 2 Cor 13:14) to support the orthodox view of three persons who are eternally and simultaneously distinct in one divine essence. It notes crucial historical markers (Nicaea, Constantinople, Chalcedon) and explains why modalism is deemed inadequate (it cannot account for real, interpersonal relations within the Godhead and for biblical depictions of the Father, Son, and Spirit interacting). It also acknowledges areas of common ground between Oneness and orthodox Christianity (monotheism, deity of Jesus, Spirit’s work) while maintaining that the Oneness view departs from orthodox dogma. The treatment captures essential theological distinctions and uses biblical grounding, with a reasonable (though concise) historical context. Minor enhancements could include a more explicit distinction between ontological vs. economic Trinity and noting that Chalcedon is primarily about Christology (not the Trinity), but these do not materially undermine the overall accuracy.)"
