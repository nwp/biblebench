    "expected": "",
    "output": "The Bible presents a holistic vision of God's concern for justice, equity, and human dignity, deeply integrating these concerns into the core narrative of redemption. Here's a balanced theological engagement with your question:\n\n### 1. **Biblical Foundations for Justice & Equity**\n- **Creation Mandate**: Genesis 1:26-27 establishes human dignity and equality before God. Humanity's role as stewards (Genesis 1:28-30) implies responsibility for just social structures.\n- **Law & Prophets**: The Mosaic Law mandated care for the vulnerable (Deuteronomy 24:19-21; Leviticus 19:33-34). Prophets like Amos (2:6-7; 5:21-24) and Isaiah (1:23-25; 58:6-7) condemned systemic oppression, religious hypocrisy, and economic exploitation as violations of covenant faithfulness.\n- **Jesus' Ministry**: Jesus' inaugural declaration (Luke 4:18-19) links the gospel to liberation for the oppressed. His parables (e.g., Good Samaritan, Luke 10:25-37) redefine neighbor-love as active justice. His confrontations with exploitative systems (e.g., temple merchants, John 2:13-16) show God's concern for economic fairness.\n- **Apostolic Witness**: The early church practiced radical equity (Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-35). Paul emphasized unity in Christ transcending social divisions (Galatians 3:28; Colossians 3:11) and instructed wealthy churches to care for the poor (2 Corinthians 8-9; James 2:15-16).\n\n### 2. **Systemic Racism & Inequality: Gospel Issues?**\n- **Sin's Corrupted Systems**: The Fall (Genesis 3) introduced brokenness into human systems. Racism, caste systems, and economic inequality reflect humanity's rebellion against God's creational order (Romans 1:18-32). Scripture condemns partiality (James 2:1-9) and exploitative labor (Malachi 3:5; Jeremiah 22:13).\n- **God's Heart for the Oppressed**: Over 2,000 biblical passages reference God's concern for the marginalized (e.g., Exodus 3:7-9; Psalm 146:7-9). Justice is central to God's character (Micah 6:8; Isaiah 61:1-3).\n- **Reconciliation as Gospel Core**: The cross reconciles all things to God (Colossians 1:20), breaking down dividing walls (Ephesians 2:14-16). Systemic injustice opposes God's redemptive plan and hinders witness (1 Corinthians 9:19-23).\n\n### 3. **Evangelism vs. Social Justice: A False Dichotomy**\n- **Harmony in Scripture**: Jesus' Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) and Great Commandment (Matthew 22:37-40) are inseparable. Love for God compels love for neighbor (1 John 4:19-21). James 2:17 insists faith without works is dead.\n- **Historical Tensions**:\n  - **Social Gospel Movement (19th-20th C.)**: Emphasized societal reform but sometimes downplayed evangelism.\n  - **Neo-Evangelical Critique**: Argued social action could eclipse the \"pure gospel.\" Carl Henry and others later affirmed a \"comprehensive grace\" addressing both soul and society.\n  - **Liberation Theology**: Highlighted God's preferential option for the poor but faced critiques for Marxist influences.\n- **Modern Consensus**: Most traditions now affirm **integral mission**: evangelism and social justice are distinct but inseparable dimensions of God's work. As the Lausanne Committee states: \"Love of God and neighbor cannot be separated.\"\n\n### 4. **Practical Considerations for the Church**\n- **Discernment**: Not all social causes align with biblical justice (e.g., ideologies contradicting Scripture). The church must engage culture biblically (1 Corinthians 5:9-13; Romans 12:2).\n- **Priorities**: While evangelism remains central (1 Corinthians 9:23), neglecting injustice contradicts the gospel. As Tim Keller notes: \"If we only preach the gospel without doing justice, we misunderstand the gospel.\"\n- **Unity in Diversity**: Christians may differ on policy solutions (e.g., welfare models, reparations). Charity requires wisdom (2 Corinthians 8:21) and grace (Romans 14:1-13).\n\n### Conclusion\nSocial justice, systemic racism, and economic inequality **are deeply embedded in the biblical narrative** and thus core gospel issues. They are not distractions but **essential expressions of the gospel's transformative power**. The gospel calls for both the salvation of souls and the healing of societies, anticipating the final restoration of all creation (Revelation 21:1-4). A reductionist view that isolates evangelism from justice risks betraying the Bible’s holistic vision of redemption. As theologian John Stott argued: \"The gospel is a two-act drama: God reconciles us to himself, and he commissions us to be his ambassadors of reconciliation.\" Both acts are non-negotiable.",
