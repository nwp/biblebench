    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "My dear friend,\n\nThank you for trusting me with this vulnerable and deeply personal question. Your honesty is a sign of spiritual courage, and your desire to know God's heart in the midst of this struggle is evidence of His grace already at work within you. Please hear my heart as I respond: you are seen, you are valued, and you are not alone.\n\nFirst and most importantly: **No, God does not hate you.** The Bible declares the opposite: \"But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us\" (Romans 5:8). God's love is not conditional on our feelings, our purity, or our perfect obedience. It is rooted in His own character (1 John 4:8). The very fact that you are wrestling with these questions suggests the Holy Spirit is at work in you, drawing you toward truth and relationship.\n\nNow, to your core question: **Can you be a Christian and experience these feelings?**\n\nYes, absolutely. Being a Christian is not defined by the absence of temptation or unwanted feelings, but by faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. All Christians—without exception—experience a tension between our fallen human nature (with its disordered desires) and the new life we have in Christ. Your specific struggle with same-sex attraction is one form this tension can take, just as others wrestle with pride, greed, heterosexual lust, anger, or envy. **Temptation itself is not sin.** Even our Lord Jesus \"has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin\" (Hebrews 4:15).\n\nThe biblical narrative is clear that God's design for human sexuality is expressed in the lifelong, covenantal union of one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6). This means that same-sex sexual acts are understood as outside of God's creative intent (e.g., Romans 1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11). However, the Bible draws a crucial distinction between *inclination* and *action*, between *temptation* and *sinful choice*. Your feelings, in themselves, are a part of the complex human experience in a fallen world. It is what you *do* with those feelings—how you steward them—that becomes a matter of discipleship.\n\nHere is where we must hold both **truth** and **grace** together:\n\n*   **In grace:** You are fully welcomed into God's family through faith in Christ. Your identity is not \"homosexual\" or \"struggler,\" but \"beloved child of God,\" \"saint,\" \"redeemed.\" Your feelings do not separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:35-39). You can come to Him exactly as you are.\n\n*   **In truth:** The call of discipleship for every Christian is to take up our cross and follow Jesus (Luke 9:23). This involves a lifelong process of sanctification—having our minds, hearts, and yes, even our desires, gradually transformed to align with God's will (Romans 12:1-2). For you, this will mean pursuing a path of chastity, committing to celibacy if you are not called to a biblical marriage. This is a costly calling, but not a joyless one, for it follows the pattern of Christ who surrendered His will for the greater joy set before Him (Hebrews 12:2).\n\n**Practical Steps for the Journey:**\n\n1.  **Root Yourself in Christ:** Build your primary identity on Him. Immerse yourself in Scripture, prayer, and worship. \"Abide in me, and I in you\" (John 15:4).\n2.  **Seek Authentic Christian Community:** You cannot walk this path alone. Find a safe, biblically grounded church where you can be known, loved, and supported. We are called to bear one another's burdens (Galatians 6:2).\n3.  **Consider Wise Counsel:** Seek out mature, compassionate spiritual mentors or a trusted pastor who can walk with you. There are also tested, gospel-centered ministries that offer support for believers navigating same-sex attraction.\n4.  **Remember the Gospel Daily:** You will have days of victory and days of deep struggle. On every day, run back to the gospel. Your standing before God rests on Christ's finished work, not on your moral performance. Repentance is a daily posture for all believers.\n\nFriend, your struggle does not put you in a special category of \"lesser\" Christian. It simply places you on the same road as every other follower of Jesus—the road of dependence, of grace, of slow transformation. You are not hated. You are so loved that Christ died for you. And you are called—not to a life defined by your feelings, but to a life defined by His love and His lordship.\n\nI am here to pray with you, to study Scripture with you, and to support you as a brother/sister in Christ on this journey. Let us move forward in hope, for \"he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus\" (Philippians 1:6).\n\nIn Christ's love,\n\nPastor",

It correctly asserts that God does not hate the person (Romans 5:8; Romans 8:35-39), and it distinguishes temptation (desire) from sin, consistent with Hebrews 4:15 and James 1. It affirms biblical anthropology and the traditional view that marriage is between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11), while maintaining a compassionate stance toward those who experience same-sex attraction. The response emphasizes grace and inclusion in God’s family, along with the call to discipleship, sanctification, and cross-bearing (Luke 9:23; Romans 12:1-2). It also offers practical steps (community, counsel, gospel-centering life) consistent with pastoral care. Nuance is present in distinguishing inclination from action, and in recognizing varied pastoral paths (celibacy vs. different interpretive positions on sexuality) within orthodox boundaries. Minor stylistic or pastoral nuances (e.g., the language of “disordered desires”) reflect common theological terminology but could be handled with extra sensitivity in conversation. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."

It grounds its counsel in Scripture (John 15:4; Hebrews 12:2; Romans 12:1-2; Luke 9:23) and offers practical steps: grounding in Christ, authentic community, wise counsel, and daily Gospel renewal. It maintains a hopeful, non-hate tone and stresses belonging in Christ and the church. Areas for growth involve acknowledging the wider spectrum of Christian interpretation on sexuality, reducing potential stigma around attraction, and incorporating broader pastoral care resources (including mental-health considerations and diverse pastoral models) to support individuals with SSA in various Christian contexts."
