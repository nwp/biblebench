    "output": "### Biblical Teaching on Sex Before Marriage\n\nThe Bible consistently presents sexual intimacy as a gift from God designed exclusively for the covenantal context of marriage between one man and one woman. Premarital sexual activity—often translated from the Greek *porneia* (sexual immorality, including fornication)—is explicitly prohibited across both Testaments. This teaching is rooted in God's holistic vision for human sexuality, emphasizing purity, self-control, and the sanctity of marriage as a reflection of Christ's relationship with the Church (Ephesians 5:25-33).\n\n#### Key Biblical Texts\n1. **Old Testament Foundations**:\n   - The Seventh Commandment forbids adultery (Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18), but broader laws address premarital sex. For instance, Deuteronomy 22:13-29 prescribes penalties for fornication, treating it as a violation of virginity and family honor, underscoring sex's role in forming a lifelong bond (cf. Genesis 2:24: \"Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh\").\n   - Proverbs warns against sexual temptation, portraying it as a path to personal ruin (Proverbs 5:15-23; 6:20-35; 7:6-27).\n\n2. **New Testament Clarity**:\n   - **1 Corinthians 6:9-20**: Paul lists *porneia* among sins excluding one from God's kingdom, urging believers to \"flee from sexual immorality.\" He argues the body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, and sexual union unites one with another (v. 16-17), even outside marriage—a profound \"one flesh\" reality meant for marital fidelity.\n   - **1 Thessalonians 4:3-8**: \"For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor.\" Violating this transgresses not just human boundaries but God Himself.\n   - **Hebrews 13:4**: \"Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.\"\n   - Jesus affirms marriage's exclusivity (Matthew 19:4-6; Mark 10:6-9) and equates lustful thoughts with adultery (Matthew 5:27-28), elevating internal purity.\n\nThe Greek *porneia* (from which \"fornication\" derives) encompasses all sexual activity outside marriage, including premarital sex, adultery, incest, and prostitution (e.g., Acts 15:20; Galatians 5:19). No biblical text endorses or permits consensual sex before marriage.\n\n#### Cohabitation and Premarital Sexual Activity\n- **Premarital Sex**: Unequivocally unacceptable for Christians. It contradicts God's design, risks emotional/spiritual harm (e.g., 1 Corinthians 6:18: \"Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body\"), and undermines marriage's covenantal nature.\n- **Cohabitation (Living Together Before Marriage)**: The Bible does not directly address modern \"trial marriages,\" but it implies opposition. Cohabitation often involves sexual activity (or temptation thereto), which violates the above texts. Ruth and Boaz's story (Ruth 3) models chaste courtship under family oversight, not shared living. Jesus and Paul praise celibacy or marital fidelity, not cohabitation (1 Corinthians 7:1-9, 25-40). Even non-sexual cohabitation can blur boundaries, fostering rationalization of sin (e.g., \"testing compatibility\").\n\n#### Christian Perspectives\nChristian views are not monolithic, reflecting interpretive differences:\n\n- **Traditional/Evangelical/Conservative (Majority View)**: Groups like Roman Catholics, Orthodox, and most Protestants (e.g., Southern Baptists, Assemblies of God) uphold a strict \"no\" based on literal readings of Scripture. Documents like the Catholic Catechism (CCC 2353) and the Lausanne Covenant affirm chastity until marriage. Studies (e.g., from the Institute for Family Studies) show cohabiting couples face higher divorce risks post-marriage, aligning with biblical warnings.\n\n- **Progressive/Mainline Liberal**: Some denominations (e.g., certain Episcopal or United Church of Christ branches) emphasize love, justice, and cultural context, arguing *porneia* targeted exploitative practices (e.g., temple prostitution) rather than mutual relationships. They may view committed cohabitation as valid if it mirrors covenantal intent, prioritizing Galatians 5:22-23 (fruit of the Spirit) over \"legalism.\" However, this is a minority position, often critiqued for eisegesis (reading modern values into ancient texts).\n\n- **Balanced/Reformed View**: Thinkers like John Piper or Tim Keller stress grace alongside law—sin is forgiven through Christ (1 John 1:9), but repentance means pursuing holiness (Hebrews 12:14). Cultural shifts (e.g., no-fault divorce) don't nullify Scripture; instead, Christians model God's design amid a \"sex-saturated\" world (Romans 12:2).\n\nEmpirical data supports caution: CDC and Barna research indicate premarital sex correlates with higher STD rates, depression, and relational instability, echoing Proverbs' wisdom.\n\n#### Practical Implications and Hope\nChristians are called to chastity (singles) or fidelity (married), supported by community accountability (e.g., Titus 2:3-5), fleeing temptation (2 Timothy 2:22), and the Spirit's power (Galatians 5:16). Past failures don't disqualify; God's forgiveness restores (Psalm 51). In a culture normalizing \"hookup\" culture, believers witness by honoring marriage (Hebrews 13:4).\n\nUltimately, the Bible teaches sex before marriage dishonors God's good gift, but His grace redeems. As theologian Stanley Hauerwas notes, Christian sexual ethics aren't rules but a narrative of shalom—flourishing in God's order. For deeper study, consult resources like *The Meaning of Marriage* (Keller) or *Remarriage after Divorce in Today's Church* (Adams) for nuanced applications.",

It describes premarital sex as disallowed across the testaments and states that no biblical text endorses premarital sex. It cites Old and New Testament passages to support the reading. It also acknowledges disagreement by outlining progressive liberal and balanced reform perspectives and notes these are minority or nuanced positions. It presents alternative views with brief summaries, though the emphasis remains conservative. The tone is predominantly dogmatic in its core claims, but it includes humility by mentioning forgiveness and grace and by urging thoughtful engagement with culture, and it offers resources for deeper study."
