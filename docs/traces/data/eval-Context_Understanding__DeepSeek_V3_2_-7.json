    "expected": "Jesus used parables to reveal truth to those with receptive hearts while concealing it from those who rejected him, and to make spiritual truths memorable through everyday stories",
    "output": "**Clear Answer:**  \nAccording to the Bible, Jesus used parables both **to reveal truth to receptive hearers** and **to conceal truth from those who were spiritually resistant**. This dual purpose is explicitly explained by Jesus himself in the Gospels.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Information and Essential Facts**\n\n1. **The Primary Biblical Explanation**  \n   In **Matthew 13:10–17**, Mark 4:10–12, and Luke 8:9–10, Jesus’ disciples ask why he teaches in parables. Jesus answers that the “secrets of the kingdom of heaven” have been given to them (the disciples and other receptive followers) but **not to those who are “outside”** (quoting Isaiah 6:9–10).  \n   - **To those with open hearts and ears**, parables illustrate spiritual truths in a memorable way.  \n   - **To those whose hearts are hardened or who listen with hostile intent**, parables conceal meaning, preventing them from fully understanding and repenting.\n\n2. **The Nature of Parables**  \n   - Parables are simple, everyday stories (about farming, weddings, money, etc.) that illustrate deeper spiritual or moral lessons.  \n   - They engage listeners, prompt reflection, and often contain a surprising twist that challenges assumptions.\n\n3. **Practical Teaching Benefits**  \n   Beyond the theological explanation of concealment, parables also:  \n   - Make abstract spiritual concepts (e.g., the Kingdom of God) concrete and relatable.  \n   - Are memorable and easy to retell, aiding oral transmission of Jesus’ teaching.  \n   - Invite listeners to think for themselves and discover truth, rather than just receiving dogma.\n\n4. **Progressive Revelation and Judgment**  \n   Scholars note that parables **separate sincere seekers from casual or hostile listeners**. Those who are drawn to Jesus will seek further explanation (as the disciples did), while those who reject him will hear only a story without spiritual insight. Thus, parables both **reveal and conceal** based on the hearer’s spiritual disposition.\n\n---\n\n### **Note on Scholarly Perspectives**\n\n- **Traditional View:** Accepts the Gospel explanation as Jesus’ own intent—parables both reveal and conceal as an act of divine sovereignty and judgment.  \n- **Some Critical Scholars** suggest the “concealment” saying in Mark 4:10–12 may reflect early Christian reflection on why some Jews did not accept Jesus, rather than Jesus’ original intent. However, even in this view, the **didactic and provocative nature** of parables is widely acknowledged.  \n\nIn summary, Jesus used parables **to engage and enlighten receptive followers while veiling truth from those who had already rejected his message**, fulfilling a pattern of prophetic ministry described in Isaiah.",

          "rationale": "The answer correctly cites the biblical basis (Matthew 13; Mark 4; Luke 8) for Jesus' use of parables to reveal truth to insiders and conceal it from outsiders, and it notes the parables' function as memorable, relatable teaching tools. It covers the nature of parables, practical benefits, and a scholarly discussion about progressive revelation and the debated extent of intentional concealment. The response appropriately frames controversial points (e.g., the ‘concealment’ motive) as scholarly debate rather than settled fact, mentioning both traditional and critical viewpoints. Minor caveats (e.g., exact wording in Isaiah 6:9–10 and the interpretation that concealment is a matter of hearer disposition) are acknowledged, which preserves accuracy without overstating certainty."
