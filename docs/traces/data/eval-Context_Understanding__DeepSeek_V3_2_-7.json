            "Misses the nuanced purpose of parables as a means of gradual revelation and fulfillment of prophecy (seeing/hearing yet not understanding) rather than merely concealing from the unreceptive.",
            "Assumes a fixed audience dichotomy instead of the dynamic, heart-condition-based reception described in Scripture.",
            "Does not explicitly ground the claim in specific biblical passages (e.g., Matthew 13:10-17; Mark 4:11-12; Luke 8:9-10)."

          "rationale": "The answer captures the core idea that parables involve revealing truth to the receptive while concealing from the unreceptive, which aligns with biblical teaching. However, it is overly terse and lacks several important nuances: the use of everyday imagery in parables, the gradual and Spirit-enabled understanding they foster, the fulfillment/prophetic dimension, and precise biblical grounding. including those nuances would yield a more robust and historically grounded evaluation."
