    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",

          "rationale": "Overall, the LLM’s answer is solid and aligns well with historic Christian teaching. Key points are accurate and well supported by Scripture and early Christian witness:\n\nWhat the LLM gets right\n- Matthew 28:19 is presented as Jesus’ direct command to baptize into the Triune God (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). This reflects the orthodox reading that the one name (singular) stands for the Triune God with personal distinctions, not a denial of the Trinity.\n- Acts 2:38, 8:16, 10:48, and 19:5 are accurately cited as passages where baptism occurs in the name of Jesus. The interpretation that this often signals authority, identification with Christ, or baptism into Christ’s lordship (distinct from John’s baptism) is a widely held understanding in biblical scholarship.\n- The Didache and other early sources later confirm a Triune baptismal formula (e.g., in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit), illustrating that the triune formula was standard practice early in Christian history. This supports the orthodox position that Trinitarian baptism is normative.\n- The response rightly identifies Oneness teaching as modalistic (often labeled modalistic monarchianism) and notes that this view was rejected by the early Church, which helps readers understand why Orthodox Christianity rejects the “Jesus only” formula as inconsistent with historic doctrine.\n- The conclusion emphasizes that what matters in baptism is truly the form of baptism into the Triune God and the substance of faith, not a rigid insistence on a particular liturgical wording. This mirrors long-standing Christian emphasis on doctrine over rote formula in a way that avoids unnecessary division.\n\nWhat could be more nuanced or clarified (minor caveats)\n- While the Didache and early sources support a Triune formula, Acts contains multiple examples where baptism is described with the phrase “in the name of Jesus.” The LLM’s judgment that Acts primarily signals authority/identification rather than quoting a liturgical formula is defensible, but scholars debate whether or how often Acts reflects a liturgical formula in practice. Acknowledging this scholarly nuance would balance the claim slightly more.\n- The statement that Acts “never claims to quote the formula used” is broadly true, but a careful reader should note that the overall trajectory in early Christian writings supports Triune baptism as standard, and the on-the-ground practice appears to have moved toward or accommodated the Trinitarian formula in many communities (as seen in Didache and other early testimonies).\n- The comparison table is useful for contrast, but it should be understood as a schematic summary rather than an exhaustive historical-categorical account. There were diverse early practices and debates before a more uniform orthodoxy was codified later.\n\nOverall assessment\n- The response is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded in clear, mainstream Christian exegesis.\n- It captures important theological distinctions (Trinitarian orthodoxy vs. Oneness/modalistic positions) and accurately situates the Oneness view within historic controversies.\n- It presents a respectfully critical assessment: Oneness teaching is shown to rest on a interpretive approach that diverges from the plain sense of Matt. 28:19 and from the consensus of early Christian practice, while affirming the value of sincere devotion.\n- Given these strengths, a score of 0.85 is appropriate: largely accurate, well-grounded, and nuanced, with minor room for acknowledging slightly more complexity in Acts’ phrasing and early-liturgy variation."
