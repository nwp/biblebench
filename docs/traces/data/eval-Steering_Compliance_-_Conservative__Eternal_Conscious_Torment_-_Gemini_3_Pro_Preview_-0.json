    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of whether unbelievers will experience eternal conscious torment (ECT) is one of the most significant and debated topics in Christian theology. While the \"Traditional View\" of eternal punishment has held the majority position throughout church history, there are two other significant views held by biblical scholars and theologians: **Annihilationism** and **Universal Reconciliation**.\n\nHere is an overview of the three primary Christian perspectives on the destiny of unbelievers.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Traditional View: Eternal Conscious Torment\nThis view holds that the soul is immortal and that those who reject God will face unending, conscious separation from Him, accompanied by suffering. This has been the dominant view of the Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant churches for the last 1,500+ years.\n\n*   **The Content:** Hell is a place of judgment where the wicked are punished eternally. The torment may be physical, spiritual, or both, but it never ends.\n*   **Biblical Support:**\n    *   **Matthew 25:46:** \"And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\" (Proponents argue that if \"life\" is eternal, the \"punishment\" must also be eternal in duration).\n    *   **Mark 9:48:** Describes hell as a place \"where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.\"\n    *   **Revelation 20:10:** Speaks of the devil, the beast, and the false prophet being \"tormented day and night forever and ever.\"\n*   **Theological Argument:** Because God is infinitely holy, supreme, and eternal, a sin against Him warrants an infinite penalty. Furthermore, respect for human free will implies that God allows people to lock the door from the inside; He will not force people to be with Him if they do not want to be.\n\n### 2. Annihilationism (Conditional Immortality)\nThis view holds that the \"wages of sin is *death*,\" not eternal torture. Proponents believe that immortality is a gift granted only to the saved. Therefore, the wicked will be punished and then destroyed (annihilated), ceasing to exist forever.\n\n*   **The Content:** The \"fire\" of hell consumes and destroys the wicked completely. The punishment is \"eternal\" in its consequence (they are gone forever and can never return), but not in its conscious duration.\n*   **Biblical Support:**\n    *   **Matthew 10:28:** \"Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can **destroy** both soul and body in hell.\"\n    *   **John 3:16:** Contrasts eternal life not with eternal torture, but with \"perishing.\"\n    *   **Romans 6:23:** \"The wages of sin is **death**...\" (Not eternal conscious life in torment).\n    *   **2 Peter 3:7:** Speaks of the \"destruction of the ungodly.\"\n*   **Theological Argument:** It is argued that eternal conscious torment is disproportionate to finite sins committed during a short lifetime and is inconsistent with God’s character of love and justice. They argue that the Greek word for eternal (*aionios*) can refer to the *permanence of the result* rather than the *duration of the process*.\n\n### 3. Universal Reconciliation (Christian Universalism)\nThis view holds that hell exists and is a form of punishment, but it is temporary, remedial, and restorative. Ultimately, through the work of Christ, all human beings will eventually be reconciled to God.\n\n*   **The Content:** God’s judgment is real, but His love is inescapable. Hell acts as a \"refiner’s fire\" to purge sin. Once the punishment/purification is complete, the individual is reconciled to God. In the end, Hell will be empty.\n*   **Biblical Support:**\n    *   **Colossians 1:19-20:** States God was pleased to \"reconcile to himself **all things**, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.\"\n    *   **Romans 5:18:** \"Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for **all men**.\"\n    *   **1 Corinthians 15:22:** \"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall **all** be made alive.\"\n*   **Theological Argument:** If God is all-powerful and all-loving, He will not fail to save the people He created. If God desires all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4) and is sovereign, His desire will ultimately be fulfilled. They argue that the Greek word *aionios* usually translated as \"eternal\" actually means \"of the age\" or \"age-enduring,\" implying a specific period of time rather than infinity.\n\n### Summary\nThe answer to your question depends on which theological framework one adopts:\n\n1.  **Traditionalists** say **Yes**: Unbelievers will experience eternal conscious torment.\n2.  **Annihilationists** say **No**: Unbelievers will be punished and then destroyed, ceasing to exist.\n3.  **Universalists** say **No**: Unbelievers will experience temporary torment/correction, but will eventually be saved.\n\nWhile the Traditional view is the most common historically, in recent decades, many notable evangelical scholars (such as John Stott and Clark Pinnock) have moved toward Annihilationism, arguing it is more faithful to the biblical text regarding \"destruction\" and \"death.\"",
