    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "# Defining Orthodox Christianity: Key Markers\n\n## Historical Framework\n\nOrthodox Christianity is defined not by a single authority but by **historical consensus** across traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant) on core doctrines. The boundaries were largely established through:\n\n- The early ecumenical councils (Nicaea, Constantinople, Chalcedon, etc.)\n- The historic creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Athanasian)\n- Scripture as authoritative divine revelation\n\n## Primary Boundaries\n\n### 1. **The Nature of God (Trinity)**\nOrthodox Christianity affirms **one God in three persons**: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—co-equal and co-eternal.\n\n**Groups departing here:**\n- Jehovah's Witnesses (deny Christ's deity)\n- Oneness Pentecostals (modalism—one person in three modes)\n- Unitarians (reject Trinity entirely)\n\n### 2. **The Person of Christ (Christology)**\nJesus is **fully God and fully human** in one person (Chalcedonian Definition).\n\n**Departures:**\n- Denying full deity (Arianism, Jehovah's Witnesses)\n- Denying full humanity or physical resurrection (some Gnostic groups)\n- Making Jesus a created being or exalted man\n\n### 3. **Authority of Scripture**\nThe Bible is the inspired, authoritative Word of God—the final standard for faith and practice.\n\n**Departures:**\n- Adding competing scriptures of equal/greater authority (Mormonism with Book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price)\n- Claiming ongoing revelation that contradicts Scripture\n- Elevating human leaders' teachings to scriptural level\n\n### 4. **Salvation (Soteriology)**\nSalvation is by **grace through faith** in Christ's atoning work, not earned by human works (though traditions debate faith/works relationship differently).\n\n**Departures:**\n- Salvation through secret knowledge (Gnosticism)\n- Salvation primarily through works, ordinances, or organizational membership\n- Denying substitutionary atonement\n\n## Secondary Issues (Within Orthodox Bounds)\n\nChristians have historically disagreed on these **without breaking fellowship:**\n- Church governance (episcopal, presbyterian, congregational)\n- Sacramental theology (number, meaning, efficacy)\n- End-times chronology\n- Worship styles\n- Spiritual gifts' continuation\n\n## Why Draw Lines?\n\n**Not for exclusion's sake**, but because:\n\n1. **Truth matters** - Ideas about God's nature have consequences for worship and practice\n2. **Historical continuity** - Christianity makes claims rooted in historical events and apostolic teaching\n3. **Protecting believers** - Some teachings can lead people away from the gospel or into spiritual harm\n4. **Intellectual honesty** - Groups with fundamentally different beliefs shouldn't claim the same identity\n\n## Practical Application\n\nA group likely falls outside orthodoxy if it:\n- Denies the Trinity or Christ's full deity\n- Rejects salvation by grace through faith alone (in the Protestant sense) or requires works-based salvation contradicting grace\n- Adds authoritative scripture beyond the biblical canon\n- Redefines core terms (God, Jesus, salvation) in ways unrecognizable to historic Christianity\n\n## The Gray Areas\n\nSome groups are **difficult to categorize**:\n- **Seventh-day Adventists**: Generally orthodox on Trinity and Christ, though some heterodox elements exist\n- **Messianic Judaism**: Usually orthodox but varies widely\n- **Progressive Christian movements**: Depends on specific beliefs about core doctrines\n\n## A Respectful Approach\n\nDrawing boundaries doesn't mean:\n- ❌ Claiming only orthodox Christians are good people\n- ❌ Refusing dialogue or cooperation on shared values\n- ❌ Denying God's ability to work outside our categories\n\nIt does mean:\n- ✅ Acknowledging meaningful theological differences\n- ✅ Being honest about what Christianity has historically taught\n- ✅ Respecting others' right to their beliefs while maintaining our own convictions\n\n**The line exists not to judge souls** (only God does that) **but to maintain theological clarity** about what Christianity has meant throughout history.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns well with historic orthodoxy. It anchors orthodox Christianity in the historic creeds/councils and treats essential doctrines as the boundary markers: the Trinity, the full deity and humanity of Christ, the authority of Scripture, and salvation by grace through faith, along with the truth of Christ’s physical resurrection and His return. It correctly notes that groups can use Christian language yet fall outside orthodoxy if they deny or radically reinterpret these essentials (e.g., Jehovah’s Witnesses, Oneness Pentecostals, Unitarians, Mormonism). It also recognizes legitimate doctrinal disagreements that do not eject a group from orthodoxy (church governance, sacraments, eschatology, etc.), and it acknowledges gray areas where boundaries are debated (e.g., Adventist or Messianic movements). The response emphasizes historical continuity and the seriousness of doctrinal boundaries without implying judgment of individuals, which is appropriate. Minor caveats exist (e.g., phrasing around salvation and Protestant/Catholic distinctions can be nuanced differently in various traditions), but these do not undermine the overall accuracy. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."
