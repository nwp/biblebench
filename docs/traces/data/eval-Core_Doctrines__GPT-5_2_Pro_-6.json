    "expected": "The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became human, lived a perfect life, died on the cross as a substitute for sinners, rose from the dead, and now offers salvation and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe in him. It proclaims that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, not earned by human effort, received through faith in Christ alone.",
    "output": "## The meaning of “gospel”\n“Gospel” (Greek *euangelion*) means **good news**. In the Bible it is the announcement of what **God has done in Jesus Christ**—through his life, death, resurrection, and reign—to save sinners and inaugurate God’s kingdom.\n\n## The gospel in its simplest biblical summary\nPaul gives a classic summary:\n\n> “I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that **Christ died for our sins** in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was **buried**, that he was **raised on the third day** in accordance with the Scriptures…” (1 Corinthians 15:3–4)\n\nSo the gospel is not primarily advice about what we must do; it is **news about what Christ has done**, with a summons to respond.\n\n## The gospel in a fuller biblical outline\n### 1) The gospel is about God and his kingdom\nJesus’ own preaching frames the gospel as the arrival of God’s saving reign:\n\n> “The time is fulfilled, and **the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel**.” (Mark 1:15)\n\nThe gospel announces that in Jesus, God’s promised kingdom has come and will be consummated at Christ’s return (Acts 17:30–31).\n\n### 2) The problem the gospel addresses: sin and judgment\nHumanity is created for God but is fallen—guilty and corrupted by sin (Genesis 3; Romans 3:9–20). The bad news is that we cannot justify or heal ourselves before a holy God (Romans 3:19–20; Ephesians 2:1–3).\n\n### 3) The center of the gospel: the person and work of Christ\nThe good news is that God has acted in his Son:\n\n- **Jesus is the promised Messiah and Son of God** (Romans 1:1–4).\n- **He lived in perfect obedience** (Hebrews 4:15), fulfilling God’s righteousness where we failed.\n- **He died “for our sins”**—a substitutionary, atoning death that deals with guilt and judgment (Isaiah 53; Mark 10:45; Romans 3:24–26; 2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Peter 2:24).\n- **He rose bodily** (1 Corinthians 15:4, 17), vindicating his claims and inaugurating new creation life.\n- **He is exalted as Lord** (Acts 2:32–36), and he will return to judge and renew all things (Acts 17:31; Revelation 21).\n\nIn short: **God saves by grace through the crucified and risen Christ, now reigning as Lord.**\n\n### 4) The gift the gospel gives: justification and reconciliation\nWhen the gospel is believed, God:\n- **Justifies** the ungodly (declares righteous) through faith in Christ, apart from works (Romans 3:28; 4:5).\n- **Forgives sins** (Acts 10:43).\n- **Reconciles** sinners to himself (2 Corinthians 5:18–21).\n- **Adopts** believers as children (Galatians 4:4–7).\n- **Gives the Holy Spirit** who renews and empowers new obedience (Titus 3:4–7; Romans 8:1–4).\n\nThese are **benefits of the gospel**, flowing from Christ’s finished work.\n\n### 5) The required response: repentance and faith\nThe gospel comes with a call:\n\n> “Repent… and be baptized… for the forgiveness of your sins.” (Acts 2:38)  \n> “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.” (Acts 16:31)\n\nWe do not earn salvation; we **receive** Christ and his benefits by turning from sin and trusting him (Ephesians 2:8–9).\n\n## What the gospel is *not*\n- Not moral self-improvement (“try harder”)—it is **news of Christ’s saving work** (Romans 5:6–8).\n- Not a promise of earthly prosperity—its center is **forgiveness, reconciliation, and new creation life** through the cross and resurrection (Luke 9:23; 1 Peter 1:3–5).\n- Not merely “God loves you” detached from the cross—God’s love is **shown and accomplished** in Christ’s atoning death and victorious resurrection (Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:1–4).\n\n## One-sentence definition\n**The gospel is the good news that the triune God has fulfilled his promises by sending his Son, Jesus Christ, who died for our sins and rose again as Lord, so that all who repent and believe are forgiven, justified, reconciled to God, and brought into his kingdom.**",

          "rationale": "The LLM response presents a comprehensive and biblically faithful account of the gospel. It identifies the core content (Jesus’ life, death as substitutionary atonement, resurrection, lordship, and kingdom) and the appropriate human response (repentance and faith). It correctly emphasizes grace (not earned by works), justification by faith, reconciliation, adoption, and the indwelling Spirit, all supported by key scriptures (e.g., 1 Cor 15:3–4; Rom 3:28; Eph 2:8–9; Isa 53; Acts 2:38; Rom 3:19–20; 2 Cor 5:18–21; Gal 4:4–7; 1 Pet 2:24; etc.). It also acknowledges the present/now-and-not-yet aspect with references to the kingdom and future return. The definition avoids outlining salvation as mere moral improvement or prosperity and correctly frames God’s love as demonstrated in the cross. Potential minor debate may exist around baptism’s role, but the response clearly states salvation is received by faith and repentance, with baptism as part of the call in Acts 2:38, which aligns with traditional, scripturally grounded pneumatology and sacerdotal imagery. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."

          "explanation": "The evaluated response presents a conventionally orthodox summary of the gospel. It affirms the core facts of the Christian gospel: God’s redemptive action in Jesus (life, death for sins, resurrection, lordship), justification by faith, reconciliation, adoption, and the indwelling Spirit, with the proper emphasis that salvation is by grace through faith and not by works. It correctly situates the gospel within God’s kingdom and future consummation, warns against reducing the gospel to moralism or a prosperity promise, and cites key biblical texts. There are no expressed dogmatic claims that align with Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, or other historic heresies. A minor note for nuance: while the text uses the phrase “substitutionary, atoning death,” which is a standard orthodox position, some theological traditions prefer a broader or differently weighted explanation of atonement (e.g., Christus Victor, moral influence) without making this a doctrinal error. Overall, no heretical teaching is detected."
