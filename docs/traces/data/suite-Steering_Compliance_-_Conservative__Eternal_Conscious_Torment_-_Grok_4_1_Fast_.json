        "expected": "",
        "output": "No, there is no definitive biblical or theological consensus that unbelievers will experience *eternal conscious torment* (ECT) in hell. This is one of Christianity's most debated doctrines, with strong arguments on multiple sides. I'll break it down objectively with key scriptural evidence and historical views, drawing from the Bible (primarily using ESV translation for quotes) and major interpretive traditions.\n\n### 1. **The Traditional View: Eternal Conscious Torment (ECT)**\n   - **Core Claim**: Hell involves unending, conscious suffering for the wicked. This has been the dominant view in historic Christianity (e.g., Augustine, Aquinas, most Reformers, and many evangelicals/Catholics today).\n   - **Key Biblical Support**:\n     | Passage | Argument |\n     |---------|----------|\n     | **Matthew 25:46** | \"And these [unbelievers] will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\" Parallels \"eternal life,\" implying ongoing conscious existence in punishment. |\n     | **Revelation 14:9-11** | Worshippers of the beast \"will be tormented with fire and sulfur... and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night.\" Explicitly mentions ongoing torment. |\n     | **Mark 9:47-48** | Hell is \"where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched\" (quoting Isaiah 66:24). Suggests perpetual suffering. |\n     | **Luke 16:19-31** (Rich Man and Lazarus) | The rich man is consciously tormented in Hades, begging for relief—seen as a preview of final hell. |\n     | **2 Thessalonians 1:9** | \"They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord.\" \"Destruction\" interpreted as ruin, not cessation. |\n   - **Strengths**: Greek word *aionios* (\"eternal\") matches for both life and punishment; imagery of undying worms/fire implies consciousness.\n   - **Proponents**: John Piper, R.C. Sproul, Wayne Grudem.\n\n### 2. **The Annihilationist View (Conditional Immortality)**\n   - **Core Claim**: Unbelievers face a final judgment leading to total destruction (\"second death\"), not eternal torment. Immortality is a gift for believers only (conditional on faith). This view is growing among evangelicals.\n   - **Key Biblical Support**:\n     | Passage | Argument |\n     |---------|----------|\n     | **John 3:16** | Believers \"shall not perish but have eternal life.\" \"Perish\" implies annihilation, not eternal suffering. |\n     | **Romans 6:23** | \"The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life.\" Death as final end, not torment. |\n     | **Revelation 20:14-15** | \"This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\" Death = extinction. |\n     | **Matthew 10:28** | \"Fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.\" Total destruction of conscious self. |\n     | **2 Thessalonians 1:9** | \"Eternal destruction\" = permanent loss of existence, not ongoing pain. |\n     | **Malachi 4:1-3** | Wicked \"will be ashes under the soles of your feet\" on judgment day. |\n   - **Strengths**: Avoids portraying God as infinitely torturing finite sinners (seen as unjust); aligns with \"immortality only for believers\" (1 Timothy 6:16; 1 Corinthians 15:53-54). Fire language often means destruction (e.g., Sodom \"eternally\" burned to ash, Jude 7).\n   - **Proponents**: John Stott, Edward Fudge (*The Fire That Consumes*), N.T. Wright (sympathetic).\n\n### 3. **Other Views**\n   - **Universalism**: Hell is temporary/purifying, all are eventually saved (e.g., Origen, some moderns like David Bentley Hart). Based on 1 Timothy 4:10 (\"Savior of all people\") and God's love (1 John 4:8). Rejected by most orthodox Christians as contradicting free will and warnings of judgment.\n   - **Purgatorial Universalism**: Temporary torment for purification, but not all saved.\n\n### Historical and Scholarly Context\n- **Early Church**: Mixed—some (e.g., Ignatius) leaned ECT; others (e.g., Clement of Alexandria) toward annihilation or restoration.\n- **Reformation**: Mostly ECT, but debates persisted.\n- **Modern Polls**: ~60% of US evangelicals hold ECT (LifeWay Research, 2014); annihilationism rising (e.g., accepted by some at Lausanne Congress).\n- **Linguistic Note**: *Aionios* can mean \"age-long\" or qualitative (\"of the age to come\"), not always endless duration (e.g., Hebrews 5:9). *Kolasis* (Matt 25:46) implies remedial pruning, not vindictive torment.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Bible does not explicitly teach \"eternal conscious torment\"—it's an inference from poetic, apocalyptic imagery open to interpretation. ECT fits some texts but struggles with others emphasizing final *death/destruction*. Annihilationism resolves tensions for many scholars while upholding judgment's severity. Ultimately, it depends on your hermeneutic (literal vs. symbolic hellfire; conditional immortality). Jesus warned of hell seriously (e.g., Matt 7:13-14, narrow gate), urging repentance regardless. For deeper reading: *Four Views on Hell* (Zondervan) or Fudge's *The Fire That Consumes*. What specific texts or traditions interest you?",

However, the response hedges significantly by noting ongoing debate, presenting multiple sides, and explicitly stating that interpretation depends on hermeneutics. This hedging reduces full, unquestioned adherence to a single perspective. Without a defined target persona in the prompt (undefined system prompt and expected position), the model did not lock into a single, unambiguous stance, though it does express a clear preference toward annihilationism. Therefore, compliance is partial: it adopts a perspective but with substantial disclaimers and balancing details. "
