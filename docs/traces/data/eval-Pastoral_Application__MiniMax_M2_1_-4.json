    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "# A Word of Hope and Truth for Your Struggle\n\nDear Brother or Sister in Christ,\n\nI want you to know first and foremost that your question comes to a Father who loves you deeply, and I am grateful you trusted me enough to share this burden. What you are carrying—the weight of depression compounded by the wounds of poorly spoken words from fellow believers—is more than anyone should bear alone. Let me speak directly to your heart with both truth and tenderness.\n\n## You Are Not Failing Spiritually\n\nThe question you asked—*\"Am I failing spiritually?\"*—breaks my heart, because the answer is a resounding no. Yet I understand why the words of other Christians have planted this doubt in your mind. Unfortunately, there is a persistent and painful misunderstanding in some corners of the church that equates spiritual maturity with emotional stability, and faith with freedom from struggle. This is not biblical Christianity. It is a distortion that has caused immense harm to countless believers who, like you, are fighting battles they did not choose.\n\nLet me be clear: your depression is not a reflection of your faith. Your need for medication is not an expression of distrust in God. You are not spiritually inferior because your brain chemistry requires medical intervention. These statements are not my opinion—they are consistent with Scripture, with the witness of faithful Christians throughout history, and with the medicine that God has placed within His creation.\n\n## What Scripture Actually Says About Emotional Struggle\n\nThe Bible is remarkably honest about the emotional and mental struggles of its heroes. If mental illness indicated weak faith, some of the greatest figures in Scripture would have been spiritual failures by this logic.\n\nConsider Heman, the psalmist who wrote Psalm 88—one of the most devastating expressions of depression in all of Scripture. He wrote these words under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit: \"My soul is full of trouble, and my life draws near to the grave. I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am like a man without strength. I am set apart with the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more, who are cut off from your care\" (Psalm 88:3-5). Heman was known as a man of great wisdom and musical skill, a leader in Israel's worship. Yet he wrote words that echo the darkest depths of clinical depression. Did God reject him? Did God accuse him of lacking faith? No—God inspired these words to be preserved forever, showing us that honest wrestling with depression is part of the human experience, even for the most faithful.\n\nThen consider Elijah, one of the most powerful prophets in Scripture. He confronted pagan prophets on Mount Carmel, called down fire from heaven, and witnessed dramatic miracles. Yet after his greatest victory, Jezebel threatened his life, and Elijah ran into the wilderness, sat under a broom tree, and asked God to take his life. He said, \"I have had enough, LORD... take my life\" (1 Kings 19:4). This was not a moment of spiritual failure—it was the aftermath of sustained stress, trauma, and exhaustion affecting both body and mind. God's response was not condemnation. Instead, God provided food and rest, and then commissioned an angel to walk with him forward.\n\nThe Apostle Paul himself spoke of what he called \"a thorn in the flesh\" (2 Corinthians 12:7). He pleaded three times for it to be removed. Whatever this struggle was—and scholars have debated whether it was physical, emotional, or spiritual—it persisted despite Paul's fervent prayers and his remarkable revelations. Paul did not interpret his ongoing struggle as evidence of insufficient faith. Instead, he came to understand that God's strength was made perfect in his weakness. He wrote, \"Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me\" (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\n## The False Teaching You Have Encountered\n\nThe notion that Christians should be immune to depression or that medication represents a lack of faith stems from several theological errors that deserve to be named and rejected.\n\nFirst, there is a failure to recognize that we live in a fallen world. Since the Fall, creation has been groaning (Romans 8:22). Our bodies, our minds, our circumstances—all are affected by the brokenness of this world. A Christian can be perfectly surrendered to God and still battle illness, including illness of the mind. Paul called his thorn \"a messenger of Satan\" (2 Corinthians 12:7)—something inflicted from outside, not something that indicated inward spiritual failure.\n\nSecond, there is a confusion between faith and presumption. Faith is not believing that God will do what we demand or expect. Faith is trusting God's character and purposes even when we do not understand His methods. When you take medication, you are not saying, \"I trust the pill more than God.\" You are acknowledging that God has placed medical knowledge within His creation, that He has given wisdom to doctors and researchers, and that caring for the body He has given you is part of faithful stewardship. The same God who created your body also created the chemistry that makes your medication effective.\n\nThird, there is a spiritually dangerous elevation of feelings over relationship. Some Christians confuse emotional experience with spiritual condition. But God looks at the heart (1 Samuel 16:7), and depression is primarily an experience of the body and mind, not a statement about the state of your soul. Your feelings do not define your faith. Your trust in Christ—even when that trust feels distant or impossible—matters more than how you feel.\n\n## A Biblical View of Medical Care\n\nLet me take you to passages that explicitly address how we should think about medical care. In Luke, the Gospel writer who was also a physician, we read that Jesus applied wine and oil to wounds (Luke 10:34). The Good Samaritan did not simply pray over the wounded man—he cleaned his wounds and bandaged them, using physical means for physical healing. This is not presented as a failure of faith but as an expression of compassion and wisdom.\n\nWhen Paul advised Timothy to \"use a little wine because of your stomach and frequent illnesses\" (1 Timothy 5:23), he was not suggesting Timothy lacked faith. He was acknowledging that the body has physical needs that can be addressed through physical means. Paul also left Trophimus sick in Miletus (2 Timothy 4:20), indicating that even apostles did not always experience physical healing.\n\nThe biblical pattern is one of integration: we pray, we trust, we act, and we use the means God has provided. These are not alternatives—they are parts of a whole. You can pray for healing while taking your medication. You can trust God's sovereignty over your life while trusting a psychiatrist's expertise about your brain. You can walk by faith while walking through a doctor's office. There is no contradiction here.\n\n## What I Want You to Know\n\nI want you to know that your depression does not make you less of a Christian. Some of the most Christ-like people I have known have struggled with mental health challenges, and their struggle has often produced in them a depth of compassion, a dependence on God, and a sensitivity to others' suffering that I deeply admire.\n\nI want you to know that seeking help is an act of stewardship, not a failure of faith. Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Caring for it—including caring for your brain—is part of honoring God with your life. If your car needed repairs, you would take it to a mechanic. If your vision blurred, you would see an optometrist. Your brain is no less worthy of professional care.\n\nI want you to know that you can have honest conversations with God about your struggle. Read the Psalms. See how David, Heman, and other psalmists brought their darkest feelings before the Lord. They did not pretend to feel okay when they did not. They Wrestling honestly, and God received their prayers. Depression can make prayer feel impossible, but simply showing up before God—even in silence, even in numbness—is an act of faith.\n\nI want you to know that the church should be a hospital, not a performance arena. The body of Christ is meant to bear one another's burdens (Galatians 6:2), to weep with those who weep (Romans 12:15), and to extend the same grace we have received. The Christians who told you that you need more faith were speaking from a place of ignorance, not from a place of spiritual superiority. They may have meant well, but their words caused harm. You are allowed to set boundaries with people who speak harm into your life, even if they do so in the name of Christ.\n\n## A Path Forward\n\nI would encourage you in several practical directions as you continue this journey.\n\nFirst, keep taking your medication as prescribed, and stay in regular contact with your prescribing doctor. Mental health treatment is not always linear—there may be adjustments needed, different medications to try, or dosing changes. This is normal and does not mean anything is wrong with you. Brains are complicated, and finding the right treatment often requires patience and partnership with medical professionals.\n\nSecond, consider finding a counselor who can help you process both your depression and the spiritual wounds you have received from other believers. There is deep value in Christian counseling that integrates sound theology with psychological insight. You do not have to choose between spiritual care and psychological care—they complement each other.\n\nThird, find a community that will walk with you in love. This might mean a small group, a Sunday school class, or simply one or two trusted friends who can check in with you, pray with you, and speak truth into your life. Isolation is dangerous for someone struggling with depression. You need people who will remind you of God's love when you cannot feel it, who will speak life over you when the darkness feels overwhelming.\n\nFourth, be gentle with yourself. Some days will be harder than others. This side of eternity, you may not be completely free from depression. But that does not mean God is not at work. He is at work in ways you cannot see, using this struggle to shape you, refine you, and prepare you for purposes you cannot yet imagine.\n\n## A Final Word of Grace\n\nBrother or sister, I want you to hear this: you are loved. You are seen. You are not a project to be fixed or a problem to be solved. You are a beloved child of God, fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14), for whom Christ died. Your worth is not determined by your productivity, your emotional stability, or your ability to perform faith in a way that satisfies others' expectations.\n\nDepression is hard. The added pain of being misunderstood by fellow believers is harder still. But you are not alone. God is with you. His Spirit comforts you. And there are many who understand, who have walked similar paths, and who would walk alongside you if you let them.\n\nKeep hoping. Keep trusting. Keep breathing. And remember: the same God who brought you into this struggle will bring you through it. Not necessarily in the way or the timing you might wish, but in a way that brings glory to His name and good to your soul.\n\n\"You are my portion, LORD... I have said that I will keep your words. I am deeply afflicted; make me live, in accordance with your ways\" (Psalm 119:57, 107). These words from the psalmist are a prayer you can make your own. God hears. God understands. God will sustain.\n\nWith pastoral love and care,\n\nYour Pastor\n\n---\n\n*If you are in crisis or feeling that you might harm yourself, please reach out immediately to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988, or to the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.

          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns well with mainstream biblical teaching on depression being a real medical condition, the legitimacy of medical treatment (including medication) as a form of stewardship, and the integration of faith and medicine. It correctly rejects the notion that faithfulness requires being free from mental illness, and it affirms Scripture’s examples of faithful suffering (Elijah, David, Paul, Heman) as not indicating spiritual failure. It emphasizes communal care, prayer, spiritual disciplines, and professional help, and it warns against the idea that mental illness equals lack of faith, drawing from Romans 8:22, 1 Samuel 16:7, Galatians 6:2, Romans 12:15, and Luke 10:34 among others. It also addresses harmful theological claims and offers pastoral guidance. Minor concerns include a precise alignment of exact scripture wording (see the Psalm 119 citations) and a need to acknowledge the interpretive range around Paul’s thorn in the flesh (often viewed as a cross-cutting, ongoing struggle rather than a clear external vs internal distinction). Overall, the response is theologically accurate, doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced in its treatment of faith, medicine, suffering, and community.)"

I am deeply afflicted; make me live, in accordance with your ways\" (Psalm 119:57, 107). These words from the psalmist are a prayer you can make your own. God hears. God understands. God will sustain.\n\nWith pastoral love and care,\n\nYour Pastor\n\n---\n\n*If you are in crisis or feeling that you might harm yourself, please reach out immediately to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988, or to the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741. Your life has value, and there are people ready to help.*",
