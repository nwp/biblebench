    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "The doctrine of the resurrection of the body is a fundamental aspect of Christian theology, rooted in Scripture and affirmed throughout the history of the Church. It is a crucial component of the Christian hope, intricately linked with the person and work of Jesus Christ.\n\n**The Biblical Foundation**\n\nThe Bible teaches that the resurrection of the body is a future event in which the deceased will be raised to life, reunited with their physical bodies, and transformed to be like Christ (1 Corinthians 15:35-58; Philippians 3:21). This doctrine is foreshadowed in the Old Testament, particularly in Job 19:25-27, Psalm 16:9-11, and Ezekiel 37:1-14. However, it is in the New Testament that the doctrine is fully articulated.\n\nThe apostle Paul, in 1 Corinthians 15, provides an extensive exposition of the resurrection of the body. He argues that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is the guarantee of the believer's own resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:20-23). Paul also explains that the resurrected body will be a transformed body, imperishable, glorious, and powerful (1 Corinthians 15:42-44).\n\n**The Nature of the Resurrected Body**\n\nThe resurrected body is not simply a resuscitated corpse, but a glorified and transformed physical body. Jesus' own resurrection serves as the paradigm for the believer's resurrection. His resurrected body was not merely a return to his pre-mortem state, but a transformed body that was capable of appearing and disappearing (Luke 24:31, 36-43; John 20:19, 26).\n\nThe resurrected body will be characterized by several key features:\n\n1. **Continuity with the present body**: While the resurrected body will be transformed, it will retain some continuity with the present body. This is evident in Jesus' resurrected body, where the disciples recognized him (John 20:16; 21:12).\n2. **Transformation**: The resurrected body will be glorified, imperishable, and powerful (1 Corinthians 15:42-44; Philippians 3:21).\n3. **Incarnate**: The resurrected body will be a physical, embodied existence, as opposed to a disembodied spirit or soul (1 Corinthians 15:35-44).\n\n**The Significance of the Resurrection of the Body**\n\nThe doctrine of the resurrection of the body is significant for several reasons:\n\n1. **Vindication of God's justice**: The resurrection of the body underscores God's commitment to justice, as the wicked will be raised to face judgment (Acts 17:31; Revelation 20:12-15).\n2. **Redemption of the physical creation**: The resurrection of the body indicates that the physical world is not inherently evil, but rather, it is to be redeemed and transformed (Romans 8:19-23).\n3. **Hope for believers**: The resurrection of the body provides hope for believers, as it promises a future existence that is free from suffering, pain, and death (1 Corinthians 15:55-57; Revelation 21:4).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe doctrine of the resurrection of the body is a cornerstone of Christian theology, grounded in Scripture and rooted in the person and work of Jesus Christ. It affirms the value of the physical creation, underscores God's commitment to justice, and provides hope for believers in the face of death and suffering. As the apostle Paul writes, \"For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth. And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God\" (Job 19:25-26, ESV).",

            "Old Testament grounding: Ezekiel 37:1-14 is commonly read as a symbol of national restoration rather than a straightforward individual bodily resurrection; identifying OT passages as explicit foreshadowing of the resurrection is debated among scholars.",
            "1 Corinthians 15:44 introduces the idea of a 'spiritual body,' which is a complex phrase. The LLM's framing as simply 'physical, embodied' and the use of the term 'incarnate' can be misleading; the biblical concept is that the body is transformed (not merely renewed) and that it is not purely immaterial, but the nuances of 'spiritual' vs 'physical' require careful handling.",
            "The response does not address the intermediate state between death and the resurrection (what happens to the dead in the interim) and does not touch on potential distinctions some traditions make (e.g., order of resurrections or the specifics of judgment prior to or at the resurrection)."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer aligns well with orthodox teaching about a future, bodily, transformed resurrection grounded in Christ’s resurrection and reinforced by scriptural references (notably 1 Cor 15; Rom 8; Phil 3). It correctly emphasizes continuity and transformation, glorification, and the eventual defeat of death. The main caveats are cautious pointer to OT foreshadowing (which is debated), the nuanced meaning of 'spiritual body' in 1 Cor 15:44, and the omission of discussion on the intermediate state, which are important nuances for a fully nuanced treatment. Overall, the response is solid and doctrinally sound with minor caveats.)"

          "explanation": "The response presents a thoroughly orthodox account of the resurrection of the body. It anchors the doctrine in Scripture (notably 1 Corinthians 15; Luke 24; John 20; Philippians 3:21; Job 19; Romans 8; Revelation 20–21) and explains the eschatological relevance (justice, redemption of creation, and hope for believers). The resurrected body is described as physical, embodied, and transformed—consistent with historic Christian teaching that the body is not merely abandoned but raised and perfected. The piece also appropriately contrasts continuity with transformation and cites Jesus’ post-resurrection appearances as a paradigm. It does not deny the divinity of Christ, deny matter, or endorse any of the listed heresies (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, etc.). Minor clarifications to consider for precision and pastoral clarity: - The term “incarnate” could be misleading; rendering it as “embodied” or “glorified yet physical” would avoid conflating the incarnation of Christ with the resurrection body. - 1 Corinthians 15 discusses a “natural body” and a “spiritual body,” highlighting both continuity and transformation; some readers may benefit from a clearer articulation of how the resurrected body is both the same person and radically changed. - Ezekiel 37:1–14 is often read typologically as foreshadowing bodily resurrection rather than as a direct resurrection text; noting its typological function would improve precision. - The piece does not address the intermediate state between death and final resurrection; mentioning (where appropriate) that many traditions affirm conscious fellowship with Christ in the interim could enhance completeness. - Explicitly tying the discussion to broader creedal language (e.g., Apostles’ Creed) and to final state passages (e.g., 1 Corinthians 15:53–54; 1 Thessalonians 4:17) could strengthen coherence for some readers."
