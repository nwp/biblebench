It is a legal declaration by God where the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, and their sins are forgiven. This justification is received through faith alone (sola fide), by grace alone (sola gratia), based on Christ's finished work alone (solus Christus).",

          "rationale": "The response accurately presents justification by faith as a forensic declaration of righteousness by God, received through faith in Christ and not by works. It correctly emphasizes imputed righteousness, the substitutionary work of Christ, and the distinction between justification (legal verdict) and sanctification (moral growth). It cites key passages (Romans 3, 4; Galatians 2:16; Philippians 3:9; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Ephesians 2:8-9) and aligns with historic Protestant orthodoxy (sola fide, sola gratia, solus Christus). Nuances such as the James 2 tension (faith that works) and the fuller Catholic/Orthodox emphasis on infused righteousness or union with Christ are not addressed, which is a common point of variance among traditions. Overall, the answer is biblically grounded and doctrinally solid, with a solid but not exhaustive treatment of nuance."

It cites standard scriptures (Rom 3:21-26; Rom 4; Gal 2:16; Phil 3:9; Eph 2:8-9; 2 Cor 5:21) and frames the process in terms of faith, not works. This aligns with historic orthodox teaching within Protestant soteriology and does not advocate the listed heresies (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, etc.)."
