    "expected": "The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became human, lived a perfect life, died on the cross as a substitute for sinners, rose from the dead, and now offers salvation and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe in him. It proclaims that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, not earned by human effort, received through faith in Christ alone.",
    "output": "Short definition\n- The word gospel (Greek euangelion) means “good news.” Biblically the gospel is the good news that God has acted in Jesus Christ to redeem sinners, defeat death and evil, and to inaugurate God’s new creation; this salvation is received by repentance and faith and will be consummated when Christ returns (cf. Mark 1:1; Luke 4:18–21; 1 Cor 15:1–4; Romans 1:16–17).\n\nCore factual claims (what happened)\n- God became flesh in Jesus (the Incarnation) and lived a sinless life (John 1:14; Heb 4:15).\n- Jesus died in our place, bearing sin’s penalty and reconciling sinners to God (the atonement/substitution) (1 Cor 15:3; Romans 3:24–26; 2 Cor 5:21; 1 Peter 2:24).\n- God raised Jesus bodily from the dead, vindicating his work and inaugurating new life (1 Cor 15:4–8; Acts 2:22–36).\n- Jesus ascended and is now exalted, ruling as Lord and sending the Spirit to renew his people and empower mission (Acts 1:9–11; Eph 1:20–23; John 14–16).\n\nBasic theological results (what it means)\n- Forgiveness and justification: sinners are declared righteous by God through Christ, not by works but by faith (Rom 3:21–28; Gal 2:16).\n- New birth and indwelling Spirit: believers are regenerated, adopted as God’s children, and enabled for holy living (Titus 3:4–7; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 4:4–7; Eph 1:13–14).\n- Victory over sin, death, and evil: Christ’s death and resurrection break sin’s power and guarantee believers’ future resurrection (Rom 6; 1 Cor 15; Col 2:15).\n- Kingdom: God’s righteous rule is inaugurated in Christ (already) and will be fully realized at his return (not yet) (Luke 11:20; Matt 13; Rev 21–22).\n\nHow people receive it\n- The gospel is received by repentance and faith: turning from sin and trusting Christ alone for salvation (Acts 2:38; Mark 1:15; Eph 2:8–9). Faith is not mere assent but personal reliance on Christ and his work.\n\nWhy it is distinct and central\n- The gospel is not primarily a moral program or self-improvement plan. It is news about what God has done in Christ for sinners and the new life that results. Paul says the gospel is of “first importance”: Christ died for our sins, was buried, and raised (1 Cor 15:3–4). Christianity is therefore centered on a person and his saving work, not chiefly on rules or ideology (Phil 3:8–9).\n\nPractical and pastoral corollaries\n- The gospel produces assurance of forgiveness, hope of resurrection, gratitude, worship, obedience, and mission (Rom 5–8; Matt 28:18–20).\n- The church proclaims this message, administers the means of grace (Word, sacraments), and bears witness to the kingdom until Christ returns.\n\nBrief note on emphases\n- Different traditions highlight aspects of Christ’s saving work (e.g., penal substitution, Christus Victor, moral exemplar), but historically and biblically the core gospel affirms Christ’s atoning death and victorious resurrection, justification by grace through faith, and the new creation inaugurated in him (Col 1:19–20; 2 Cor 5:17).\n\nOne-sentence summary\n- The gospel is the good news that God, in Christ—through his life, substitutionary death, and bodily resurrection—has removed sin’s guilt and power, brought people into a reconciled relationship with himself by grace through faith, and will perfect his renewed creation when Christ returns (1 Cor 15:1–4; Rom 3:21–26; Rev 21–22).",

          "rationale": "The LLM response presents a robust, orthodox account of the gospel. It correctly identifies the core events: Incarnation, sinless life, substitutionary atonement, bodily resurrection, and ascension, followed by the sending of the Spirit. It accurately states the doctrinal meanings: justification by faith, new birth and Spirit-filled life, victory over sin and death, and the inaugurated but not yet complete kingdom. It emphasizes that salvation is by grace through faith (not by works) and that repentance accompanies faith, while acknowledging differing traditional emphases (e.g., penal substitution, Christus Victor, moral example). It grounds claims in key Scripture references and articulates the gospel’s centrality and practical pastoral implications. A few minor nuances (e.g., the precise scope of “defeat of evil” and the tension of “already/not yet”) are handled at a standard evangelical level and do not undermine the overall accuracy. No clear theological errors are present. "

          "explanation": "Evaluation: The response presents orthodox Christian core beliefs: the incarnation, sinless life, substitutionary atonement, bodily resurrection, ascension and lordship, the Spirit’s renewal of believers, justification by grace through faith, new birth, and future resurrection and the kingdom. It emphasizes salvation as God’s action in Christ rather than human works, while describing faith as trust, not mere assent. It acknowledges different atonement motifs (penal substitution, Christus Victor, moral influence) without treating any as exclusive or heretical. There is no denial of Christ’s divinity (ruling out Arianism), no modalism, no Gnosticism, no Docetism, and no Pelagian emphasis on salvation by works. Overall, the text aligns with historic orthodoxy; if anything, it notes ecumenical diversity in atonement language rather than endorsing a heresy."
