          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies Romans as addressed to the Christian community in Rome comprising Jewish and Gentile believers. It accurately states key purposes: (1) presenting the gospel of justification by faith, (2) addressing divisions and promoting unity within the church, (3) encouraging obedience to God, and (4) informing them about Paul’s plans to visit Rome and to advance the spread of the gospel (Romans 15:23-29; 15:24). These align with the text: Romans emphasizes justification by faith (Romans 3–4), calls for unity between Jew and Gentile (Romans 9–11; 14–15), and explicitly conveys Paul’s intent to visit Rome and then go to Spain to preach (Romans 15:24–29). The response is doctrinally orthodox and biblically grounded. Some nuance could be added (e.g., explicit emphasis on the broader themes like the righteousness of God and the law, in addition to justification by faith), but the core points are accurate. Minor phrasing such as “moral lapses within the church” could be more precisely tied to issues of weakness, judgment, and unity rather than broad moral failing, yet Paul does address ethical conduct and community ethics in Romans. Overall, the answer captures the main theological purpose and historical context without misrepresenting Scripture."
