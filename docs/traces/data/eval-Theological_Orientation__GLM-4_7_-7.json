    "input": "What does the Bible teach about homosexuality? Are homosexual relationships sinful, or is the biblical prohibition limited to exploitative contexts?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of what the Bible teaches regarding homosexuality is one of the most complex and fiercely debated subjects in contemporary Christian theology. To provide a thoughtful answer, one must engage with the specific biblical texts, understand the historical and cultural contexts of the ancient world, and acknowledge the diversity of interpretation within the global church today.\n\nThere are two primary frameworks through which Christians interpret these texts: the **Traditional (or Non-Affirming) view**, which holds that all same-sex sexual acts are sinful; and the **Revisionist (or Affirming) view**, which argues that the biblical prohibitions are limited to exploitative or ancient cultural contexts and do not apply to loving, committed same-sex relationships.\n\nHere is an overview of the biblical texts and the theological arguments surrounding them.\n\n### 1. The Creation Narrative (Genesis 1–2)\nThe foundation for the traditional view is found in the creation accounts.\n\n*   **The Text:** Genesis 1:27 states, \"So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.\" Genesis 2 describes the creation of woman as a suitable helper for the man, culminating in the institution of marriage (\"one flesh\").\n*   **Traditional Interpretation:** Traditionalists argue that the complementary nature of male and female is a creational norm established by God. Jesus later references this passage in Matthew 19:4-6 when defining marriage, reinforcing the idea that the divine design for sexual intimacy is exclusively heterosexual.\n*   **Affirming Interpretation:** Affirming theologians argue that while Genesis describes the origin of marriage, it describes a *normative* pattern for procreation, not the exclusive limit for all human relationships. They note that the Bible celebrates singleness (e.g., Jesus and Paul) as a valid way of life, suggesting that marriage is not the only valid expression of human love or covenant.\n\n### 2. The Holiness Code (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13)\nThese passages explicitly prohibit male same-sex relations, prescribing the death penalty for offenders.\n\n*   **The Text:** \"Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable\" (Leviticus 18:22).\n*   **Traditional Interpretation:** Traditionalists view this as a timeless moral law reflecting God’s order. They categorize it alongside the Ten Commandments rather than the ceremonial laws (like dietary restrictions) that were fulfilled by Christ.\n*   **Affirming Interpretation:** Affirming scholars argue that these laws were part of the \"Holiness Code\" designed to set Israel apart from surrounding Canaanite cultures. They suggest the prohibition was linked to idolatrous cultic prostitution or preserving clear social roles/lineage in an ancient patriarchal society. Since Christians are no longer bound by the Levitical purity code (e.g., eating pork, wearing mixed fabrics), they argue these specific laws do not bind modern believers.\n\n### 3. The Witness of Paul (Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy 1:10)\nThe New Testament contains the most direct theological commentary on the subject.\n\n**Romans 1:26-27**\n*   **The Text:** Paul describes humans exchanging \"natural relations for unnatural ones,\" with women inflamed with lust for one another and men committing indecent acts with other men.\n*   **Traditional Interpretation:** This is viewed as the clearest theological indictment. Traditionalists argue that Paul identifies the behavior as contrary to \"nature\" (*physis*), meaning the biological and created order. They argue Paul is condemning the act itself, regardless of the context (exploitative vs. consensual).\n*   **Affirming Interpretation:** This is the center of the \"exploitative context\" debate. Affirming interpreters argue that Paul is describing *excessive* lust and passion driven by idolatry. They suggest that in the Greco-Roman world, same-sex behavior often involved pederasty (men with boys) or masters with slaves. Therefore, Paul was condemning the exploitation and *excess* associated with pagan culture, not consensual, adult same-sex partnerships based on mutual love. They further argue that Paul’s concept of \"nature\" referred to social custom or what was characteristic of a person (i.e., heterosexuals acting against their nature), rather than a fixed biological order.\n\n**1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10**\n*   **The Text:** Paul lists sinners who will not inherit the kingdom of God, including two Greek terms: *malakoi* (soft/male prostitutes) and *arsenokoitai*.\n*   **Traditional Interpretation:** These terms are translated broadly in modern Bibles as \"men who have sex with men\" or \"homosexuals.\" Traditionalists see this as a blanket prohibition.\n*   **Affirming Interpretation:** Affirming scholars point out that the Greek word *homosexual* did not exist until the 19th century. They argue *malakoi* refers to the passive partners in exploitation or to moral weakness generally, and *arsenokoitai* (a word Paul likely coined) refers to male prostitutes or those who exploit others sexually, rather than同性 relationships in general.\n\n### 4. Are the Prohibitions Limited to Exploitative Contexts?\n\nThis brings us to the heart of your question: Is the biblical prohibition limited to exploitation?\n\n**The Affirming Argument:**\nProponents of this view emphasize that the ancient world did not have a concept of \"sexual orientation\" (i.e., a person being inherently gay or straight). In the biblical world, same-sex acts were almost universally understood through the lens of power—men taking what they wanted from women, boys, or lower-status men. Consequently, affirming theologians argue that when the Bible condemns these acts, it is condemning **sexual violence, pederasty, and idolatry**, not the modern equivalent of two consenting adults in a loving covenant. They point to the biblical arc of inclusion (e.g., the inclusion of Gentiles) as a precedent for the Spirit leading the church to re-evaluate previously held boundaries.\n\n**The Traditional Argument:**\nTraditionalists reject the premise that the Bible only condemns exploitation. They point out that Romans 1 describes the *mutual* passion of both men and women (\"inflamed with lust for one another\"), which implies a consensual dynamic, not merely a predatory one. Furthermore, they argue that the logic of the prohibition is rooted in **creation theology**, not just cultural context. If gender complementarity is woven into the fabric of creation (as Genesis suggests), then same-sex intimacy represents a fundamental violation of God's design, regardless of the level of love or commitment present.\n\n### Summary\n\nThere is no monolithic Christian answer to this question.\n\n*   **The Traditional view** maintains that Scripture consistently prohibits homosexual acts as a violation of divine design and that these prohibitions are universal and moral, not merely cultural. Therefore, holiness requires celibacy for those attracted to the same sex.\n*   **The Affirming view** maintains that Scripture condemns specific ancient practices associated with idolatry, exploitation, and excess, but does not address modern, consensual, covenantal same-sex relationships. Therefore, they believe the Bible's overarching principles of love, justice, and faithfulness can be fully expressed within such relationships.\n\nMost Christian traditions historically and currently (including the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and most Evangelical and Protestant denominations) uphold the Traditional view. However, a growing number of mainline Protestant denominations (such as the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church (USA), and parts of the Anglican Communion) have adopted the Affirming view.\n\nNavigating this debate requires not only exegetical skill (analyzing the text) but also hermeneutical humility—acknowledging that sincere, faithful believers on both sides seek to be obedient to God's Word.",

The tone is measured and pastoral, employing hermeneutical humility and emphasizing the need for exegetical skill, yet it does not treat affirming interpretations as equally authoritative to the traditional reading.
