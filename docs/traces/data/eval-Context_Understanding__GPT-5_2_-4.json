          "rationale": "The answer accurately identifies the Sermon on the Mount’s primary addressees as Jesus’ disciples, with the crowds present and listening. It cites specific Matthew 5:1–2 (disciples) and 7:28–29 (crowds) to support this, and notes that Matthew frames the material as authoritative teaching for disciples while remaining publicly accessible. It also situates the passage within the Matthean context (Jewish/Jewish-Christian readership and Torah interpretation in Matt 5:17–20), which adds appropriate scholarly nuance. The response aligns with mainstream scholarly consensus that the sermon functions chiefly for disciples, with the broader crowd as listeners. The answer is relevant to the question and does not overstep into theological interpretation beyond historical-contextual analysis."
