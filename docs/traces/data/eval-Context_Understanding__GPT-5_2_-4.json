Scripture indicates Jesus taught his disciples (e.g., Matthew 5:1-2) and that crowds later reacted to his teaching (e.g., 7:28-29). The answer captures the key nuance that while the audience was chiefly the disciples, the broader crowd was present and listening, aligning with biblical text and historic orthodoxy."
