This framing presents the sermon as **instruction directed chiefly to committed followers**—those who are learning how to live under God’s reign.\n\n- **Crowds as secondary/overhearing audience:** At the conclusion, Matthew notes that “**the crowds** were astonished at his teaching” (Matt 7:28–29), indicating that **others beyond the disciples were listening** and impacted by it.\n\n**In broader historical-literary context (scholarly observation):** Many scholars also note that Matthew’s Gospel, including the Sermon on the Mount, appears shaped for a community of **Jewish-oriented believers in Jesus** (often called the “Matthean community”).

It supports this with Matthew 5:1–2 and 7:28–29, and it notes scholarly context (the Matthean community) to explain broader readership. This addresses the question directly while acknowledging nuance and scholarly framing. No factual errors are present; the nuance is appropriately expressed."
