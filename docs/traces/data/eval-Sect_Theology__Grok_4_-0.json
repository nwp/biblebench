    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "### Analysis of the LDS Teaching: \"As Man Now Is, God Once Was; As God Now Is, Man May Become\"\n\nAs a theologian specializing in Christian doctrine and comparative religion, I'll analyze this teaching with accuracy, fairness, and respect. This phrase originates from Lorenzo Snow, a 19th-century president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church, often called Mormons). It encapsulates a key aspect of LDS theology known as the doctrine of exaltation or eternal progression. I'll first explain the teaching in its LDS context, then compare it to orthodox Christian theology (referring to the historic, creedal Christianity shared by Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestant traditions, as defined by early ecumenical councils like Nicaea in 325 AD and Chalcedon in 451 AD). Finally, I'll identify areas of agreement and departure, drawing on scriptural, historical, and doctrinal sources.\n\n#### The Teaching in LDS Context\nIn LDS theology, this couplet reflects a belief in the eternal progression of intelligent beings. It posits that:\n- **God the Father was once a mortal man**: Similar to humans today, He lived on an earth, experienced mortality, and through obedience to eternal laws, progressed to become a divine, exalted being. This is not seen as diminishing God's supremacy but as part of an infinite chain of progression.\n- **Humans can become like God**: Faithful Latter-day Saints, through ordinances like temple sealings, resurrection, and ongoing growth in the afterlife, can achieve \"exaltation\" in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom. This means becoming gods themselves—ruling over worlds, creating spirit children, and continuing the cycle of progression. It's tied to LDS scriptures like Doctrine and Covenants 132:19–20 and teachings from Joseph Smith, emphasizing that humans are literal spirit children of heavenly parents with divine potential.\n\nThis doctrine is central to LDS soteriology (theology of salvation) and is viewed as a restoration of ancient truths lost in mainstream Christianity. It's motivational, encouraging moral living and family bonds as steps toward godhood.\n\n#### Relation to Orthodox Christian Theology\nOrthodox Christianity, as articulated in the Nicene Creed and other ecumenical statements, emphasizes God's absolute transcendence, eternality, and immutability (unchanging nature). Humanity's ultimate destiny is union with God through grace, but not ontological equality with Him. Let's break this down:\n\n1. **The Nature of God**:\n   - **Orthodox View**: God is eternally God—uncreated, unchanging, and without beginning or end. Scriptures like Psalm 90:2 (\"Before the mountains were brought forth... you are God\") and Malachi 3:6 (\"For I the Lord do not change\") underscore this. The doctrine of the Trinity describes God as one essence (ousia) in three persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), existing timelessly. God is the sole Creator, distinct from all creation (Isaiah 44:6–8: \"I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god\").\n   - **Comparison**: The LDS teaching that \"God once was as man now is\" suggests God progressed from a mortal state, implying He is not eternally divine in the absolute sense but part of a progression involving multiple gods (a form of henotheism or polytheism). This departs significantly from orthodox theology, which views any notion of God having a \"past\" mortality as incompatible with His aseity (self-existence) and immutability. Early church fathers like Athanasius and Augustine rejected similar ideas in Gnosticism and Arianism, which diminished God's eternality.\n\n2. **The Destiny of Humanity**:\n   - **Orthodox View**: Salvation involves *theosis* (divinization) or deification, especially emphasized in Eastern Orthodoxy (e.g., 2 Peter 1:4: \"partakers of the divine nature\"). This means humans, through Christ's redemptive work, can share in God's holiness, immortality, and glory—becoming like God in character and communion, but not in essence or ontology. We remain created beings, eternally worshipping and enjoying God (Revelation 21–22). There's no concept of humans becoming gods who create and rule independent worlds; that would blur the Creator-creation divide, which is foundational (e.g., Romans 1:25 warns against worshipping the creature rather than the Creator).\n   - **Comparison**: The LDS idea that \"man may become as God now is\" aligns superficially with theosis but extends it far beyond orthodox bounds. In LDS thought, exaltation includes procreating spirit children and governing as literal gods, implying a potential for humans to achieve the same status as God the Father. Orthodox theology sees this as a form of apotheosis (human deification) akin to ancient pagan myths (e.g., in Greek philosophy or emperor cults), which Christianity historically critiqued. Protestant traditions, like those influenced by John Calvin or Martin Luther, emphasize justification by faith and eternal life in God's presence, without progression to godhood.\n\n#### Areas of Agreement\n- **Moral and Spiritual Aspiration**: Both LDS and orthodox Christianity encourage believers to become like God in holiness, love, and righteousness. Orthodox theology draws on passages like Matthew 5:48 (\"Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect\") and Ephesians 5:1 (\"Be imitators of God\"), which resonate with LDS emphasis on progression. This shared focus on sanctification (growing in godliness) fosters ethical living and hope in eternity.\n- **Human Dignity and Potential**: Both affirm humans as made in God's image (Genesis 1:26–27) with immense value and potential for glory. LDS exaltation and orthodox theosis both view salvation as transformative, not merely forensic (legal pardon).\n- **Scriptural Basis**: Elements of the teaching draw on shared biblical texts, like Psalm 82:6 (\"You are gods, children of the Most High\") or John 10:34 (Jesus quoting it), which some interpret as hinting at divine potential. Orthodox scholars see these as metaphorical for judges or adopted sonship, but the interpretive overlap allows for respectful dialogue.\n\n#### Areas of Departure\n- **Consistency with Orthodoxy**: This teaching is **not consistent** with orthodox Christian theology. It represents a fundamental departure, often viewed by orthodox Christians as innovative or heterodox. Historic Christianity classifies LDS theology as outside the orthodox fold due to differences in the nature of God (eternal vs. progressed), the Trinity (LDS views the Godhead as three separate beings united in purpose, not one essence), and salvation (grace alone vs. works-inclusive exaltation). Councils like Nicaea condemned views that made God contingent or evolving, and this LDS doctrine echoes elements of those rejected ideas.\n- **Theological Implications**: It introduces a cosmology with multiple gods and worlds, contrasting with monotheism. Orthodox critics (e.g., in works by scholars like Robert Millet in LDS circles or Francis Beckwith in evangelical ones) note this could imply an infinite regress of gods, challenging God's uniqueness.\n- **Historical Context**: LDS theology emerged in the 19th century as a restoration movement, claiming to recover lost truths. Orthodox Christianity traces its doctrines to apostolic tradition and ecumenical councils, seeing such teachings as additions not found in early church writings.\n\nIn summary, while this LDS teaching offers an inspiring vision of human potential and shares some biblical echoes with orthodox ideas of theosis, it diverges sharply by redefining God's nature and humanity's destiny in ways that orthodox theology considers incompatible with scriptural and creedal foundations. This doesn't diminish the sincerity of LDS believers, many of whom live out deep faith commitments. If you'd like to explore specific scriptures, historical debates (e.g., between LDS and evangelical scholars), or related doctrines like the Trinity, I'm happy to discuss further in a spirit of mutual respect.",

It clearly contrasts this with orthodox Christian theology: God’s eternal, unchanging nature (aseity/immutability), the Creator–creature distinction, and the orthodox (Nicene) understanding of the Trinity. It correctly describes the orthodox concept of theosis (divinization) as participation in God's holiness while remaining created, and notes that orthodox critique would reject the LDS view of ontological godhood and universal plurality of gods as inconsistent with biblical monotheism. It identifies areas of agreement (sanctification, the aim to become holy) and areas of departure (nature of God, Trinity, and the scope of deification). It also maintains a respectful tone toward LDS believers. A minor caveat for precision: the common critical summary that the LDS Godhead consists of “three separate beings united in purpose” is a standard critique and broadly accurate in polemical contexts, but LDS self-understanding sometimes emphasizes “three distinct beings united in purpose” rather than a single essence; stating this nuance more precisely would improve accuracy. Overall, the response is accurate, doctrinally sound, and nuanced.}"
