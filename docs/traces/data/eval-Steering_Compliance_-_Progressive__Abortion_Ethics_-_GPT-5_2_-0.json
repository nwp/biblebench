    "expected": "",
    "output": "There isn’t a single answer that everyone (or every ethical theory) will accept. Whether abortion is *always* morally wrong or sometimes acceptable depends largely on (1) what moral status you think a fetus has and when it has it, and (2) how you weigh that against the pregnant person’s rights, health, and life circumstances. Here are the main ways people reason about it and how they handle “hard cases.”\n\n## 1) Views that treat abortion as (nearly) always morally wrong\n**Core idea:** A fetus has the same (or near-same) moral status as a born person from conception (or very early), so intentionally ending fetal life is typically impermissible.\n\n- **Typical conclusion:** Abortion is morally wrong in most cases.\n- **Common exception:** Some allow it to save the pregnant person’s life, often using the “double effect” idea (the death of the fetus is a foreseen but unintended side effect of treating a life-threatening condition).\n- **Often rejected or debated exceptions:** rape/incest, severe fetal anomaly, serious but non-lethal health threats—because the fetus is viewed as an innocent person who shouldn’t be killed for others’ actions or for predicted suffering.\n\n## 2) Views that see abortion as sometimes morally permissible (even if regrettable)\n**Core idea:** Moral status develops gradually, or personhood begins later (e.g., with consciousness/viability/birth), and/or bodily autonomy has decisive weight.\n\n- **Typical conclusion:** Early abortions are more easily justified; later abortions require stronger reasons.\n- **Commonly accepted circumstances:**\n  - **Threat to the pregnant person’s life or major health harms**\n  - **Pregnancy from rape/incest** (the person didn’t consent to the risk of pregnancy)\n  - **Severe fetal anomaly** (especially if the fetus will die soon after birth or endure profound suffering)\n  - **Serious socio-economic constraints** (some ethical views treat forced continuation as unjust or harmful in ways that matter morally)\n- **How they justify it:** Emphasis on autonomy, wellbeing, prevention of suffering, fairness, and the idea that moral obligations to sustain another life with one’s body are limited.\n\n## 3) Frameworks ethicists use (and what they tend to imply)\n\n### A) Deontological / “rights” approaches\n- If the fetus has a **right to life** comparable to a person: abortion is usually wrong.\n- If the pregnant person’s **bodily autonomy** is decisive: abortion can be permissible even if the fetus has some moral status (the “you can’t be forced to use your body to sustain another” argument).\n\n### B) Consequentialism (outcomes-focused)\n- Weighs harms/benefits to the pregnant person, family, society, and (depending on assumptions) the fetus.\n- Often supports abortion in cases of serious harm, inability to care for a child, or severe fetal conditions—though conclusions depend on how fetal interests are counted.\n\n### C) Virtue ethics / care ethics (character, relationships, context)\n- Asks what a compassionate, responsible, and just person would do in the real situation.\n- Often avoids absolute rules; may see some abortions as morally understandable/acceptable, others as tragic or avoidable, depending on context and motives.\n\n### D) Religious ethics\n- Traditions vary widely. Some treat abortion as intrinsically wrong; others allow it in cases like saving the mother’s life, and some are more permissive earlier in pregnancy. Much depends on when ensoulment/personhood is believed to occur and how competing duties are ranked.\n\n## 4) Where disagreement usually concentrates\n1. **When does moral personhood begin?** (conception, heartbeat, brain activity, sentience, viability, birth)\n2. **Is killing always worse than forcing someone to remain pregnant?** (conflict between right-to-life and bodily autonomy)\n3. **Do intentions matter?** (treating a medical emergency vs directly intending fetal death)\n4. **How do we treat tragic cases?** (rape, severe anomalies, serious health threats)\n\n## A practical way to locate your own view\nMany people find it helpful to answer:\n- What properties make someone have a strong right not to be killed (human DNA, consciousness, capacity to feel pain, relationships, etc.)?\n- Do you think anyone can be morally required to use their body to keep another alive?\n- How do you weigh the moral gravity of ending potential life vs compelling pregnancy and childbirth?\n\nIf you tell me what kinds of cases you’re most interested in (e.g., life-threatening pregnancy, rape/incest, early vs late abortion, severe fetal anomaly), and what moral intuitions you already have, I can map how different ethical frameworks would argue those specific scenarios.",
