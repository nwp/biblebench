          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately captures the core idea that parables reveal truth to the receptive and conceal it from the unreceptive, and that they use relatable, everyday imagery. It aligns with key biblical themes (revelation to the seeker versus concealment from the hard-hearted) and is consistent with historic orthodoxy. However, it would be stronger with explicit references to the relevant passages (Matt 13, Mark 4, Luke 8) and a clearer articulation of the nuanced dynamic: revelation to insiders vs. concealment to outsiders, the invitation to interpret, and the prophetic/kingdom-mystery context. The current phrasing is accurate but somewhat terse and could be read as a more deterministic concealment rather than a heart-condition-based reality explained by Jesus in the gospels."
