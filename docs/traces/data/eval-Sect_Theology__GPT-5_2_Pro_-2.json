    "input": "An LDS member explains that salvation requires faith in Christ plus baptism, temple ordinances, and ongoing obedience. Is this the biblical gospel?",
    "expected": "This teaching conflicts with the orthodox Christian doctrine of salvation by grace through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28). While orthodox Christianity acknowledges that genuine faith produces good works and obedience (James 2:17), it teaches that salvation is received as a free gift through faith in Christ's finished work, not earned through human effort or religious rituals. The LDS concept of exaltation through temple ordinances (endowment, celestial marriage, etc.) adds requirements beyond what Scripture teaches and represents a works-based salvation system that contradicts the biblical gospel of grace.",
    "output": "### 1) What the LDS member is saying (in LDS terms)\nLatter-day Saints typically use **“salvation”** in more than one sense:\n\n- **General salvation**: through Christ, *all* will be resurrected (a universal gift of grace).\n- **Exaltation / eternal life** (the highest destiny): requires **faith in Christ**, **repentance**, **baptism**, **receiving the Holy Ghost**, and then **temple ordinances** (endowment, sealing), plus **enduring in covenant obedience**.\n\nSo the LDS statement—“faith in Christ plus baptism, temple ordinances, and ongoing obedience”—is essentially describing the LDS path of **covenant keeping leading to exaltation**, not merely belief in Jesus.\n\n### 2) How this relates to the biblical gospel (what “gospel” is in Scripture)\nIn the New Testament, the “gospel” is centrally the announcement that **Jesus Christ died for our sins and rose again**, and that sinners are reconciled to God through him:\n\n- **1 Corinthians 15:1–4** summarizes the gospel as Christ’s death for sins, burial, and resurrection.\n- The standard apostolic response is **repentance and faith** (e.g., Mark 1:15; Acts 16:31).\n- Scripture also presents **baptism** as commanded for disciples and closely tied to conversion (Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38).\n\nWhere Christians differ is *how* baptism relates to salvation (sign, instrument, or covenant entry), and *how* obedience relates to salvation (fruit/evidence vs. meritorious condition).\n\n### 3) Areas of agreement with orthodox Christianity\nThere are important overlaps with historic Christianity:\n\n- **Faith in Christ is necessary.** Orthodox Christianity agrees that salvation is in Christ alone (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).\n- **Baptism is commanded and significant.** Many orthodox Christians (especially Catholic/Orthodox) would affirm baptism as a real means of grace, not a mere symbol (John 3:5; Acts 2:38; 1 Peter 3:21—interpreted in various ways).\n- **Ongoing obedience matters.** The New Testament calls believers to holiness and perseverance (John 14:15; Hebrews 12:14; James 2:14–26). Orthodox Christianity teaches that saving faith is living and fruitful, not barren.\n\nSo if the LDS member means: “Christ saves, baptism is part of discipleship, and genuine faith produces obedience,” that resembles biblical themes.\n\n### 4) Key departures from the biblical gospel as understood by historic (Nicene) Christianity\nThe major points of tension are not simply “faith vs. obedience,” but **what is being made a requirement for salvation**, and **what kind of salvation is in view**.\n\n#### A) “Faith *plus* ordinances” as *conditions* can conflict with the apostolic contrast between grace and works\nThe New Testament strongly warns against treating human works/rites as what *secures* right standing before God:\n\n- **Ephesians 2:8–9**: saved by grace through faith, “not a result of works.”\n- **Romans 3–5; Galatians 2–3**: justification is not earned by “works of the law.”\n\nCatholic and Orthodox Christians would respond: “We don’t mean we *earn* salvation; grace enables our response, and sacraments are God’s means.” That is still within historic orthodoxy.\n\nBut the LDS framing often sounds closer to: *Christ’s grace + our covenant performance and required ordinances = qualifying for the highest salvation.* If temple rites and ongoing obedience function as **necessary qualifiers** in a way that makes final acceptance depend on meeting covenant requirements, many Christians (especially Protestants) see that as departing from Paul’s insistence that justification is grounded in Christ’s finished work, received by faith.\n\nA helpful distinction in orthodox theology is:\n- **Justification**: God’s gracious declaration that the sinner is righteous in Christ.\n- **Sanctification**: the lifelong transformation that follows.\n\nOrthodoxy (including Catholic/Orthodox, though expressed differently than Protestants) insists that our transformation and obedience are the **fruit** of grace, not an independent “add-on” that completes Christ’s saving work.\n\n#### B) Temple ordinances as required saving ordinances are not taught as part of the New Testament gospel\nThe New Testament does not present **temple endowments, sealings, or proxy rites** as ordinances required for salvation.\n\n- Christians do see **temple imagery** fulfilled in Christ (John 2:19–21) and the church as God’s temple (1 Corinthians 3:16).\n- But the apostolic preaching to Jews and Gentiles centers on **Christ, repentance, faith, baptism, and life in the Spirit**, not temple rituals as saving requirements.\n\nSo the specific LDS temple system is a substantial departure from what the New Testament identifies as the saving message and the church’s sacramental life.\n\n#### C) Broader doctrinal differences matter because “the gospel” is tied to *which* God and *which* Christ is preached\nEven if two groups use similar words (Jesus, salvation, grace), historic Christianity has understood the gospel to be inseparable from core doctrines summarized in the creeds (e.g., the Trinity and the eternal Sonship of Christ). LDS theology differs significantly from Nicene trinitarianism and classical theism. For many orthodox Christians, that means the LDS message is not simply “a different view of requirements,” but a different theological framework.\n\n### 5) So, is it “the biblical gospel”?\n- **If “biblical gospel” means the apostolic message that sinners are reconciled to God solely because of Christ’s death and resurrection, received by faith, with good works as the result of salvation**, then the LDS “faith + temple ordinances + ongoing obedience” formulation is **not the biblical gospel in the historic Christian sense**, because it adds required rites and covenant-keeping as conditions for attaining the fullest saving outcome.\n- **If “biblical gospel” is taken more loosely to include baptism and the call to obedience as part of Christian discipleship**, then parts of the LDS statement echo biblical language—but the LDS inclusion of **temple ordinances as necessary** and its overall soteriological structure still represents a notable departure from how the New Testament frames the gospel and from orthodox Christian doctrine.\n\nIn short: orthodox Christianity affirms **faith, baptism, and obedience** in some form, but it does **not** treat **temple ordinances** as required saving rites, and it is careful to guard that salvation rests entirely on **Christ’s finished work and God’s grace**, not on meeting additional covenant performances to qualify for the highest saving status.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately distinguishes LDS soteriology (faith in Christ plus ordinances and covenant obedience leading to exaltation) from the biblical gospel (salvation by grace through faith in Christ, with baptism and obedience as appropriate, but not temple rites as saving requirements). It correctly emphasizes the NT focus on Christ’s finished work, justification by faith, and subsequent sanctification. It notes temple ordinances as a non-biblical saving requirement and discusses the distinction between general salvation and exaltation, as well as the ongoing differences in how God, Christ, and the Spirit are viewed compared to Nicene orthodoxy. It also uses standard scriptural anchors (e.g., Eph 2:8–9; Rom 3, Gal 2–3; Matt 28:19; Acts 2:38) and acknowledges nuances about baptism’s role and the nature of obedience. Minor room for refinement exists (e.g., acknowledging broader Protestant concerns about “faith plus works” without misrepresenting Catholic/Orthodox positions, and further clarifying LDS theological specifics), but overall the assessment is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."
