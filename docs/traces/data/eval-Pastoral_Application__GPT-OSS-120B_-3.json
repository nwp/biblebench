    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "**Dear Friend,**\n\nFirst, know that my heart is with you in this terrible loss. The pain of losing a child is a grief that no one should have to bear, and no words can ever fully erase the hollow that his or her absence leaves. I am grateful that you have come to the Lord’s table and shared this raw, honest question. The honesty of your sorrow is a prayer in itself, and it is the very place where God meets us in our deepest need.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Acknowledge the Reality of the Pain\n\n> **“The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.”**  \n> *Psalm 34:18 (NIV)*\n\nYou are crushed. It is okay to feel angry, confused, or empty. Grief is not a sin; it is a natural response to the loss of someone we love. The Bible never pretended that a believer’s life would be free from sorrow (John 16:33). Even Jesus wept at Lazarus’ tomb (John 11:35). So your tears are not a sign of weak faith—they are a sign of a heart that loved deeply.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What “God’s Will” Really Means\n\nWhen people say, “It’s God’s will,” they often mean one of two things:\n\n1. **God ordains every specific event** – *that a particular accident happened exactly as it did.*  \n2. **God’s sovereign purpose can bring good out of even the worst situations** – *that He can work through the tragedy for a greater good.*\n\nThe biblical view leans toward the second. Scripture teaches that God is sovereign (Isaiah 55:8‑9) **and** that He works within a fallen, broken world where sin, decay, and death are real consequences (Romans 5:12). The accident itself was a result of a fallen creation—not something God “willed” as a happy choice. Yet God never abandons us in those moments; He can bring comfort, transformation, and hope out of the wreckage.\n\n> **“And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”**  \n> *Romans 8:28 (NIV)*\n\nThe “good” may not be the tragedy itself—it is the fruit that God can produce in and through us: deeper compassion for other grieving families, a more honest reliance on Him, a witness to the world of His sustaining power, and ultimately, the promise of eternal reunion.\n\n---\n\n### 3. The Mystery of Suffering\n\nThe Bible does not pretend to have a complete formula for *why* particular tragedies happen. Even the most faithful—a man of great faith like Abraham—experienced sorrow and loss (Genesis 23). The Book of Job confronts the painfully simple reality that sometimes “the reasons are beyond our understanding” (Job 38‑41). In those moments we are invited to:\n\n1. **Cling to God’s character**—He is loving, just, and faithful.  \n2. **Lament before Him**—Psalm 42, Lamentations, and the Psalms of the Cross are the Bible’s models for honest sorrow.  \n3. **Trust the larger narrative**—God’s redemptive plan (Christ’s death and resurrection) assures us that death is not the final word.\n\n> **“He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more… for the former things have passed away.”**  \n> *Revelation 21:4 (NIV)*\n\nIn Christ, death has been defeated. While our bodies return to dust, the soul, created in the image of God, holds the promise of eternal life (John 3:16; 1 Cor 15:51‑57). Our grief is already being poured into the hope of a glorious reunion beyond this life.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Practical Steps for Healing\n\n1. **Allow Yourself to Grieve**  \n   - Cry, shout, write, or sit in silence—whatever expresses the pain.  \n   - Keep a journal of memories and prayers; this can become a treasured testimony of your child's life.\n\n2. **Lean on a Faith Community**  \n   - Ask a trusted pastor or elder to pray with you regularly.  \n   - Invite friends to bring meals, sit with you, or simply be present. The early church “carried each other's burdens” (Gal 6:2).\n\n3. **Seek Professional Help**  \n   - Grief counselors, pastoral care teams, or Christian therapists can give tools for processing trauma, especially if intrusive thoughts, insomnia, or depression set in.\n\n4. **Create a Living Memorial**  \n   - Plant a tree, fund a scholarship, or start a charitable project in your child’s name. This gives tangible expression to the “good” that can grow from grief (Romans 8:28).\n\n5. **Regularly Meditate on Scripture**  \n   - Verses such as Psalm 23, Isaiah 41:10, Matthew 5:4, and 2 Cor 1:3‑4 remind us of God’s presence and comfort.\n\n6. **Prayerful Surrender**  \n   - You may not understand why this happened, but you can invite God into the pain:  \n     > “Lord, I don’t understand, but I trust that You are near. I lay my child’s life into Your loving hands and ask You to use my sorrow for Your glory.”\n\n---\n\n### 5. A Promise of Hope\n\nThe ultimate answer to “How can a loving God will my child’s death?” is found in the cross and the resurrection. The very *most* loving act God could ever demonstrate was to enter our broken world, suffer the crushing weight of sin, and die in place of us (John 19). In that act He showed that Death itself is not the end.\n\n> **“For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers… will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”**  \n> *Romans 8:38‑39 (NIV)*\n\nYour child now rests in that inexhaustible love. As you walk this painful road, the Holy Spirit promises to be your Comforter (John 14:26) and to give you “peace that surpasses all understanding” (Philippians 4:7). That peace does not erase the sorrow, but it steadies the heart while we await the day when “God will wipe away every tear” (Rev 21:4).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Closing Prayer\n\n> **Gracious Father,**  \n> We come before You with broken hearts, confessing our confusion and our grief. We ask that You would draw near to this beloved child’s parent, wrapping them in Your unfailing love. May the truth that You are sovereign yet tender comfort them, and may Your Holy Spirit bring a peace that steadies their soul. Help us, as a church, to be a refuge of compassion, bearing one another’s burdens and pointing always to the hope found in Christ’s resurrection. Keep the memory of this precious life alive in love, and may the promise of eternity bring a future beyond all pain. In Jesus’ holy name, **Amen.**\n\n---\n\n**Dear friend,** you are not alone. God sees your tears, He knows the depth of your pain, and He is with you—in the quiet of the night, in the gentle whisper of a prayer, and in the promise of a day when mourning will be turned into everlasting joy. May His love be the anchor that holds you steady as you walk forward, blessed and sustained by His grace. If you need anything—someone to pray with you, a listening ear, or help finding a counselor—please let me know. I am here for you. \n\nWith compassion and hope,  \n*Pastor [Name]*.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response is largely faithful to biblical teaching and historic Christian orthodoxy. It correctly: (1) affirms God’s sovereignty while distinguishing between what God wills and what He allows, (2) rejects the idea that God specifically designs every tragedy as a good, and (3) emphasizes that God can bring good and redemptive fruit from suffering (Romans 8:28), while not trivializing grief, (4) grounds its claims in Scripture (Ps 34:18; John 11:35; Rom 8:28; Revelation 21:4; Rom 8:38-39; John 3:16; 1 Cor 15:51-57; Gal 6:2; Ps 23; Isa 41:10; Matt 5:4; etc.), (5) acknowledges the mystery of suffering and the limitations of human understanding (Job), and (6) offers concrete pastoral steps for healing. It also rightly points to the cross and resurrection as the ultimate answer to suffering and death, and encourages lament, prayer, community, and grief support. Potential refinements (minor): a more precise theological formulation could explicitly name the classic distinction between permissive/decretive will (or antecedent/sancrosanct will) to avoid any impression of a single-sentence dichotomy about “God’s will” and to avoid overgeneralizing how people use that phrase. A small factual slip is the brief reference to Genesis 23 as Abraham’s personal sorrow (the chapter actually depicts Abraham mourning Sarah’s death; the point is still biblically sound). Also, some phrasing could be tightened (e.g., Job 38–41 is God’s speech to Job about limits of human understanding; the gist is accurate). Overall, the answer is biblically literate, pastorally robust, and theologically sound."
