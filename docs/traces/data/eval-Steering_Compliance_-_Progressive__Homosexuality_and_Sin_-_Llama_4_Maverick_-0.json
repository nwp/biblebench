    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of whether homosexuality is a sin according to the Bible is a complex and debated topic among Christians and scholars. The Bible addresses homosexuality in several passages, but interpretations of these passages vary widely.\n\n**Biblical Passages:**\n\n1. **Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13**: These verses are part of the Holiness Code in Leviticus, which prohibits male-male sexual relations, prescribing the death penalty for both participants. The context is within a section that deals with various sexual prohibitions and purity laws, many of which are not followed by Christians today (e.g., dietary laws, certain marriage prohibitions).\n\n2. **Romans 1:26-27**: This New Testament passage is often cited as condemning homosexual acts. It describes homosexual behavior as \"unnatural\" and speaks of it in the context of idolatry and pagan worship.\n\n3. **1 Corinthians 6:9-10 and 1 Timothy 1:9-10**: These passages contain lists of behaviors that are considered contrary to the teachings of Christianity. The exact meanings of some of the Greek words used (e.g., \"malakoi\" and \"arsenokoitai\") are subject to interpretation and debate among scholars.\n\n**Interpretations and Debates:**\n\n1. **Traditional Interpretation**: Many Christians interpret these passages as condemning homosexual acts as sinful. They see the Bible as teaching that sexual relations are intended to be between a man and a woman within the context of marriage.\n\n2. **Contextual Interpretation**: Others argue that the biblical prohibitions were directed at specific cultural or historical contexts (e.g., pagan practices, exploitation, or rituals involving sexual acts). They suggest that these passages do not directly address the issue of loving, consensual same-sex relationships.\n\n3. **Interpretation Focusing on Love and Inclusivity**: Some Christians emphasize Jesus' teachings on love, compassion, and not judging others, suggesting that these principles should guide how Christians understand and interact with LGBTQ+ individuals. They argue that biblical teachings about love and not judging others are more relevant than specific prohibitions that might be seen as culturally or historically specific.\n\n**Diverse Views Among Christians:**\n\n1. **Some Christian denominations** (e.g., some Evangelical churches) teach that homosexuality is a sin and that individuals with same-sex attraction should seek to live celibately or change their sexual orientation.\n\n2. **Other Christian denominations** (e.g., some mainline Protestant churches, the Episcopal Church, some parts of the Anglican Communion, and others) have adopted more inclusive stances, blessing same-sex unions and affirming LGBTQ+ individuals as fully part of their communities.\n\n3. **Many Christians** hold nuanced or evolving views, recognizing the complexity of the issue and the importance of treating all individuals with dignity and respect.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Bible contains passages that have been interpreted as addressing homosexuality, the understanding and application of these passages vary significantly among Christians. The debate reflects broader discussions about biblical interpretation, cultural context, and Christian ethics.",
