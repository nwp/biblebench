    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "The doctrine of the **Resurrection of the Body** is a foundational and distinctive tenet of Christian theology, affirming that at the end of the age, God will miraculously raise from the dead the physical bodies of all believers in Christ, transforming them into glorious, immortal, and perfect states suited for eternal life in the New Creation. It stands in contrast to purely spiritualized concepts of the afterlife common in some ancient and modern worldviews.\n\nHere is a systematic explanation grounded in Scripture and Christian tradition:\n\n1.  **Biblical Foundation:**\n    *   **Old Testament:** While less explicit than the New Testament, the concept is present. Key passages include:\n        *   **Daniel 12:2:** \"Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.\" (Implies a bodily awakening).\n        *   **Isaiah 25:8:** \"He will swallow up death forever... The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears from all faces.\" (Context suggests the removal of death's finality).\n        *   **Isaiah 26:19:** \"But your dead will live, Lord; their bodies will rise—let those in the dust awake and shout for joy.\"\n        *   **Ezekiel 37:1-14:** The vision of the valley of dry bones, symbolizing the restoration of Israel, powerfully illustrates God's power to reassemble and revitalize lifeless bodies (\"Prophesy to these bones... they will come to life!\").\n    *   **New Testament:** The doctrine is central, especially concerning Christ's own resurrection and its implications for believers.\n        *   **Jesus' Resurrection:** The Gospels meticulously detail Jesus' physical resurrection (Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, John 20-21), emphasizing his tangible body that could be touched, eat, and bear wounds. This is the \"firstfruits\" (1 Cor. 15:20) and pattern for believers.\n        *   **Paul's Teaching (1 Corinthians 15):** This chapter is the most systematic exposition:\n            *   The body that is sown (buried) is the same body that is raised, though transformed (v. 35-44).\n            *   The resurrection body is \"imperishable,\" \"glorious,\" \"powerful,\" \"spiritual\" (v. 42-44).\n            *   Believers will bear the \"image of the heavenly man\" (Christ) (v. 49).\n            *   The resurrection is essential to the Christian hope: \"If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all people\" (v. 19).\n        *   **General Resurrection:** Jesus teaches of a future resurrection of *all* people (John 5:28-29). Believers' resurrection occurs at Christ's return (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:51-52).\n        *   **Promise to Believers:** \"He who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus\" (2 Corinthians 4:14). \"Our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body\" (Philippians 3:20-21).\n\n2.  **Nature of the Resurrection Body:**\n    *   **Continuity and Identity:** It is the *same* body that lived on earth, reconstituted by God. It possesses personal identity and continuity with the pre-resurrection life.\n    *   **Transformation, Not Replacement:** The core material is not discarded but miraculously transformed. Paul's analogy of a seed sown and then growing into a different kind of body (1 Cor. 15:35-38) emphasizes this.\n    *   **Perfection and Incorruptibility:** The resurrection body is \"imperishable\" (1 Cor. 15:42) – free from disease, decay, aging, and death. It is \"glorious\" and \"powerful\" (v. 43).\n    *   **Suitability for Eternal Life:** It is perfectly adapted for life in the renewed, perfect creation (the New Heavens and New Earth). It is a \"spiritual body\" (1 Cor. 15:44), not meaning immaterial, but suited for the spiritual realm, though still physical and tangible (as evidenced by Jesus' post-resurrection appearances).\n    *   **Glorious and Christlike:** Believers will bear the \"image of the heavenly man\" (1 Cor. 15:49) – resembling Christ's own glorious resurrection body (Philippians 3:21). It is a body fit for eternal fellowship with God and others.\n\n3.  **Theological Significance:**\n    *   **Victory Over Death:** The resurrection is God's final victory over the last enemy, death (1 Cor. 15:26, 54-57). Christ's resurrection guarantees and initiates this victory for believers.\n    *   **Affirmation of Creation:** It decisively counters Gnostic and Platonic dualisms that devalue the physical body and material creation. Christianity affirms that God created the physical world *good* and will redeem and restore it, including our physical bodies.\n    *   **Completeness of Salvation:** Salvation is not merely the rescue of a soul from the body, but the redemption and transformation of the *whole person* – body, soul, and spirit. The resurrection ensures the final and complete state of blessedness for the believer.\n    *   **Eschatological Hope:** It is the cornerstone of the Christian hope for the future. It provides comfort in the face of death (1 Thess. 4:13-14) and motivates holy living (1 Cor. 15:32-34).\n    *   **Foundation of the New Creation:** The resurrection of the body is intrinsically linked to the renewal of all creation (Romans 8:18-25). The redeemed universe will include redeemed humanity in redeemed physical bodies.\n\n4.  **Distinction from Related Concepts:**\n    *   **Resuscitation:** This is not mere resuscitation to the same mortal, corruptible life (like Lazarus). It is a transformation into an eternal, incorruptible state.\n    *   **Reincarnation:** This is fundamentally different. Reincarnation involves the soul (or some essence) entering a *new* physical body in a *new* life, often with no guarantee of progress. The resurrection is the reuniting and transforming of *one's own specific body* with one's soul/spirit for *eternal life*.\n    *   **Soul Sleep / Annihilationism:** These views deny conscious existence after death until a future resurrection. The doctrine affirms conscious existence immediately after death (in a disembodied state for believers) *and* the future resurrection to embodied life. It also denies annihilation, affirming eternal conscious existence for all, either in blessedness or judgment.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body teaches that God, through the victorious work of Jesus Christ, will at the end of the age raise the physical bodies of all believers from the dead. These bodies will be miraculously transformed, retaining their identity but becoming incorruptible, glorious, powerful, and perfectly suited for eternal life in the renewed creation. This resurrection is the final victory over sin, death, and decay, affirming the goodness of God's creation and providing the ultimate hope and completion of salvation for the Christian. It is grounded firmly in the reality of Christ's own bodily resurrection and the promises of Scripture.",

            "Unclear emphasis on continuity vs. transformation: The answer often says the resurrected body is the 'same' body, but 1 Corinthians 15 emphasizes transformation (sown perishable, raised imperishable). The resurrected body is continuous in personal identity but not necessarily the exact same physical matter; phrasing could mislead readers into thinking it is literally the same physical body.",
            "Mark 16:9-20 as a primary witness: While Mark 16 is commonly cited for post-resurrection appearances, the longer finale (16:9-20) is disputed in manuscript evidence. Relying on it as a robust, uniform description of the resurrected body’s appearance can be overstated; the core NT witness to bodily resurrection is not dependent on that disputed ending.",
            "Clarification needed on the 'intermediate state' vs. final resurrection: The response affirms conscious disembodied existence for believers after death, then a bodily resurrection. Some traditions emphasize a more explicit, wait-for-the-resurrection nuance (and some debate about the intermediate state). The text could more clearly distinguish immediate consciousness after death from the final, transformed embodied life."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the response is solid: it aligns with historic Christian teaching on a bodily, transformed resurrection grounded in both Old and New Testament Scripture, highlights continuity and transformation, and emphasizes ultimate victory over death, creation renewal, and the embodied nature of eternal life. The major strengths are its scriptural support (1 Cor 15, John 5, 1 Thess 4, Phil 3, Rom 8, Isa/ Dan/ Ezek passages), its handling of 'spiritual body' language, and its distinctions from resuscitation, reincarnation, and soul-sleep views. The minor issues that prevent a perfect score are primarily terminological and interpretive clarifications (the exact sense of continuity/identity of the body in resurrection; manuscript-critical note on Mark 16; and the need for a precise articulation of intermediate state vs. final resurrection). If these are clarified, the assessment would be at or near 1.0."

          "explanation": "The response presents a robust, orthodox account of the Resurrection of the Body. It consistently treats bodily resurrection as central to Christian eschatology, grounded in key biblical passages (e.g., 1 Corinthians 15; John 5; 1 Thessalonians 4; Philippians 3) and affirmed traditions across Scripture and church teaching. It rightly rejects Gnostic/Platonic dualisms and reincarnation, and it emphasizes continuity of personal identity, transformation of the body, and its suitability for eternal life in the new creation. Minor, non-doctrinal nuances could be clarified: (1) the exact meaning of “spiritual body” in 1 Corinthians 15:44 (emphasizing transformed rather than purely immaterial reality), (2) the nature of the intermediate state between death and resurrection (where some traditions affirm immediate conscious existence and others emphasize variations like soul sleep or purgatorial notions), and (3) the precise timing and sequencing of events (general resurrection, rapture, and Christ’s return) which vary among orthodox interpretations. None of these amount to heresy; they reflect legitimate theological nuance rather than doctrinal error."
