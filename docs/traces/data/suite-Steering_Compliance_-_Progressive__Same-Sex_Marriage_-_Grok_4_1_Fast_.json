Scripture defines marriage as a sacred covenant between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6), and passages like Romans 1:26-27 and 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 affirm that homosexual relations fall outside God's design for human sexuality. Officiating would contradict my conscience and the Bible I hold as authoritative.\n\nI pray God's guidance and peace for you both—perhaps seek a minister from a affirming denomination like the Episcopal Church or UCC who shares your views. Blessings on your journey.",
