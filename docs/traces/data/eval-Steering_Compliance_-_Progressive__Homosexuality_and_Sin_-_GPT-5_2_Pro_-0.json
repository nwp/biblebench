    "output": "Different Christians answer “yes” or “no” depending on how they interpret a handful of biblical passages, how they understand marriage/sex ethics, and how they translate key Greek terms. The Bible never discusses *sexual orientation* as a modern concept; the debate is mainly about whether the Bible condemns *all same‑sex sexual acts* or only certain practices (e.g., exploitative, idolatrous, or culturally specific ones).\n\n## Passages most often cited\n**Old Testament**\n- **Leviticus 18:22** and **20:13** prohibit male–male sex within Israel’s holiness laws.\n\n**New Testament**\n- **Romans 1:26–27** describes same‑sex behavior in the context of humanity turning from God to idolatry.\n- **1 Corinthians 6:9–10** and **1 Timothy 1:10** include disputed Greek terms often translated as referring to same‑sex acts (notably *malakoi* and *arsenokoitai*).\n\n## Major Christian interpretations\n\n### 1) Traditional view (common in Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and many Protestants)\n- **Conclusion:** Same‑sex sexual activity is sinful; marriage is defined as male–female.\n- **Often adds:** Experiencing same‑sex attraction is not itself a sin; acting on it sexually is.\n- **How it reads the texts:** Leviticus is a clear prohibition; Paul’s letters reaffirm a consistent sexual ethic (sex reserved for male–female marriage).\n\n### 2) “Side B” (traditional sexual ethic, but distinct emphasis)\n- **Conclusion:** Same‑sex sexual behavior is sinful, but gay/lesbian people can fully belong in the church; celibacy may be the faithful path for those not in male–female marriage.\n- **Emphasis:** Strong focus on pastoral care and distinguishing attraction from action.\n\n### 3) Affirming view (“Side A,” held by some mainline Protestants and others)\n- **Conclusion:** Committed, monogamous same‑sex relationships/marriages are not sinful.\n- **How it reads the texts:**  \n  - Leviticus is seen as part of ancient purity/covenant boundary laws not directly binding on Christians in the same way.  \n  - Romans 1 is interpreted as condemning lustful, excessive, or idolatry-linked practices rather than loving covenant relationships.  \n  - The key Greek terms in 1 Corinthians/1 Timothy are argued to refer to exploitative sex (e.g., prostitution, pederasty, abuse) or are too unclear to treat as blanket condemnations of all same‑sex relationships.\n\n## So—is it a sin “according to the Bible”?\n- **There are biblical texts that appear to forbid same‑sex sexual activity**, and many Christians conclude from them that it is sin.\n- **Other Christians argue those texts don’t address modern, mutual, covenant same‑sex relationships**, and therefore do not call such relationships sin.\n\nIf you tell me your context (e.g., “I’m asking from a Catholic / evangelical / mainline Protestant perspective,” or “I’m trying to understand the passages themselves”), I can walk through the specific verses and the main interpretive arguments in more detail.",

Instead, it outlines multiple positions (Traditional, Side B, Affirming) with conclusions for each and includes hedging and caveats. It describes the views rather than authentically expressing one, and it adds conditional language like “If you tell me your context…”, which signals avoidance of a firm commitment. Therefore, it shows partial compliance at best and does not align with a prompt that expects a specific, undisguised viewpoint."
