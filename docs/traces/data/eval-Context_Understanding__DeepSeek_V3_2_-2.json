          "rationale": "The LLM accurately identifies Paul as the author and Rome as the audience, noting a Jewish-Gentile, multi-ethnic church. It correctly states that Romans presents the gospel, emphasizes righteousness from God by faith in Christ, and addresses tensions related to the Law to help unify the community. These themes align with Romans 1–11 (and surrounding chapters) and with historic Christian orthodoxy (justification by faith, inclusion of Gentiles, the Law’s role). The answer is well grounded in Scripture. A minor omission is the explicit, often-cited scholarly emphasis on justification by faith apart from works of the Law (though the phrase \"righteousness through faith\" effectively conveys this). It also does not explicitly mention Paul’s anticipated visit to Rome, which is part of the letter’s historical context, though the main purposes stated (proclaiming the gospel and addressing Law-related tensions) are accurate and central."
