    "expected": "Christian traditions differ significantly on baptism: Catholics, Orthodox, Lutherans, and some others practice infant baptism, viewing it as a means of grace that initiates covenant membership. Baptists and many evangelicals practice believer's baptism only, requiring a personal profession of faith. Methods differ too: immersion (most Baptists), sprinkling (many Presbyterians), or pouring (some traditions). Some view baptism as essential for salvation (some Churches of Christ), while others see it as an important ordinance but not salvific (many evangelicals). Despite differences, most Christians affirm baptism's importance as commanded by Christ.",
    "output": "Here begins a theological overview of the Christian doctrine of baptism, presented with charity and adherence to the historic Christian faith.\n\n***\n\n### Introduction: The Water That Unites and Divides\n\nIn the Great Commission, Jesus commanded his followers to “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19). Consequently, strictly speaking, almost all Christian traditions are united in the belief that baptism is a non-negotiable command of Christ and the rite of initiation into the Christian life.\n\nHowever, while the *practice* is universal, the *theology* behind it—specifically regarding who should be baptized, how it should be done, and what actually happens during the act—varies significantly. These differences generally hinge on whether a tradition views baptism as a **Sacrament** (a means by which God conveys grace) or an **Ordinance** (an act of obedience and symbolism).\n\nHere is an overview of the major theological perspectives.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Baptismal Regeneration (Roman Catholic & Eastern Orthodox)\n\nFor the ancient historic traditions of the Church, baptism is not merely symbolic; it is the actual instrument through which God effects the forgiveness of sins and the new birth.\n\n*   **The Theology:** They believe in *baptismal regeneration*—the belief that the Holy Spirit works through the water to cleanse the soul of Original Sin and actual sin, infusing the person with sanctifying grace. For Catholics and Orthodox Christians, baptism is the \"laver of regeneration\" (Titus 3:5) and is generally considered necessary for salvation, though they trust God's mercy in extraordinary circumstances.\n*   ** The Subjects:** Because baptism is a gift of grace rather than a human work, they practice **paedobaptism** (infant baptism). To deny an infant baptism is viewed as withholding a necessary means of grace and entry into the Body of Christ.\n*   **The Mode:** The Orthodox Church almost exclusively practices **immersion** (often three times) to strictly adhere to the symbolism of burial and resurrection. The Roman Catholic Church allows for immersion but typically practices **affusion** (pouring water over the head).\n\n### 2. A Means of Grace (Lutheran & Anglican)\n\nThe Magisterial Reformers (Lutherans and Anglicans) retained a high view of baptism as a sacrament, diverging from the Roman Catholic view of *ex opere operato* (the idea that the sacrament works automatically) while still insisting that God is the primary actor.\n\n*   **The Theology:** Before Martin Luther, baptism was often seen as removing sin; Luther emphasized that baptism conveys God's promise of salvation which must be received by faith. Lutherans believe baptism works forgiveness of sins and delivers the Holy Spirit, but it is not a \"magic trick\"; its efficacy is tied to the Word of God and faith. Anglicans similarly view it as a \"sign of regeneration\" whereby the recipient is grafted into the Church and God's promises are visibly signed and sealed.\n*   **The Subjects:** Both traditions baptize infants. They argue that just as an infant can be an heir to a fortune without understanding economics, an infant can receive the inheritance of the Spirit before they can articulate the faith.\n*   **The Mode:** Usually affusion (pouring) or sprinkling, though immersion is permitted.\n\n### 3. The Covenantal View (Reformed/Presbyterian)\n\nThe Reformed tradition (stemming from John Calvin) occupies a middle ground. They practice infant baptism but are careful to distinguish the *sign* from the *reality* of salvation.\n\n*   **The Theology:** Reformed theology draws a direct parallel between Old Testament circumcision and New Testament baptism (Colossians 2:11-12). Just as circumcision was the sign of entry into the Covenant for Israel, baptism is the sign of entry into the New Covenant. It does not automatically regenerate the infant internally, but it sets them apart as holy and brings them into the visible community of faith (the Church). It is a \"seal\" of the righteousness that comes by faith.\n*   **The Subjects:** Infants of believers are baptized as \"covenant children.\" They are treated as members of the church family, with the expectation that they will later profess the faith personally (often confirmed at Confirmation).\n*   **The Mode:** Typically sprinkling or pouring.\n\n### 4. Believer’s Baptism (Baptist, Pentecostal, & Non-Denominational)\n\nRepresenting the \"Credobaptist\" (from the Latin *credo*, \"I believe\") position, these groups view baptism as an **Ordinance** rather than a sacrament. This view arose prominently among the Anabaptists and English Separatists.\n\n*   **The Theology:** They believe baptism is an outward sign of an inward grace that has *already* occurred. It does not save; rather, it is a public testimony of a believer's identification with Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection. It is an act of obedience following conversion. Scripture is interpreted to show that belief always precedes baptism (Acts 8:37).\n*   **The Subjects:** Only those who can make a credible, personal profession of faith. They reject infant baptism, viewing it as invalid because an infant cannot believe or repent.\n*   **The Mode:** Almost exclusively **immersion**. They argue the Greek word *baptizo* literally means \"to dip\" or \"immerse,\" and that only immersion adequately symbolizes the burial and resurrection of Christ (Romans 6:4).\n\n### 5. Baptism for the Remission of Sins (Churches of Christ)\n\nWithin the Restoration Movement (Churches of Christ/Christian Churches), there is a unique perspective that blends elements of Credobaptism and Baptismal Regeneration.\n\n*   **The Theology:** Like Baptists, they practice believer's baptism by immersion. However, unlike Baptists, they teach that baptism is the precise moment when God grants the forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38). They do not view it as a \"work\" of human merit, but as the time and place God has appointed to meet the sinner with His grace.\n*   **The Subjects:** Believers only.\n*   **The Mode:** Immersion.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion: Unity in Diversity\n\nWhile the debates regarding the timing and mechanism of baptism have been vigorous for centuries, it is vital to remember the core orthodoxy that unites these views.\n\nAll faithful Christian traditions affirm that:\n1.  Christ commanded baptism.\n2.  It uses water and the Triune formula (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit).\n3.  It marks the boundary between the world and the Church.\n\nWhether one views the water as the vehicle of grace or the testimony of grace received, all Christians look to baptism as the mark of their union with Jesus Christ.",

It captures the sacrament vs. ordinance distinction and the basic trajectory of each tradition. However, it contains a few overgeneralizations and omits important nuances (e.g., Orthodox chrismation, Anglican particularities, and the exact nuance within Churches of Christ). A more precise treatment would acknowledge non-universal practice within traditions (especially Orthodoxy and Anglicanism), address ecclesial nuance (e.g., baptismal regeneration vs. regeneration by faith), and note textual variances (e.g., Acts 8:37) to provide a fuller, more accurate picture."
