    "expected": "Justification by faith is the doctrine that sinners are declared righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus Christ, not by their own works or merit. It is a legal declaration by God where the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, and their sins are forgiven. This justification is received through faith alone (sola fide), by grace alone (sola gratia), based on Christ's finished work alone (solus Christus).",
    "output": "## Justification by Faith – How One Is Declared Righteous Before God  \n\n### 1. What “justification” Means\n\n| Term | Technical sense (theological) | Everyday sense |\n|------|-------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Justification** | A **forensic (legal) declaration** by God that a person is **“righteous”** (i.e., in right standing) before Him. It is **extrinsic** to the believer’s inner moral condition. | “Being made right” or “being acquitted.” |\n\nThe classic language comes from the Greek *δικαίωσις* (*dikaiōsis*), used by Paul (cf. **Rom 3:24**, **Rom 5:1**, **Phil 3:9**). It is not the same as **sanctification**, which is the **intrinsic** process of becoming holy.\n\n### 2. The Biblical Ground‑Zero: The Problem of Sin\n\n* **All have sinned** – **Rom 3:23**: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”  \n* **Sin creates a legal debt** (the penalty of death) – **Rom 6:23**: “For the wages of sin is death.”  \n\nBecause God is holy, He cannot **look** upon sin with impunity (cf. **Hab 1:13**). Hence a divine **reconciliation** is required.\n\n### 3. The Christ‑Centered Solution\n\n1. **Christ’s Righteous Life** – He perfectly fulfilled the Law (cf. **Rom 5:19**).  \n2. **Christ’s Substitutionary Death** – He bore the penalty for sin (cf. **2 Cor 5:21**: “For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin”).  \n3. **Christ’s Resurrection** – Guarantees the believer’s justification (cf. **Rom 4:25**, **1 Cor 15:17**).\n\nThus, **the righteousness of Christ is the basis of justification**. It is **imputed**—credited—to the believer’s account.\n\n### 4. Faith: The Instrument That Receives Christ’s Righteousness\n\n**Definition** – Faith is **personal trust in, assent to, and reliance upon** Christ’s person and work (cf. **Heb 11:1**, **Eph 2:8**). It is not a vague feeling, but a **cognitive‑relational assent** that yields **commitment**.\n\n#### Key New Testament Passages\n\n| Passage | Core Idea |\n|---------|-----------|\n| **Rom 3:21‑22** | “But now the righteousness of God has been manifested… apart from the law, through faith in Jesus Christ.” |\n| **Rom 4:1‑5** | Abraham was justified **by faith**, not by works. Faith is “credited as righteousness.” |\n| **Rom 5:1** | “Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” |\n| **Gal 2:16** | “A person is justified by faith in Jesus Christ, not by works of the law.” |\n| **Eph 2:8‑9** | Faith is a **gift of God**, not a work. |\n| **Phil 3:9** | “Being found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ— the righteousness from God that is by faith.” |\n\n**How Faith Works in the Economy of Salvation**\n\n1. **Reception** – The believer **receives** Christ’s atoning work (His death and resurrection) **by faith**.  \n2. **Imputation** – Because the believer trusts in that work, **God **credits** Christ’s righteousness to the believer’s account** (cf. **2 Cor 5:21**, **Rom 4:3‑5**).  \n3. **Declarative Act** – God **declares** the believer “justified” (declared righteous) **as a legal verdict** (cf. **Rom 5:1**, **Phil 3:9**).  \n\nThus justification is **entirely a work of God**, received **exclusively through faith** in Christ.\n\n### 5. The Role of Grace and the Law\n\n| Concept | Relationship to Justification |\n|---------|--------------------------------|\n| **Grace** | **Unmerited favor**—the very basis of justification. The *gift* is **God’s grace** (cf. **Eph 2:8**). |\n| **Law** | Reveals sin and our inability to be righteous. It **does not** produce justification, but **drives us to Christ** (cf. **Rom 3:20**, **Rom 10:4**). |\n| **Works** | Good deeds are **fruit** of justification, not the **cause** of it (cf. **James 2:24**: “You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.” James is not contradicting Paul; he is pointing out that **genuine faith always produces works**.) |\n\n### 6. Historical Theological Insight\n\n| Thinker | Main Contribution to the Doctrine |\n|---------|------------------------------------|\n| **Augustine** (4th c.) | First to formulate **imputed righteousness** and the “faith‑alone” (non‑merit) principle. |\n| **Martin Luther** (16th c.) | Emphasized **sola fide** (“by faith alone”) against the medieval view that **faith + works** earned justification. |\n| **John Calvin** (16th c.) | Developed the **covenant‑theology** picture: justification as God’s covenantal act, received by **faith** alone. |\n| **Reformed Confessions** (e.g., Westminster, 1646) | Article II: “Justification… is an act of God’s free grace… whereby He pardons all our sins, and accepts us as righteous in His sight, **solely on the ground of Christ’s perfect obedience and sacrifice**… received by faith alone.” |\n| **Catholic Council of Trent** (1546) | While affirming that **faith is necessary**, it teaches that **faith working through charity** is required for justification—highlighting a synergistic view. Modern ecumenical dialogues (e.g., **Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification**, 1999) have found substantial agreement on the core doctrine: **justification by grace through faith in Christ alone**. |\n\n### 7. A Step‑by‑Step Biblical Summary of How One Becomes Righteous\n\n1. **Hear the Gospel** – “Christ died for our sins and rose again” (**1 Cor 15:3‑4**).  \n2. **Believe (have faith)** – Trust that Christ’s death fully atones for your sin (cf. **John 3:16**, **Rom 10:9‑10**).  \n3. **Receive by the Holy Spirit** – The **Spirit applies** Christ’s righteousness to you (cf. **Titus 3:5**, **1 Cor 12:13**).  \n4. **Be Declared Justified** – God pronounces you righteous (cf. **Rom 5:1**, **Gal 3:24‑25**).  \n5. **Yield to Sanctification** – The justified believer, empowered by the Spirit, begins the **process of becoming holy** (cf. **2 Cor 5:17**, **Phil 2:12‑13**).  \n\n### 8. Common Misunderstandings Addressed\n\n| Misunderstanding | Why It Misses the Mark | Biblical Correction |\n|------------------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| **“Faith alone, but we must *prove* it by works.”** | Reduces **faith** to a mere *intention* and makes **works** the basis of salvation. | **James 2:14‑26** shows that **genuine faith** is **alive** and **produces works**; works are **evidence**, not **cause**. |\n| **“Justification is a feeling of being good.”** | Makes justification **subjective**; the biblical doctrine is **objective** and **legal**. | **Romans 3:24**: “justified…by his grace” — a **declared status** before God, independent of inner feelings. |\n| **“If Christ’s righteousness is imputed, why bother with moral growth?”** | Implies **antinomianism** (lawlessness). | **2 Cor 5:17**: “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation” — justification **creates the basis** for **sanctification**. |\n\n### 9. A Concise Theological Definition (for quick reference)\n\n> **Justification** is *the gracious, forensic declaration by God that a sinner, through faith alone in the person and work of Jesus Christ, is counted righteous because Christ’s perfect obedience and atoning death are imputed to the believer.* (cf. **Rom 5:1**, **Gal 2:16**, **Eph 2:8‑9**).\n\n### 10. Practical Implications for Believers\n\n1. **Assurance** – The believer rests in the surety of God’s declaration (cf. **1 John 5:13**).  \n2. **Humility** – All glory belongs to God’s grace; no human merit is claimed (cf. **Eph 2:8‑9**).  \n3. **Obedient Love** – The justified person responds with gratitude, obeying God’s commandments as *the fruit* of faith (cf. **James 2:17**).  \n4. **Unity in the Body** – Since all are justified by the same Christ, division over “works” is overcome (cf. **Eph 2:11‑22**).  \n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\n**Justification by faith** means that, because Christ fully satisfied God’s righteous demands on the cross, God **declares** anyone who **trusts** in Him **righteous**. This declaration is *entirely* a work of divine grace; the human’s part is **faith**—a personal trust in Christ’s atoning work. The believer’s **righteousness** before God is therefore **imputed** (credited) to him, not earned, and becomes the foundation for the ongoing process of **sanctification**.",

It also addresses related doctrines (grace, law, works, and the role of faith) and offers helpful nuance on James 2:24 and historical developments. A minor historical oversimplification about Augustine and ecumenical agreements is noted, but does not undermine the core doctrinal accuracy."

This is a historical claim rather than an explicit doctrinal heresy, but it misstates the tradition’s development.",
            "Overstated ecumenical agreement: The claim that modern ecumenical dialogues have found substantial agreement on “justification by grace through faith in Christ alone” glosses over ongoing theological differences between Catholic and Protestant traditions (e.g., nuances about faith, grace, and cooperation with grace). While common ground exists, full, uniform agreement is not universally held across all interpretive communities."
          ],
          "explanation": "Overall, the response aligns with orthodox Protestant soteriology (justification by faith alone, imputed righteousness, grace, and post-justification sanctification). The main concerns are historical and ecumenical claims that could be misleading rather than doctrinal heresy: (1) Augustine’s role in imputing righteousness and sola fide is contested; (2) the asserted settled ecumenical consensus on justification by faith alone is overly strong. Other than these historical nuances, there are no explicit heresies (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, etc.) present in the content."
