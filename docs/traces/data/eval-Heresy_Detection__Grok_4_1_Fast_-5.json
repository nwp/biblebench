    "input": "A group teaches: 'Salvation comes through secret spiritual knowledge that has been hidden from the masses. Matter is evil, and salvation is escape from the material world into the spiritual realm.' Is this Christian teaching?",
    "expected": "This is Gnosticism, an ancient heresy. It contradicts Christianity in multiple ways: Christianity teaches salvation through faith in Christ's public work (not secret knowledge), affirms the goodness of God's material creation (Genesis 1), and proclaims resurrection of the body (not escape from physicality). Gnosticism was explicitly condemned by early church fathers and the New Testament writings (especially 1 John and Colossians).",
    "output": "**No, this is not orthodox Christian teaching. It represents Gnosticism, a heresy condemned by the early Church.**\n\n### Key Identifiers of Heresy\nThis teaching aligns precisely with core tenets of **Gnosticism** (from Greek *gnōsis*, \"knowledge\"), a diverse set of 2nd-century movements (e.g., Valentinians, Sethians) that the apostolic Fathers and early councils explicitly rejected as incompatible with Christianity. Here's a doctrinal breakdown:\n\n1. **Salvation through \"secret spiritual knowledge\" hidden from the masses**:\n   - **Orthodox Christian view**: Salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ's atoning death and resurrection (Eph. 2:8-9; Rom. 10:9), publicly proclaimed in the Gospel to all nations (Matt. 28:19-20; Acts 1:8). It is not elitist or esoteric—Jesus taught openly, and the apostles wrote epistles for broad dissemination.\n   - **Gnostic heresy**: Salvation requires *gnōsis*, a hidden, mystical insight accessible only to an enlightened spiritual elite (*pneumatikoi*), withheld from the ignorant masses (*hylikoi*). This was refuted by Irenaeus of Lyons (*Against Heresies*, c. 180 AD) as inverting the Gospel into a secret society, denying the sufficiency of Christ's public revelation.\n\n2. **Matter is evil**:\n   - **Orthodox Christian view**: God created all matter \"very good\" (Gen. 1:31), and the Incarnation—God becoming flesh in Jesus (John 1:14)—affirms matter's goodness. Sin corrupts, but creation itself is redeemable (Rom. 8:19-21).\n   - **Gnostic heresy**: Radical dualism posits an evil demiurge (often equated with the OT Yahweh) created the material world as a prison of corrupt matter, trapping divine sparks in bodies. This denies the Creator's benevolence and was condemned at councils like Nicaea (325 AD) for undermining monotheism and the goodness of creation.\n\n3. **Salvation as escape from the material world into the spiritual realm**:\n   - **Orthodox Christian view**: Salvation redeems the whole person—body and soul—for eternal life in a renewed creation, including bodily resurrection (1 Cor. 15:42-44, 51-54; Rev. 21:1-5). Heaven is not flight from earth but its restoration.\n   - **Gnostic heresy**: The goal is liberation of the soul from the body via *gnōsis*, akin to escaping a cosmic prison. No bodily resurrection; matter is irredeemable. Tertullian (*Against Marcion*, c. 207 AD) and others mocked this as docetism (denying Christ's true humanity) and anti-resurrection.\n\n### Historical Condemnation\n- **Early Church Fathers**: Irenaeus, Tertullian, Hippolytus (*Refutation of All Heresies*, c. 225 AD), and Origen exposed Gnosticism's borrowings from Platonism, Judaism, and Christianity while subverting apostolic faith.\n- **Councils**: Echoes persisted in Manichaeism (condemned 388 AD) and Catharism (crusade-era Albigensians, excommunicated 1165 AD at Toulouse).\n- **Creeds**: The Apostles' and Nicene Creeds affirm creation's goodness (\"Maker of heaven and earth\"), incarnation, and resurrection of the flesh—direct anti-Gnostic safeguards.\n\nThis teaching cannot be reconciled with Scripture or the *regula fidei* (rule of faith) preserved by the Church. It promotes spiritual pride, devalues the body, and rejects Christ's lordship over creation. For deeper reading: Irenaeus' *Against Heresies* or Elaine Pagels' *The Gnostic Gospels* (with caution for its sympathetic tone).",

            "Some precision around related terms: the response correctly links Gnosticism to dualism and to secret knowledge, but the connection to docetism as a direct, explicit equivalence is nuanced; early opponents sometimes treated Gnostic tendencies as having docetic elements, but docetism is a distinct heresy that requires careful distinction from Gnosticism as a whole."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the LLM correctly identifies the core features of Gnosticism (secret knowledge, radical dualism/material evil, and salvation as release from matter) and contrasts them with orthodox Christian beliefs (public revelation through Christ, the goodness of creation, and the bodily resurrection). It supports these points with Scripture and notes the historical pattern of condemnation by church Fathers. The response, however, includes some imprecise historical claims (Nicaea’s role in condemning Gnosticism; dates for Manichaeism and Cathar/Albigensian condemnations) that could mislead readers about the historical sequence of doctrinal battles. It would benefit from more precise historical sourcing (e.g., Irenaeus against Gnosticism, the Nicene Creed’s focus on the Son, and the general patristic consensus against Gnostic systems) and a careful handling of related terms like docetism. Nonetheless, the core doctrinal critique aligns well with traditional biblical and historic Christian orthodoxy."
