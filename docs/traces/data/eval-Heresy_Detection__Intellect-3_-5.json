    "input": "A group teaches: 'Salvation comes through secret spiritual knowledge that has been hidden from the masses. Matter is evil, and salvation is escape from the material world into the spiritual realm.' Is this Christian teaching?",
    "expected": "This is Gnosticism, an ancient heresy. It contradicts Christianity in multiple ways: Christianity teaches salvation through faith in Christ's public work (not secret knowledge), affirms the goodness of God's material creation (Genesis 1), and proclaims resurrection of the body (not escape from physicality). Gnosticism was explicitly condemned by early church fathers and the New Testament writings (especially 1 John and Colossians).",
    "output": "Based on the teachings of orthodox Christianity, as defined by the consensus of the early Church Councils (like Nicaea, Chalcedon, Ephesus) and the historical understanding of Scripture, **this group's teaching represents heresy, specifically Gnosticism.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n1.  **Salvation through Secret Knowledge (Gnosis):**\n    *   **Orthodox View:** Salvation is a gift of God's grace received through faith in Jesus Christ, His death for sins, and resurrection, as proclaimed publicly in the Gospel (e.g., Romans 3:21-26, Ephesians 2:8-9, 1 Corinthians 15:1-8). It's accessible to all who repent and believe, not dependent on secret or esoteric knowledge.\n    *   **Heresy:** This group teaches salvation comes from *secret spiritual knowledge* hidden from the masses. This directly contradicts the core Christian principle of salvation through faith in the *publicly proclaimed* person and work of Christ. It introduces an elitist, knowledge-based system that undermines the universality and accessibility of the Gospel. This is a hallmark of Gnosticism, which taught that salvation was achieved through secret knowledge (gnosis) of one's divine origin and the way to escape the material prison.\n\n2.  **Matter is Evil:**\n    *   **Orthodox View:** God created the physical universe (matter) and declared it \"good\" (Genesis 1:1, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). God became incarnate in human flesh (John 1:14, Philippians 2:5-7), affirming the goodness of matter. Christians await the resurrection of the *body* and the renewal/restoration of all creation (Romans 8:19-22, Revelation 21:1). The physical world is not inherently evil but is the arena for God's redemption.\n    *   **Heresy:** Declaring matter inherently evil is a radical dualism that directly contradicts Genesis 1. It denies the goodness of God's creation. It also undermines the Incarnation (God becoming flesh) and the promise of bodily resurrection. Gnosticism was fundamentally dualistic, viewing the material world as a prison created by an inferior, ignorant, or even evil demiurge, in contrast to the purely spiritual, good God.\n\n3.  **Salvation is Escape from the Material World:**\n    *   **Orthodox View:** Christian salvation is not an escape *from* the material world, but a redemption *of* it. It involves forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God, eternal life beginning now, and ultimately the resurrection of the body and the renewal of creation. Salvation is holistic, encompassing spirit, soul, *and* body (1 Thessalonians 5:23). The goal is not disembodied existence but renewed, perfected life in a renewed, perfected physical universe.\n    *   **Heresy:** Teaching that salvation is escape *into* a purely spiritual realm denies the biblical hope of resurrection and new creation. It promotes a Platonic or Gnostic contempt for the physical body and the created order, viewing them as cages to be escaped rather than aspects of God's good creation to be redeemed. This contradicts the core Christian narrative of God acting *within* history and creation to save it.\n\n**Why is this Gnosticism?**\n\n*   **Core Tenets:** This group's teaching encapsulates the defining features of Gnosticism:\n    *   **Radical Dualism:** Sharp opposition between spirit (good) and matter (evil).\n    *   **Secret Knowledge:** Salvation comes through hidden, esoteric revelation (gnosis), not public faith in Christ.\n    *   **Contempt for the Physical:** Rejection of the body and the material world as prisons or evils to be escaped.\n    *   **Elitism:** The \"masses\" lack the special knowledge needed for salvation.\n*   **Contradicts Foundational Christian Doctrines:**\n    *   **Creation:** God created matter and called it good.\n    *   **Incarnation:** God became flesh.\n    *   **Resurrection:** Believers will be raised with physical, glorified bodies.\n    *   **Salvation:** By grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not secret knowledge.\n    *   **Gospel Proclamation:** The message is public, not hidden.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis group's teaching is fundamentally opposed to the core doctrines of the Incarnation, Creation, Resurrection, and the nature of Salvation as understood by orthodox Christianity throughout its history. It represents a classic form of **Gnostic heresy**, which the early Church fiercely debated and condemned (e.g., by Irenaeus in *Against Heresies*, Tertullian, Origen). Salvation, according to orthodox Christian teaching, is found in the person and work of Jesus Christ, received through faith, and encompasses the redemption of the whole person and the entire created order, not an escape from it into a disembodied spiritual realm.",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the group's teaching as Gnosticism, a historic heresy, and explains why it contradicts orthodox Christianity: (1) salvation through secret gnosis vs. salvation by grace through faith in Christ’s publicly proclaimed gospel; (2) the goodness of matter creation vs. dualistic, anti-material tendencies; (3) the goal of salvation as liberation from matter vs. the biblical hope of the resurrection of the body and the restoration of creation. It grounds claims in Scripture (citing Romans 3:21-26; Ephesians 2:8-9; 1 Corinthians 15:1-8; Genesis 1; Romans 8:19-22; Revelation 21) and appeals to patristic/early church consensus (Irenaeus, Tertullian, etc.) and the rejection of Gnosticism in early Christianity. Nuance is well-handled: it notes radical dualism, elitism, and the public nature of the gospel against hidden knowledge, and it contrasts Gnostic error with historic Christian soteriology, creation/Incarnation/Resurrection, and gospel proclamation. A minor caveat is the broad assertion that councils like Nicaea, Chalcedon, and Ephesus define orthodoxy; they primarily address Christology and doctrinal definitions, with Gnostic error being condemned in patristic writings and creeds. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."
