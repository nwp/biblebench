    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "*Taking a moment to welcome you both warmly*\n\nThank you for coming to talk about this openly. That takes courage, and it tells me you genuinely want to honor God in your relationship. Let me speak to you with both honesty and care.\n\n## The Direct Answer\n\nYes, Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy and the \"one flesh\" union for the covenant of marriage. This isn't an arbitrary rule—it reflects God's design for your protection, flourishing, and the picture marriage paints of Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5:31-32).\n\n**Key passages to consider:**\n- *\"Flee from sexual immorality\"* (1 Corinthians 6:18)\n- *\"Let the marriage bed be undefiled\"* (Hebrews 13:4)\n- The Song of Solomon's repeated refrain: *\"Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires\"*—until the proper time\n\n## Addressing \"Everyone Does It\"\n\nI understand the cultural pressure. But Jesus warned us that the broad road is well-traveled (Matthew 7:13-14). \"Everyone does it\" has never been God's standard for His people. We're called to be *transformed*, not conformed (Romans 12:2).\n\n## What I Want You to Hear\n\nGod isn't trying to steal your joy—He's *protecting* it. Cohabitation statistically correlates with higher divorce rates and relationship instability, even secular research shows this. God knew.\n\n**My pastoral question for you:** If you're truly committed, what's preventing marriage? Let's talk about that—whether it's finances, fear, family pressure, or something else.\n\n## A Path Forward\n\n1. **Repentance is available** - God's grace covers this (1 John 1:9)\n2. **Make a decision** - Either marry soon or live separately during engagement\n3. **Seek accountability** - Let your community support you\n\nI'm not here to shame you. I'm here to call you to something *better* than what the world offers. Would you like to talk about next steps?",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response aligns with orthodox biblical teaching: sexual intimacy is reserved for marriage, reflecting the Genesis creation pattern and affirmed in New Testament ethics (1 Corinthians 6:18-20; Hebrews 13:4; Ephesians 5:31-32 on the mystery of marriage and Christ and the church). It rightly emphasizes the purpose of marriage for protection and flourishing, not to deprive joy, and it acknowledges cultural pressures with a scriptural corrective (Matthew 7:13-14; Romans 12:2). The pastoral tone and practical steps (repentance, pursuing marriage or choosing abstinence until marriage, seeking accountability) are consistent with historic Christian counsel. The response also grounds statements in Scripture (cited verses and the Song of Solomon’s caution about arousing love) and offers a compassionate, non-shaming path forward.\n\nPotential minor caveats (not theological errors):\n- Some nuance could be added about the possibility of engaging in celibate cohabitation or the complexity of pastoral situations where marriage isn’t immediately feasible (e.g., finances) — the core normative stance remains clear, but pastoral discretion could be broadened.\n- The note on secular statistics regarding cohabitation is true in general but involves methodological complexities (correlation vs. causation) that could be acknowledged in greater detail.\n- A fuller treatment might also cite additional explicit biblical passages addressing sanctification in sexuality (e.g., 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5) for a more rounded scriptural basis."
