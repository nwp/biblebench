        "input": "Can a woman serve as the senior pastor of a church?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Whether a woman can serve as the senior pastor of a church depends entirely on the specific denomination, tradition, and governance structure of the church in question. Different Christian traditions interpret the Bible and church history differently regarding women in leadership roles.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how various major Christian traditions view this issue:\n\n### 1. Denominations That Ordain Women\nMany mainline Protestant denominations and evangelical churches fully affirm women in pastoral leadership, including the role of senior pastor. These groups generally hold an **egalitarian** view, believing that spiritual gifts and leadership calls are not restricted by gender. They often cite biblical passages such as Galatians 3:28 (\"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\") and point to female leaders in the New Testament (such as Phoebe, Priscilla, and Junia).\n\nDenominations that commonly ordain women include:\n*   **United Methodist Church**\n*   **Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA)**\n*   **Presbyterian Church (USA)**\n*   **Episcopal Church**\n*   **American Baptist Churches USA**\n*   **Assemblies of God**\n*   **Church of God (Cleveland)**\n*   **The Nazarene**\n*   Many **Non-denominational** churches\n\n### 2. Denominations That Do Not Ordain Women\nOther Christian traditions hold a **complementarian** or hierarchical view, believing that while men and women are equal in value, they have distinct roles. They interpret passages such as 1 Timothy 2:12 (\"I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man\") and 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 as restricting the office of senior pastor (or elder) to qualified men.\n\nDenominations that generally do not ordain women as senior pastors include:\n*   **Roman Catholic Church:** Women cannot be ordained as priests. While they can serve in other leadership roles (such as parish administrators or directors of religious education), the priest and ultimate head of the parish must be a male.\n*   **Southern Baptist Convention (SBC):** In 2000, the SBC Baptist Faith and Message was revised to state that the office of pastor is limited to men. While some SBC churches have female staff members, the role of senior pastor is reserved for men.\n*   **Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS)**\n*   **Presbyterian Church in America (PCA)**\n*   **Eastern Orthodox Church**\n*   **Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints** (Mormon)\n\n### 3. Distinctions in Roles\nIn denominations that do not allow women to be senior pastors, women often still serve in significant capacities:\n*   **Preaching and Teaching:** In some conservative churches, women may preach occasionally or teach other women and children, even if they cannot hold the title of Senior Pastor.\n*   **Co-Ed Leadership:** In some non-denominational churches, a husband and wife may serve as \"co-pastors\" or \"lead pastors,\" sharing the duties of the senior role.\n*   **Other Ministries:** Women frequently serve as worship leaders, mission directors, or deacons (in denominations that allow female deacons).\n\n### Summary\nIf you are asking about a specific church, the best way to find out is to check their **Statement of Faith** or **Bylaws**. In the United States, the number of female senior pastors has been steadily increasing, particularly within mainline Protestant and progressive evangelical circles.",
