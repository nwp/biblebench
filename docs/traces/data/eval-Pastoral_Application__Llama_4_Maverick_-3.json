    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "My dear friend, I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your child. My heart goes out to you in this unimaginable pain. I'm here to listen, to weep with you, and to offer what comfort and guidance I can from Scripture.\n\nFirst, let me acknowledge that the statements you've heard from others, though likely coming from a place of trying to offer comfort, can be hurtful and even damaging. The idea that \"everything happens for a reason\" or that your child's death was \"God's will\" can be a stumbling block, rather than a source of solace.\n\nThe Bible teaches us that God is not the author of evil or suffering (James 1:13-17, Habakkuk 1:13). Suffering and death entered the world through human sin and rebellion against God (Genesis 3, Romans 5:12-19). While God can bring good out of evil (Genesis 50:20, Romans 8:28), that doesn't mean He willed or caused the evil itself.\n\nIn the case of your child's death, we must recognize that it was a tragic accident, a consequence of a fallen world where sin and its effects still ravage our lives. It's not something God delighted in or orchestrated.\n\nThe Bible does teach us that God is sovereign over all things, including the events of our lives (Psalm 103:19, Isaiah 46:9-10). However, His sovereignty is not about micromanaging every detail but about His ability to work all things, even our sufferings, towards our ultimate good and His glory (Romans 8:28-30).\n\nIn your grief, it's essential to bring your questions and emotions to God. He's not afraid of your doubts or anger (Psalm 22, Job 38-42). He's big enough to handle them. You can cry out to Him like David did in Psalm 13, \"How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?\"\n\nAs you navigate this dark valley, remember that you're not alone. God is with you, weeping with you (John 11:35). He's a God who suffers with His people (Isaiah 63:9, Matthew 25:31-46). \n\nThe hope we have in Christ is not that we'll avoid suffering or understand why certain tragedies occur, but that we'll be with Him forever, where there's no more suffering or death (Revelation 21:4). For now, we walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7).\n\nIf you're willing, I'd like to pray with you, to ask God to comfort you and give you the strength to face each day. May His presence be your peace, and may His Word be your guide in the days ahead.",

            "In some theological traditions, especially historic Calvinism, God is said to ordain all things, including suffering and death. The response adopts a view that God does not will or orchestrate the tragedy, which is a legitimate and common pastoral stance but not universally held across all orthodox traditions. This could misrepresent the spectrum of classical Christian thought on divine sovereignty and predestination.",
            "Calling the child's death an “accident” frames it as a mere happenstance without acknowledging that in a fallen world tragedies can be permitted or ordained within God’s sovereign plan in some theological systems. While the language is pastorally comforting, it risks implying that such events are simply accidents rather than events within God’s permissive or ordained will, depending on doctrinal stance.",
            "A brief clarifying note on Habakkuk 1:13: the verse speaks of God’s holiness and purity rather than a formal, explicit blanket statement about God never being the author of evil. Using it to assert God is never the author of any suffering is common, but should be handled with care to avoid overgeneralizing the passage’s specific context."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the response aligns with mainstream evangelical teaching that Scripture distinguishes between God’s sovereignty and His will, that suffering results from living in a fallen world, and that God can redeem suffering (Romans 8:28; 50:20). It grounds claims in multiple Scripture references, affirms lament and God’s nearness, and avoids simplistic explanations. The main nuance missing is a fuller engagement with how different Christian traditions conceptualize divine sovereignty and ordination of events; explicitly naming that diversity would enhance doctrinal precision. The key corrective focus would be to acknowledge that while many teach God does not actively will evil, some traditions teach that God permits or even ordains all that comes to pass for His purposes, which affects how one explains a tragedy like a child’s death.)"
