    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.' Is this teaching orthodox or heretical? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "Short answer: Heretical. It expresses Adoptionism.\n\nWhy this is Adoptionism and why it’s rejected by orthodox teaching:\n- Core claim contradicts orthodox Christology: The assertion that Jesus was “adopted as God’s Son at his baptism” makes Jesus a mere human who becomes divine by adoption. Classical Christianity holds that Jesus is not created or adopted into divinity; he is the eternal Son, the second Person of the Trinity, who becomes incarnate in a true human nature.\n- Destroys the doctrine of the Incarnation and the Trinity: If Jesus is not divine by nature but merely adopted, there is no eternally begotten Son, no shared divine essence, and no co-equal worship due to him. This undercuts key elements of the Trinity and the reconciliatory work of Christ.\n- Conflicts with scripture and the creeds:\n  - John 1:1-14 proclaims that the Word was God and became flesh, implying pre-existent divinity with the Father.\n  - Colossians 2:9 says in Christ “the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.”\n  - Hebrews 1:3 speaks of the Son as the radiance of God’s glory and the exact imprint of his nature.\n  - Philippians 2:6-11 describes Christ’s pre-existence and voluntaryincarnation, not an adoption at a particular event.\n  - The Nicene Creed (and Constantinopolitan Creed, etc.) explicitly states Jesus is “begotten, not made, of one being with the Father,” i.e., eternal in deity.\n  - Chalcedon affirms two natures (fully God and fully human) in one person, not a human who becomes divine later.\n- Historical context: Adoptionism was condemned in the early church (e.g., the case of Paul of Samosata) and by later ecumenical councils. The creeds and Christological definitions were developed to guard against exactly this kind of teaching.\n- Practical and pastoral implications: If Jesus is not truly divine, the atonement and resurrection lose their ground; salvation is no longer rooted in a divine act capable of reconciling humanity to God. Worship and prayer directed to Jesus as the eternal Son would be misplaced.\n\nWhat to affirm instead (orthodox teaching):\n- Jesus is eternal God the Son, who became incarnate in the womb of the Virgin Mary.\n- He is consubstantial with the Father (homoousios) and partakes of one divine essence with the Father and the Holy Spirit.\n- In Jesus, true God and true man are united in one Person, the Word made flesh, so that he can redeem humanity.\n- Baptism is the Father’s public declaration of Jesus’ mission and identity, not the moment of his divine adoption.\n\nIf you’re explaining this to someone who holds the adoptionist view, you can point them to the creeds (Nicene, Chalcedonian) and key biblical texts (John 1; Colossians 1-2; Hebrews 1; Philippians 2) to show that orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus’ divinity from all eternity, not by adoption at a later event.",

          "rationale": "The LLM accurately identifies Adoptionism as the heretical view in question and correctly contrasts it with orthodox Christology: Jesus is the eternal Son, not a created or adopted figure, and he possesses the divine nature from all eternity. It ties the claim to the Trinity and the Incarnation, noting that adopting a view of Jesus as merely human who is adopted at baptism undermines the doctrine of the Trinity, the pre-existence of the Son, and the atonement. The response appeals to key biblical texts (John 1:1-14; Colossians 1-2; Hebrews 1; Philippians 2) and to creeds (Nicene, Constantinopolitan) and Chalcedon to support the orthodox position that Jesus is one person with two natures, fully God and fully man, eternally begotten of the Father. Historical context ( Paul of Samosata and ecumenical condemnations) is correctly cited to show the consensus against Adoptionism. The section on what to affirm instead is aligned with standard orthodoxy: the Incarnation, the ίδια essence with the Father (homoousios), and the baptismal declaration—not divine adoption at a particular event. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced in its presentation of distinctions between adoptionism and orthodox teaching. "
