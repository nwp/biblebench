        "output": "This is one of the most debated moral questions, and thoughtful people hold genuinely different views. Let me walk through the major perspectives and considerations.\n\n## The View That Abortion Is Always Wrong\n\nMany people believe abortion is morally impermissible in all circumstances. Their reasoning typically includes:\n\n- **Fetal personhood**: They argue that a developing human has inherent moral status from conception (or shortly after), and this status doesn't change based on gestational age or circumstances.\n- **Right to life principle**: If the fetus is a person with a right to life, then ending that life is morally equivalent to other killings, regardless of context.\n- **Inalienable rights**: Some argue that certain rights (like life) can't be traded away or outweighed by other considerations.\n\n## The View That Circumstances Matter\n\nOthers believe the moral status of abortion depends on context. Key considerations include:\n\n- **Gestational development**: Some argue that moral status develops gradually—early embryos lack characteristics (like consciousness, pain perception, viability outside the womb) that matter morally.\n- **Women's bodily autonomy**: Many argue that people have absolute control over their own bodies, and no one can be forced to use their body to sustain another life—even a potential life.\n- **Extreme circumstances**: Some who are generally pro-choice still see certain cases (late-term, sex selection, etc.) as more morally concerning.\n- **Competing rights**: When pregnancy threatens the woman's life, some argue self-defense principles apply.\n\n## The Gray Areas\n\nMost real-world debate happens between these poles. Common middle-ground views include:\n\n- **First trimester boundaries**: Accepting early abortion but becoming more restrictive as pregnancy progresses\n- **Life exception**: Allowing abortion when the woman's life is at risk but otherwise restricting it\n- **Rape/incest exceptions**: Making allowances for conception through violation\n- **Health exception**: Permitting abortion when serious physical or mental health is at stake\n\n## What Makes This Complex\n\nThe debate often comes down to **two foundational disagreements**:\n\n1. **When does moral status begin?** (conception, viability, consciousness, birth?)\n2. **How do we weigh competing rights?** (the right to life vs. bodily autonomy)\n\nThese questions don't have scientific answers—they're philosophical and moral ones, which is why people of good faith continue to disagree.\n\nThe honest answer is that whether abortion is \"always wrong\" or sometimes acceptable depends heavily on which moral premises you accept about personhood, rights, and weighing competing interests.",
