    "expected": "This is heretical modalism (also called Sabellianism). It denies the distinctness of the three persons of the Trinity. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct persons who exist simultaneously and eternally, not one person appearing in different modes. The baptism of Jesus shows this distinctness: the Son is baptized, the Spirit descends, and the Father speaks - all at the same time.",
    "output": "This teaching is **not orthodox**; it is the classic heresy known as **Modalism** (also called **Sabellianism** or “Oneness” in some modern forms).\n\n## Why it’s heretical\nThe statement claims the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are merely **temporary roles or “modes”** of a single divine person—like one actor changing masks. That denies what historic Christianity confesses: **God is one in essence, but three distinct Persons**.\n\nOrthodox Trinitarian doctrine teaches:\n\n- **One God** (one divine essence/nature)\n- **Three real, eternal Persons**: Father, Son, Holy Spirit\n- The Persons are **not** the same Person under different names; they are distinct in their relations (the Father is not the Son, etc.), yet fully and equally God.\n\nModalism collapses the three Persons into one Person and so rejects the personal distinctions within God. The early church identified this as a serious error because it distorts the Gospel and Scripture’s revelation of God.\n\n## Why Scripture conflicts with “different hats”\nThe Bible repeatedly depicts the Father, Son, and Spirit acting **simultaneously** and relating to one another, not as one Person switching roles over time:\n\n- **Jesus’ baptism (Matthew 3:16–17):**  \n  The Son is baptized, the Spirit descends, and the Father speaks from heaven—three acting at once.\n- **Jesus’ prayer and intercession:**  \n  The Son prays to the Father (e.g., John 17). That is not intelligible if “Father” and “Son” are merely the same Person wearing different hats.\n- **The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19):**  \n  Baptize “in the name” (singular) **of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit”**—a unified divine name, yet three distinct referents.\n\n## Church history: why the church rejected it\nModalism was rejected by early orthodox writers and definitively excluded by the church’s Trinitarian dogma as articulated in the **Nicene tradition** (Nicaea 325; Constantinople 381). The creedal faith is not “one Person with three roles,” but **three Persons, one God**.\n\n## What orthodox Christianity says instead\nA more accurate summary is:\n\n> God is **one** in being and **three** in Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—co-eternal and co-equal, truly distinct yet not divided.\n\nSo, the “different hats” model is **incorrect** because it denies the real, eternal personal distinctions within the Trinity and contradicts Scripture and the historic creedal faith.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately identifies the teaching as Modalism/Sabellianism and explains why it is orthodoxly rejected. It correctly states the core orthodox formula: one God in essence, three eternal, distinct persons (Father, Son, Spirit) who are co-equal and co-eternal. It supports this with biblical examples commonly cited in defense of the Trinity (the Trinity’s presence in Jesus’ baptism, Jesus’ prayer to the Father, and the Triune formula in Matthew 28:19). It also aligns with historical dogma (Nicene- Constantinople) and clarifies that Modalism collapses the personal distinctions into one person. The answer preserves important nuances, such as the distinction between personal relationships and the divine essence, and why the “different hats” metaphor is inadequate. A minor enhancement could have included a brief note on economic vs immanent Trinity or the doctrine of perichoresis for deeper nuance, but the core points are correct and well-supported by Scripture and church history."
