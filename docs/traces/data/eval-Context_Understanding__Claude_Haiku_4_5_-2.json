          "rationale": "The LLM accurately identifies the primary addressee of Romans as the church in Rome and supports this with Romans 1:7 and 1:15. It correctly notes the audience’s likely Jewish and Gentile composition and that Paul had not yet visited Rome, which aligns with common scholarly consensus. The stated purposes are well-supported: (1) explaining the gospel (notably justification by faith), (2) addressing Jewish–Gentile tensions, (3) seeking support and expressing intent to visit Rome and travel to Spain, and (4) establishing doctrinal clarity on sin, grace, the role of the law, and God's plan of salvation. The response also captures the scholarly context, citing the traditional dating (c. 55–58 CE) and the likely setting from Corinth, which is a standard view among many scholars. It uses appropriate hedging for debated points (e.g., “likely from Corinth,” “Traditional view”) and does not overstate consensus where nuance exists. A minor caveat worth noting but not a factual error would be that some details about the precise origin and founders of the Roman church are debated in scholarship, and Romans’ dating and place of composition are subject to scholarly debate; the response already signals this with qualifiers. Overall, the answer directly addresses the question and presents an accurate, well-supported summary."
