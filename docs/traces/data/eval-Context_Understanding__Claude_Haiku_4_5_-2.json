          "rationale": "The answer accurately identifies the primary recipient as the church in Rome (Romans 1:7), notes that Paul had not yet founded that church, and correctly describes the likely Jewish+Gentile composition. It outlines the principal purposes of Romans (introducing Paul and his gospel, explaining his missionary approach, addressing tensions between Jew/Gentile and the Torah, promoting unity, and soliciting support for his forthcoming ministry, including the plan to go to Spain and the Jerusalem collection). The dating and location (circa 57–58 CE from Corinth, with a relief collection for Jerusalem) align with mainstream scholarship. The response also uses appropriate hedging where evidence is not absolute (e.g., “likely,” “probably”), reflecting scholarly uncertainty. The core information directly answers the question and remains within accepted historical context. No factual errors or significant omissions are present."
