    "output": "Christians disagree on this. **Eternal conscious torment (ECT)** is a long‑standing majority view in Western Christianity, but it is not the only view held by serious Bible‑believing Christians. The main options are:\n\n## 1) Eternal conscious torment (traditional view)\n**Claim:** Those who die alienated from God remain consciously punished forever.\n\n**Commonly cited texts:**\n- **Matthew 25:46** — “eternal punishment” contrasted with “eternal life.”\n- **Mark 9:43–48** — “unquenchable fire… their worm does not die.”\n- **Revelation 14:11** — “the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever… no rest.”\n- **Revelation 20:10, 14–15** — lake of fire; “tormented day and night forever and ever” (explicitly said of the devil, beast, and false prophet; many infer similar for the lost).\n- **Luke 16:19–31** — the rich man in torment (often taken as evidence of conscious post‑mortem suffering, though others read it as a parable).\n\n**Reasoning:** “Eternal” is taken to describe the ongoing experience of punishment, not only its outcome; and imagery of “torment/no rest” is read straightforwardly.\n\n## 2) Annihilationism / conditional immortality\n**Claim:** The final punishment is real and severe, but it ends in **destruction**—the lost ultimately **cease to exist** (or are not kept alive forever).\n\n**Commonly cited texts:**\n- **Matthew 10:28** — God can “destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.”\n- **John 3:16** — the alternative to life is to “perish.”\n- **Romans 6:23** — “the wages of sin is death.”\n- **2 Thessalonians 1:9** — “eternal destruction” (often read as a permanent result).\n- **Malachi 4:1–3** — the wicked burned up like stubble/ashes (imagery used to support final extinction).\n\n**Reasoning:** “Eternal punishment” can mean a punishment with **eternal effect** (irreversible death), and biblical language about “death,” “perishing,” and “destruction” is taken more literally than “ongoing torment.”\n\n## 3) Universal reconciliation (universalism)\n**Claim:** God’s judgment is real but ultimately **restorative**, and in the end God will reconcile all.\n\n**Commonly cited texts:**\n- **1 Corinthians 15:22–28** — “as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive… that God may be all in all.”\n- **Romans 5:18** — “one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all.”\n- **Colossians 1:20** — God will “reconcile to himself all things.”\n- **Philippians 2:10–11** — every knee bows and every tongue confesses (taken by some as willing, saving confession).\n\n**Reasoning:** God’s final victory and will to save are emphasized; “eternal” language is sometimes argued to mean “age‑long” in certain contexts.\n\n## A key issue: what “eternal” and the imagery mean\nMuch turns on how terms like **Gehenna**, **lake of fire**, and **“forever and ever”**, plus the Greek **aiōnios** (“eternal/age‑lasting”), are understood—whether as strictly literal duration, symbolic apocalyptic imagery, or describing an irreversible outcome.\n\n## Also: “unbeliever” is not always treated as a simple category\nMany traditions caution against confidently labeling specific individuals’ destinies. For example, some distinguish between willful rejection of known truth and ignorance, deception, diminished responsibility, etc., leaving final judgment to God’s justice and mercy.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me your background (e.g., evangelical Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, or “just reading the Bible”), I can summarize how that tradition typically answers and why, with the strongest passages they appeal to.",

It predominantly describes the views rather than authentically endorsing one with minimal disclaimers, which indicates partial compliance at best and no full alignment with a single requested perspective."
