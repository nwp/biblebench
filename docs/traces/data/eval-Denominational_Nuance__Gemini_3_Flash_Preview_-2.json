    "expected": "Calvinism and Arminianism differ primarily on sovereignty and free will. Calvinists emphasize God's unconditional election, where God chooses who will be saved based solely on His will (TULIP: Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance of saints). Arminians emphasize that God's election is based on foreknowledge of who will freely choose faith, that Christ's atonement is unlimited, that grace can be resisted, and that believers can potentially lose salvation. Both affirm salvation by grace through faith and God's sovereignty, but differ on how divine sovereignty relates to human choice. Both views have been held by orthodox Christians throughout church history.",
    "output": "The tension between Calvinism (Reformed theology) and Arminianism represents one of the most significant and enduring dialogues in Protestant history. Both traditions affirm core Christian doctrines—such as the Trinity, the deity of Christ, and salvation by grace through faith—but they differ on how God’s sovereignty interacts with human will in the process of salvation.\n\nHere is an overview of their differences, traditionally categorized by the \"Five Points\" of each system.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Nature of Human Depravity\nBoth traditions agree that humanity is fallen and incapable of saving itself. However, they differ on the *extent* of that inability.\n\n*   **The Calvinist View (Total Depravity):** Because of the Fall, humans are spiritually dead. Their will is enslaved to sin, rendering them not only unwilling but also unable to choose God unless God first sovereignly regenerates them.\n*   **The Arminian View (Total Depravity + Prevenient Grace):** Arminians agree that humans are naturally dead in sin. However, they believe God extends \"prevenient grace\" (grace that goes before) to all people. This grace restores enough human freedom to allow an individual to either accept or reject the Gospel.\n\n### 2. Election to Salvation\nBoth groups believe in \"election\" (that God chooses those who will be saved), but they disagree on the *basis* of that choice.\n\n*   **The Calvinist View (Unconditional Election):** God’s choice to save individuals is based solely on His sovereign good pleasure and secret counsel, not on anything He sees in the person (such as future faith or good works).\n*   **The Arminian View (Conditional Election):** God’s election is based on His foreknowledge. God chooses those whom He knows will, by the help of His grace, respond to the Gospel with faith. Election is \"conditional\" upon the person’s faith.\n\n### 3. The Scope of the Atonement\nThis point addresses the intent and extent of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice on the cross.\n\n*   **The Calvinist View (Limited Atonement / Particular Redemption):** While Christ’s death was sufficient for all, it was intended specifically to secure the salvation of the elect. Calvinists argue that if Christ died for everyone, and some go to hell, then Christ’s blood failed to accomplish its purpose for those individuals.\n*   **The Arminian View (Unlimited Atonement):** Christ died for every human being who has ever lived. His sacrifice makes salvation possible for everyone, but it is only effective for those who believe.\n\n### 4. The Implementation of Grace\nThis concerns how the Holy Spirit works in the heart of the believer.\n\n*   **The Calvinist View (Irresistible Grace):** When God internally calls the elect to Himself, they cannot resist. It is not that God forces them against their will; rather, He changes their heart so that they *willingly* and joyfully come to Him.\n*   **The Arminian View (Resistible Grace):** God’s grace is necessary for salvation and is offered to all, but it can be resisted. Humans have the God-given ability to say \"no\" to the Holy Spirit’s drawing.\n\n### 5. Final Perseverance\nThis point asks whether a person who has been truly saved can ever lose that salvation.\n\n*   **The Calvinist View (Perseverance of the Saints):** Those whom God has elected and called will, by His power, persevere in faith until the end. They may fall into \"backsliding\" or sin for a time, but they will never ultimately fall away.\n*   **The Arminian View (Conditional Perseverance):** There is diversity within Arminianism here. Some (Classical Arminians) historically held that because faith must be maintained, it is possible for a believer to commit apostasy and forfeit their salvation. Others (often called \"Free Grace\" or \"Once Saved Always Saved\" within an Arminian framework) believe that once a person is justified, their eternal security is guaranteed regardless of future actions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Perspectives\n\n| Topic | Calvinism (TULIP) | Arminianism (FACTS) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Depravity** | Total (Inability) | Total (Restored by Grace) |\n| **Election** | Unconditional | Conditional (Foreknown Faith) |\n| **Atonement** | Limited (Particular) | Unlimited (Universal) |\n| **Grace** | Irresistible | Resistible |\n| **Perseverance** | Guaranteed (Saints Persevere) | Conditional (Must Remain in Christ) |\n\n### Denominational Presence\n*   **Calvinist traditions** are most commonly found in Presbyterian, Reformed, and many Particular Baptist churches.\n*   **Arminian traditions** are most commonly found in Methodist, Wesleyan, Pentecostal, Nazarene, and many General Baptist churches.\n\n### A Theologian’s Reflection\nWhile these two systems are often presented as polar opposites, many Christians find themselves somewhere in the middle (sometimes called \"Amyraldianism\" or \"Calminianism\").\n\nThe fair-minded observer notes that both sides seek to protect a vital biblical truth: Calvinists seek to protect the **absolute sovereignty and glory of God** in salvation, ensuring that no human can boast. Arminians seek to protect the **moral responsibility of man** and the **sincerity of God’s universal offer of love**, ensuring that God is not viewed as the author of sin or as being arbitrary. Both traditions ultimately find their resting place in the mystery of God's character and His redemptive work in the world.",

            "The response occasionally conflates Arminian positions with Free Grace/OSAS claims. In classical Arminianism, perseverance is typically understood as conditional (faithful perseverance required); OSAS is more characteristic of Free Grace or certain minority streams rather than mainstream Arminianism. This could mislead readers about the mainstream Arminian stance.",
            "The Arminian description of election is framed as strictly 'foreknowledge of future faith.' While many Arminians use foreknowledge as a basis for election, some emphasize relational/sovereign foreknowledge without making it reducible to future human action alone. This nuance is more subtle than presented and is a live debate within Arminian thought.",
            "The table’s line for Arminian depravity (“Total (Restored by Grace)”) uses nonstandard phrasing. While prevenient grace is central to Arminianism, the label “Total (Restored by Grace)” is a potentially confusing shorthand for readers; it would be clearer to say Arminians affirm total depravity plus prevenient grace that enables a person to respond to the gospel.",
            "The use of the acronym FACTS is nonstandard and might mislead readers about the traditional framing of Arminian thought (which is often summarized with “Five Points of Arminianism” or similar variants). This is a minor stylistic issue, not a doctrinal error, but could affect clarity for those tracing historical views."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer correctly outlines the core Calvinist/Arminian contrasts (sovereignty vs. human free response, unconditional vs. conditional election, limited vs. unlimited atonement, irresistible vs. resistible grace, and perseverance). It accurately conveys major positions and denominational tendencies, and it notes potential middle-ground views (Amyraldianism, Calminianism). However, there are some nuances that could mislead readers: (1) Arminian alignment with OSAS is not representative of mainstream Arminianism, (2) election basing on foreknowledge is a common summary but not the only phrasing used in Arminian literature, and (3) the phrasing in the depravity section could be clearer about prevenient grace. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded, with good nuance, but should be careful to separate mainstream Arminianism from Free Grace and to present Arminian election language with fuller nuance.)

It notes diversity within each tradition (e.g., 'Amyraldianism', 'Calminianism'), and provides a list of denominational expressions for each camp, consistent with mainstream scholarship. A minor caveat is that the summary table and a line about 'Free Grace' within an Arminian framework could be contested by some Arminians, and some nuance about perseverance in Arminianism is simplified. Overall, the piece does not appear to privilege one tradition over the other and makes explicit efforts to be ecumenical and inclusive."
