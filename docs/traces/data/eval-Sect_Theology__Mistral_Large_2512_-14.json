    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "This is a profound and sensitive question that touches on the core of Christian identity, doctrinal boundaries, and the nature of heresy. The line between *orthodox Christianity* (small \"o,\" referring to historic, catholic—universal—Christian teaching) and groups that depart from it is not arbitrary but rooted in Scripture, early church consensus, and the development of creedal and confessional standards. Below is a theologically rigorous yet respectful analysis of how to discern orthodoxy from heterodoxy or heresy, with attention to key markers of departure.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Foundation: What Defines Orthodox Christianity?**\nOrthodox Christianity is not defined by any single denomination or tradition but by the *consensus fidelium* (agreement of the faithful) across time and space, as expressed in:\n- **Scripture** (the inspired, authoritative Word of God, canonized by the early church).\n- **The Ecumenical Creeds** (Apostles’, Nicene, Chalcedonian, Athanasian), which summarize essential doctrines.\n- **Early Church Councils** (e.g., Nicaea, Constantinople, Ephesus, Chalcedon), which clarified core teachings in response to heresies.\n- **Historic Confessions** (e.g., Augsburg, Westminster, Heidelberg, 39 Articles), which further refine doctrine within traditions.\n\nA group may use Christian language and claim to follow Jesus but still fall outside orthodoxy if it denies or distorts these foundational teachings.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Key Doctrinal Boundaries: Where the Line Is Drawn**\nThe following are *non-negotiable* doctrines that define orthodox Christianity. Departure from these (either by denial, redefinition, or omission) places a group outside the historic Christian faith. These are not \"secondary issues\" but *first-order* truths necessary for salvation and right worship.\n\n#### **A. The Nature of God (Theology Proper)**\n- **Monotheism and the Trinity**: God is one in essence (*ousia*) and three in persons (*hypostases*): Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, co-eternal, co-equal, and consubstantial (Nicene Creed).\n  - *Departures*:\n    - **Modalism** (e.g., Oneness Pentecostalism): Denies the distinct persons of the Trinity, teaching that God is one person who manifests in different \"modes.\"\n    - **Arianism** (e.g., Jehovah’s Witnesses): Denies the full deity of Christ, teaching He is a created being (\"a god\" but not God).\n    - **Tritheism**: Teaches three separate gods (e.g., some forms of Mormonism).\n    - **Subordinationism**: Teaches that the Son or Spirit is ontologically inferior to the Father (e.g., some early heresies like Eunomianism).\n\n- **God’s Attributes**: God is eternal, immutable, omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly holy. Denials of these (e.g., process theology, open theism) depart from orthodoxy.\n\n#### **B. The Person and Work of Christ (Christology)**\n- **Fully God and Fully Man**: Jesus is the eternal Son of God who took on human flesh (John 1:1, 14; Col. 2:9; Heb. 1:3). The Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) defined this as the *hypostatic union*: one person with two natures, divine and human, unmixed and undivided.\n  - *Departures*:\n    - **Docetism**: Denies Christ’s true humanity (e.g., some Gnostic groups).\n    - **Apollinarianism**: Denies Christ’s full humanity (teaching He had a divine mind in a human body).\n    - **Nestorianism**: Divides Christ into two persons (e.g., some early heresies; modern groups like the Assyrian Church of the East historically struggled with this).\n    - **Eutychianism/Monophysitism**: Teaches Christ’s human nature was absorbed into His divine nature (e.g., some Oriental Orthodox groups, though many have since clarified their position).\n    - **Adoptionism**: Teaches Jesus was a man \"adopted\" as God’s Son (e.g., some early heresies; modern groups like Christadelphians).\n\n- **The Atonement**: Christ’s death was a substitutionary sacrifice for sin (Isa. 53:5; Rom. 3:25; 1 John 2:2). While theories of the atonement vary (e.g., penal substitution, Christus Victor), denial of its necessity or efficacy is heretical.\n  - *Departures*:\n    - **Moral Influence Theory** (if it denies substitutionary atonement entirely, e.g., some liberal Protestantism).\n    - **Universalism**: Teaches all will be saved regardless of faith in Christ (e.g., some Unitarian Universalists, though not all).\n    - **Denial of the Cross’s Necessity**: Some groups (e.g., Christian Science, New Thought) teach sin is an illusion or that Christ’s death was not a real sacrifice.\n\n#### **C. Salvation (Soteriology)**\n- **By Grace Alone Through Faith Alone**: Salvation is a gift of God, not earned by works (Eph. 2:8-9; Rom. 3:28). While good works are the fruit of salvation, they are not its cause.\n  - *Departures*:\n    - **Pelagianism/Semi-Pelagianism**: Teaches humans can initiate salvation apart from grace (e.g., some forms of Roman Catholicism before Trent, though Trent affirmed grace; some modern \"prosperity gospel\" teachings).\n    - **Works-Righteousness**: Teaches salvation is earned by human effort (e.g., some forms of Mormonism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, or legalistic groups).\n    - **Universalism**: As above, denies the necessity of personal faith in Christ.\n\n- **The Necessity of Christ**: Salvation is found in Christ alone (John 14:6; Acts 4:12). Denial of this (e.g., pluralism, inclusivism that denies Christ’s exclusivity) is heretical.\n\n#### **D. The Holy Spirit and Scripture (Pneumatology and Bibliology)**\n- **The Holy Spirit is God**: The Spirit is the third person of the Trinity, not an impersonal force (Acts 5:3-4; 2 Cor. 3:17-18).\n  - *Departures*:\n    - **Montanism**: Teaches new revelations supersede Scripture (e.g., some charismatic groups that elevate prophecies or \"words of knowledge\" above Scripture).\n    - **Denial of the Spirit’s Deity**: Some groups (e.g., Jehovah’s Witnesses) teach the Spirit is a force, not a person.\n\n- **Scripture is Inspired and Authoritative**: The Bible is the Word of God, inerrant in its original manuscripts, and the final authority for faith and practice (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:20-21).\n  - *Departures*:\n    - **Denial of Inerrancy**: Some liberal Protestantism teaches the Bible contains errors or is merely a human witness to God.\n    - **Addition to Scripture**: Groups that elevate other texts (e.g., Mormonism’s *Book of Mormon*, Christian Science’s *Science and Health*) or ongoing revelation (e.g., some charismatic groups) as equal to Scripture.\n    - **Rejection of the Canon**: Some groups (e.g., Marcionites historically, some modern \"red-letter Christians\") reject parts of the Bible as uninspired.\n\n#### **E. The Church and Sacraments (Ecclesiology and Sacramentology)**\n- **One Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church**: The church is the body of Christ, united across time and space (Eph. 4:4-6). While denominations exist, the church is not divided in essence.\n  - *Departures*:\n    - **Denial of the Church’s Necessity**: Some groups (e.g., \"no-church\" movements) teach that formal church membership is unnecessary.\n    - **Exclusivist Claims**: Groups that claim to be the *only* true church (e.g., some forms of Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, or Restorationist groups like the LDS Church or Jehovah’s Witnesses).\n\n- **Sacraments/Ordinances**: Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are means of grace, though their nature is debated (e.g., paedobaptism vs. credobaptism, real presence vs. symbolic memorialism). Denial of their necessity or efficacy can be heretical.\n  - *Departures*:\n    - **Denial of Baptism’s Necessity**: Some groups (e.g., Quakers, Salvation Army) reject baptism entirely.\n    - **Denial of the Lord’s Supper’s Spiritual Reality**: Some groups (e.g., Zwinglian memorialism taken to an extreme) teach it is merely symbolic with no spiritual benefit.\n\n#### **F. Eschatology (Last Things)**\n- **Christ’s Bodily Return**: Jesus will return physically to judge the living and the dead (Acts 1:11; Rev. 19:11-16).\n  - *Departures*:\n    - **Denial of a Physical Return**: Some liberal theology teaches Christ’s return is symbolic or spiritual.\n    - **Unorthodox Millennial Views**: While premillennialism, amillennialism, and postmillennialism are within orthodoxy, some views (e.g., full-preterism, which teaches Christ already returned in 70 AD) are heretical.\n\n- **Resurrection of the Dead**: All will be raised bodily to face judgment (John 5:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:52).\n  - *Departures*:\n    - **Denial of Bodily Resurrection**: Some groups (e.g., Gnosticism, Christian Science) teach the body is evil or that resurrection is spiritual only.\n\n---\n\n### **3. How to Discern Departure from Orthodoxy**\nNot every disagreement is heresy. The early church distinguished between:\n- **Heresy**: A denial of a *core* doctrine necessary for salvation (e.g., the Trinity, Christ’s deity, justification by faith).\n- **Schism**: A division over *secondary* issues (e.g., baptism mode, church governance, worship styles).\n- **Adiaphora**: Matters indifferent to salvation (e.g., liturgical preferences, dietary laws).\n\n**Questions to Ask When Evaluating a Group:**\n1. **Do they affirm the ecumenical creeds?** If not, they are outside orthodoxy.\n2. **Do they deny or redefine core doctrines?** (See above.)\n3. **Do they add to or subtract from Scripture?** (Rev. 22:18-19)\n4. **Do they claim exclusive truth?** While all Christians believe in absolute truth, groups that claim to be the *only* true church (e.g., LDS, JWs) often do so by redefining core doctrines.\n5. **Do they teach salvation by works or another gospel?** (Gal. 1:8-9)\n\n---\n\n### **4. Examples of Groups Outside Orthodoxy**\n| **Group**               | **Key Departure**                                                                 | **Orthodox Response**                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Jehovah’s Witnesses** | Deny the Trinity, Christ’s deity, and the Holy Spirit’s personhood.               | Reject Arianism; affirm Nicene Creed.                                                |\n| **Mormonism (LDS)**     | Teach polytheism, Christ as a created being, and ongoing revelation (Book of Mormon). | Reject as a different religion; affirm historic Christian monotheism.                |\n| **Oneness Pentecostalism** | Deny the Trinity (modalism); teach baptism in Jesus’ name only for salvation.     | Reject modalism; affirm Trinitarian baptism (Matt. 28:19).                           |\n| **Christian Science**   | Deny the reality of sin, sickness, and death; teach Christ’s atonement was not real. | Reject as Gnostic; affirm the incarnation and substitutionary atonement.             |\n| **Unitarian Universalism** | Deny the Trinity, Christ’s deity, and salvation through Christ alone.             | Reject as non-Christian; affirm exclusivity of Christ.                               |\n| **Liberal Protestantism** | Deny inerrancy, miracles, or Christ’s resurrection; teach universalism.           | Reject as unfaithful to Scripture; affirm historic Christian doctrine.               |\n\n---\n\n### **5. Where the Line Is Drawn: A Summary**\nThe line is crossed when a group:\n1. **Denies the Trinity** (or redefines it beyond recognition).\n2. **Denies the full deity and humanity of Christ** (or separates His natures).\n3. **Denies salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone**.\n4. **Denies the inspiration, authority, or sufficiency of Scripture**.\n5. **Adds to or subtracts from the gospel** (e.g., works-righteousness, universalism, new revelations).\n6. **Rejects the bodily resurrection of Christ or the future resurrection of believers**.\n\n**Secondary issues** (e.g., baptism mode, church polity, eschatology) do not necessarily place a group outside orthodoxy, though they may lead to denominational distinctions.\n\n---\n\n### **6. A Pastoral and Theological Caution**\nWhile it is necessary to identify heresy for the sake of truth and the protection of the flock (Titus 1:9), we must:\n- **Distinguish between heresy and ignorance**: Some groups (e.g., new converts, cult members) may hold false beliefs out of misunderstanding rather than willful rebellion. Patient teaching is needed (2 Tim. 2:24-26).\n- **Avoid unnecessary division**: Not every disagreement is heretical. The early church tolerated diversity on secondary issues (e.g., Quartodecimanism, the date of Easter).\n- **Speak the truth in love** (Eph. 4:15): Condemnation should be reserved for persistent, unrepentant denial of core doctrines, not for sincere believers who differ on non-essentials.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Conclusion: The Heart of Orthodoxy**\nOrthodox Christianity is not about rigid dogmatism but about preserving the *gospel* in its purity—the good news that God became man in Jesus Christ, died for our sins, rose from the dead, and offers salvation by grace through faith. Any group that distorts this message, no matter how sincerely, falls outside the bounds of historic Christian faith.\n\nAs Vincent of Lérins (5th century) famously said, orthodoxy is what has been believed *\"everywhere, always, and by all\"* (*ubique, semper, ab omnibus*). While cultural and denominational expressions vary, the core of the faith remains unchanged. The line is drawn not by human preference but by the apostolic deposit of truth (Jude 3).",

Eschatology (Last Things)**\n- **Christ’s Bodily Return**: Jesus will return physically to judge the living and the dead (Acts 1:11; Rev. 19:11-16).\n  - *Departures*:\n    - **Denial of a Physical Return**: Some liberal theology teaches Christ’s return is symbolic or spiritual.\n    - **Unorthodox Millennial Views**: While premillennialism, amillennialism, and postmillennialism are within orthodoxy, some views (e.g., full-preterism, which teaches Christ already returned in 70 AD) are heretical.\n\n- **Resurrection of the Dead**: All will be raised bodily to face judgment (John 5:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:52).\n  - *Departures*:\n    - **Denial of Bodily Resurrection**: Some groups (e.g., Gnosticism, Christian Science) teach the body is evil or that resurrection is spiritual only.\n\n---\n\n### **3. How to Discern Departure from Orthodoxy**\nNot every disagreement is heresy. The early church distinguished between:\n- **Heresy**: A denial of a *core* doctrine necessary for salvation (e.g., the Trinity, Christ’s deity, justification by faith).\n- **Schism**: A division over *secondary* issues (e.g., baptism mode, church governance, worship styles).\n- **Adiaphora**: Matters indifferent to salvation (e.g., liturgical preferences, dietary laws).\n\n**Questions to Ask When Evaluating a Group:**\n1. **Do they affirm the ecumenical creeds?** If not, they are outside orthodoxy.\n2. **Do they deny or redefine core doctrines?** (See above.)\n3. **Do they add to or subtract from Scripture?** (Rev. 22:18-19)\n4. **Do they claim exclusive truth?** While all Christians believe in absolute truth, groups that claim to be the *only* true church (e.g., LDS, JWs) often do so by redefining core doctrines.\n5. **Do they teach salvation by works or another gospel?** (Gal. 1:8-9)\n\n---\n\n### **4. Examples of Groups Outside Orthodoxy**\n| **Group**               | **Key Departure**                                                                 | **Orthodox Response**                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Jehovah’s Witnesses** | Deny the Trinity, Christ’s deity, and the Holy Spirit’s personhood.               | Reject Arianism; affirm Nicene Creed.                                                |\n| **Mormonism (LDS)**     | Teach polytheism, Christ as a created being, and ongoing revelation (Book of Mormon). | Reject as a different religion; affirm historic Christian monotheism.                |\n| **Oneness Pentecostalism** | Deny the Trinity (modalism); teach baptism in Jesus’ name only for salvation.     | Reject modalism; affirm Trinitarian baptism (Matt. 28:19).                           |\n| **Christian Science**   | Deny the reality of sin, sickness, and death; teach Christ’s atonement was not real. | Reject as Gnostic; affirm the incarnation and substitutionary atonement.             |\n| **Unitarian Universalism** | Deny the Trinity, Christ’s deity, and salvation through Christ alone.             | Reject as non-Christian; affirm exclusivity of Christ.                               |\n| **Liberal Protestantism** | Deny inerrancy, miracles, or Christ’s resurrection; teach universalism.           | Reject as unfaithful to Scripture; affirm historic Christian doctrine.               |\n\n---\n\n### **5. Where the Line Is Drawn: A Summary**\nThe line is crossed when a group:\n1. **Denies the Trinity** (or redefines it beyond recognition).\n2. **Denies the full deity and humanity of Christ** (or separates His natures).\n3. **Denies salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone**.\n4. **Denies the inspiration, authority, or sufficiency of Scripture**.\n5. **Adds to or subtracts from the gospel** (e.g., works-righteousness, universalism, new revelations).\n6. **Rejects the bodily resurrection of Christ or the future resurrection of believers**.\n\n**Secondary issues** (e.g., baptism mode, church polity, eschatology) do not necessarily place a group outside orthodoxy, though they may lead to denominational distinctions.\n\n---\n\n### **6. A Pastoral and Theological Caution**\nWhile it is necessary to identify heresy for the sake of truth and the protection of the flock (Titus 1:9), we must:\n- **Distinguish between heresy and ignorance**: Some groups (e.g., new converts, cult members) may hold false beliefs out of misunderstanding rather than willful rebellion. Patient teaching is needed (2 Tim. 2:24-26).\n- **Avoid unnecessary division**: Not every disagreement is heretical. The early church tolerated diversity on secondary issues (e.g., Quartodecimanism, the date of Easter).\n- **Speak the truth in love** (Eph. 4:15): Condemnation should be reserved for persistent, unrepentant denial of core doctrines, not for sincere believers who differ on non-essentials.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Conclusion: The Heart of Orthodoxy**\nOrthodox Christianity is not about rigid dogmatism but about preserving the *gospel* in its purity—the good news that God became man in Jesus Christ, died for our sins, rose from the dead, and offers salvation by grace through faith. Any group that distorts this message, no matter how sincerely, falls outside the bounds of historic Christian faith.\n\nAs Vincent of Lérins (5th century) famously said, orthodoxy is what has been believed *\"everywhere, always, and by all\"* (*ubique, semper, ab omnibus*). While cultural and denominational expressions vary, the core of the faith remains unchanged. The line is drawn not by human preference but by the apostolic deposit of truth (Jude 3).",
