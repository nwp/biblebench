    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.' Is this teaching orthodox or heretical? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "Verdict: Heretical.\n\nWhat the teacher is saying is a classic form of adoptionism (and resembles the earlier Jewish-Christian Ebionite view): Jesus was merely a remarkable human prophet/teacher and was “adopted” as God’s Son at his baptism. That position was rejected by the historic, orthodox Christian church.\n\nWhy it’s heretical (briefly):\n\n- It denies the Son’s eternal divinity and pre‑existence. Orthodox Christianity affirms that the Son is eternally begotten of the Father, “God from God, Light from Light” (Nicene language). Saying Jesus was not truly divine but became God’s Son at a point in time contradicts the Nicene and Chalcedonian formulation of who Christ is.\n\n- It contradicts Scripture as read by the church in its tradition. Key New Testament texts understood by the church to teach the eternal deity and pre‑existence of the Son include John 1:1–14; John 8:58; Hebrews 1:1–4; Colossians 1:15–17; Philippians 2:6–11. Passages like the baptismal scene (Matt 3:13–17) are read as a public revelation/confirmation of the Son’s identity and the inauguration of his ministry, not the moment he becomes divine.\n\n- It undermines core doctrines of salvation. The classical Christian account of atonement and reconciliation depends on the unity of full divinity and full humanity in the one Person of Jesus Christ (the hypostatic union). If Jesus is not truly God, the theological grounds for reconciling sinners to God (and other central claims) collapse from the perspective of historic orthodoxy.\n\nHistorical context and condemnation:\n\n- Adoptionist-type views appear in the early centuries (e.g., Theodotus, Paul of Samosata) and later in medieval Spanish adoptionism; they were opposed by the Church Fathers and condemned by synods and the broader catholic consensus. The decisive formulations against such views are found in the councils of the early church, especially Nicaea (325) and Chalcedon (451), and in the creeds that summarize orthodox Christology.\n\nA common adoptive argument and the orthodox reply:\n\n- Adoptionists often point to the baptismal scene (the Spirit descending and the Father’s voice) as the moment of adoption. Orthodox theology replies that that event publicly manifests and endorses the eternal Son’s mission; it does not imply that the Son’s divine nature began there.\n\nConclusion: The statement is not orthodox but heretical according to historic Christian doctrine, because it denies the eternal deity of Christ and contradicts the creedal and biblical convictions that shaped orthodox Christology.",

            "Imprecision about the Council of Nicaea: while Nicene theology firmly upheld the divine eternality of the Son, that council’s primary focus was addressing Arianism; adoptionism itself was condemned in later patristic writings and councils. Nevertheless, the broader Nicene/Constantinopolitan framework rightly supports the rejection of adoptionist claims."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies adoptionism as heretical and aligns with historic orthodoxy: Jesus is the eternal Son, the hypostatic union, and Christ’s preexistence is affirmed in key biblical texts (e.g., John 1:1–14; John 8:58; Colossians 1). It accurately interprets the baptismal scene as a revelation of Jesus’ identity rather than the moment of divinity beginning. The response demonstrates solid biblical-grounding and theological nuance in distinguishing orthodoxy from adoptionist claims. A minor historical nuance could be clarified: Nicaea primarily opposed Arianism, with adoptionism condemned within the broader patristic tradition rather than as a direct, formal decree of that council."
