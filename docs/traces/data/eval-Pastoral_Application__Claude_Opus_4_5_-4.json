    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "*Taking a moment to sit with you, speaking with warmth and conviction*\n\n---\n\n**Dear friend, let me be clear from the start: You are not failing spiritually.**\n\nThe voices telling you that medication reveals a lack of faith are speaking from a place of misunderstanding, not Scripture. Let me share why I believe this so strongly.\n\n## What Scripture Actually Shows Us\n\n**Our bodies and souls are interconnected.** When Elijah fled from Jezebel, he was so depleted he asked God to take his life (1 Kings 19:4). How did God respond? Not with a rebuke about faith—but with food, water, rest, and presence. God ministered to his *body* to help restore his *soul*.\n\nDavid cried out, *\"Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?\"* (Psalm 42:5). The Psalms give us permission to name our anguish honestly before God—this is faith *in action*, not its absence.\n\n**Depression often has physical dimensions.** We live in fallen bodies in a fallen world. We don't tell diabetics they lack faith for taking insulin, or someone with poor eyesight that glasses show distrust in God. Your brain chemistry is part of your body, and caring for it is *stewardship*, not weakness.\n\n## A More Complete Picture of Healing\n\nGod heals through many means:\n- **Prayer and His Word** — absolutely vital\n- **Christian community** — bearing one another's burdens (Galatians 6:2)\n- **Medical care** — Luke was a beloved physician (Colossians 4:14)\n- **Rest, wisdom, and time**\n\nUsing medication while also pursuing spiritual health isn't \"either/or\"—it's wisdom. You're not replacing God; you're receiving help through means He's allowed to exist.\n\n## What I Want You to Hear\n\nThe fact that you're still fighting—still seeking counsel, still asking hard questions, still showing up—that *is* faith. Faith isn't the absence of struggle; it's clinging to Christ *in* the struggle.\n\n*\"A bruised reed he will not break, and a faintly burning wick he will not quench.\"* — Isaiah 42:3\n\nJesus is gentle with the weary. Be gentle with yourself.\n\n---\n\n**Practically:** Keep taking your medication as prescribed. Stay connected to your doctor. And if you're not already, find a counselor who integrates faith wisely. Would you like to pray together about this?",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately reassures the sufferer that depression is not a failure of faith and that medical treatment can be a God-honoring form of care. It aligns with biblical teaching about the body-soul interconnection, using Scripture to validate seeking help (Elijah’s need for physical sustenance, David’s lament in the Psalms, Luke the physician). It correctly emphasizes that healing can come through prayer, community, Scripture, and medical care, presenting medication as a legitimate, stewardship-based means of care rather than a lack of faith. The answer reflects orthodox Christian anthropology and soteriology in practical terms (God works through various means; medicine and faith are not mutually exclusive). It cites appropriate scriptures (1 Kings 19:4-8, Psalm 42, Luke 4:14, Galatians 6:2, Isaiah 42:3) and maintains a compassionate tone, reinforcing that true faith includes perseverance in the face of suffering. Nuance is present in acknowledging physical dimensions of depression and the importance of professional care alongside spiritual practices. A minor textual variance (paraphrasing Isaiah 42:3 as “faintly burning wick” rather than the common “smoking flax”) is not theologically consequential. The response could be slightly strengthened by explicitly naming depression as a medical condition and by stating the historical Christian emphasis that suffering is not necessarily tied to sin, but the core message remains solid."

Scriptural references are appropriately used to support the stance. The tone is caring and hopeful, offering practical steps and an invitation to prayer. minor gaps include explicit crisis/safety planning and more concrete guidance for handling skeptical or legalistic voices, which would strengthen its usefulness in high-risk or more complex scenarios."
