    "expected": "Jesus used parables to reveal truth to those with receptive hearts while concealing it from those who rejected him, and to make spiritual truths memorable through everyday stories",
    "output": "According to the New Testament accounts, Jesus used parables in his teaching to convey spiritual truths and moral lessons to his audience. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke record numerous parables spoken by Jesus, and they provide insight into his reasons for using this teaching method.\n\nThe traditional understanding, as reflected in the Gospels themselves, is that Jesus used parables to reveal truth to those who were receptive to his message, while concealing it from those who were not (Matthew 13:10-17, Mark 4:11-12, Luke 8:10). In Matthew 13:13, Jesus explains that he spoke in parables \"because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.\" This is often understood to mean that parables served as a means of judgment, separating those who were genuinely seeking to understand from those who were not.\n\nThe Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:1-23, Mark 4:1-20, Luke 8:4-15) is a key passage that illustrates Jesus' purpose in using parables. In this parable, Jesus compares the different responses to his message to various types of soil, highlighting the varied ways people receive the \"seed\" of God's word. The explanation provided by Jesus (Matthew 13:18-23, Mark 4:13-20, Luke 8:11-15) indicates that the parable is meant to teach about the different responses to his teaching and the challenges of spiritual receptivity.\n\nThe use of parables allowed Jesus to:\n\n1. Engage his audience: Parables were often drawn from everyday experiences, making them relatable and accessible to a wide range of listeners.\n2. Convey complex ideas: Parables enabled Jesus to communicate deep spiritual truths in a way that was both simple and profound.\n3. Challenge his listeners: By using parables, Jesus encouraged his audience to think critically about the message and its application to their lives.\n4. Reveal or conceal truth: As mentioned earlier, parables served as a means of judgment, separating those who were genuinely seeking to understand from those who were not.\n\nThe majority of scholars agree that Jesus' use of parables was a deliberate teaching strategy that allowed him to communicate effectively with his audience. Some scholars have suggested alternative perspectives on the purpose of parables, such as seeing them primarily as a way to subvert or challenge the social and cultural norms of his time. However, the traditional understanding, rooted in the Gospel accounts, remains the most widely accepted explanation.\n\nIn summary, Jesus used parables in his teaching to convey spiritual truths and moral lessons, engaging his audience, and challenging them to think critically about the message. The use of parables allowed him to reveal truth to those who were receptive while concealing it from those who were not, serving as a means of judgment.",

            "Claim that 'the majority of scholars agree' on parables being a deliberate teaching strategy is potentially overstated and lacks nuance; scholarship on the purpose of parables is debated and multifaceted.",
            "Misses explicit discussion of prophetic fulfillment — e.g., Matthew 13:14-15 and Mark 4:12 along with Isaiah 6:9-10 — which is a standard part of the historical-contextual reading of Jesus' use of parables.",
            "While the response notes 'reveal or conceal' truth, it could emphasize that the function of parables is multi-layered (insight for insiders, challenge for outsiders, fulfillment of prophecy) rather than a single 'judgment' thrust."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is largely accurate: Jesus did use parables to convey spiritual truths, often drawing on everyday life to engage listeners, with the Sower as an example. It correctly cites Gospel passages about selective revelation to insiders, and it captures the idea that parables challenge listeners to reflect. It also acknowledges alternative scholarly views. However, it overstates consensus in stating 'the majority of scholars' agree on a single deliberate purpose, and it omits the common scholarly emphasis on prophecy-fulfillment (Isaiah) as part of Jesus’ use of parables. It also benefits from a more explicit articulation of the multi-layered function of parables (revelation to insiders, challenge to outsiders, and prophetic fulfillment) rather than framing it primarily as judgment."
