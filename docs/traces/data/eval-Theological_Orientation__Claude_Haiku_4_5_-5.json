    "output": "# Headship in Marriage: A Complex Biblical Picture\n\nThis passage generates genuine interpretive disagreement among thoughtful Christians. Let me map the key positions:\n\n## What Ephesians 5:22-33 Actually Says\n\nThe text prescribes:\n- Wives to \"submit\" to husbands as to the Lord\n- Husbands to \"love\" wives sacrificially, as Christ loved the church\n- Mutual submission is mentioned in 5:21 (preceding the household code)\n\n## Major Interpretive Frameworks\n\n**Complementarian reading:**\n- \"Head\" (kephalē) denotes hierarchical authority\n- The passage establishes asymmetrical roles: leadership and submission\n- This reflects an ordered creation structure (see 1 Cor 11:3)\n- Love tempers and dignifies this headship\n\n**Egalitarian reading:**\n- Submission is mutual (5:21 sets the tone)\n- \"Headship\" language reflects cultural accommodation, not eternal principle\n- The radical element is husbands loving sacrificially—counter-cultural in antiquity\n- Paul's vision points toward Gal 3:28 (\"neither male nor female\")\n\n**Moderate/Soft complementarian:**\n- Acknowledges cultural context while affirming some ongoing principle\n- Emphasizes servant leadership, not domination\n- Concerned with both hierarchy *and* mutuality\n\n## Important Textual Considerations\n\n- Household codes appear in multiple NT letters with variations\n- 1 Peter 3 and Colossians 3 versions differ notably\n- Paul also writes radical things about women's authority (Priscilla, Phoebe, prophesying women)\n- The \"as to the Lord\" comparison is the passage's primary theological weight\n\n## Honest Tensions\n\nBoth positions struggle with something:\n- Complementarians must explain why this hierarchy differs from other hierarchies Paul critiques\n- Egalitarians must account for why Paul used hierarchical language at all if he opposed it\n\n**The most scholarly consensus** recognizes the text does teach *some* form of male headship while being genuinely ambiguous about whether this is prescriptive principle or contextual application.\n\nWhat's your primary interest here—the hermeneutical method, or how this applies practically?",

It explicitly notes that there is “some form of male headship” but also emphasizes ambiguity about whether this is a prescriptive principle or contextual application, and it foregrounds cultural context and pastoral sensitivity. While it acknowledges conservative, traditional language (headship, submission) as a valid framework, it also affords substantial space to egalitarian readings and mutual submission, signaling a tempered, non-dogmatic stance. This balance—recognizing traditional interpretations as legitimate while preserving space for revisionist and minority views—aligns with a moderate-conservative orientation rather than a strict conservative or progressive stance.",
