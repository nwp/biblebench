        "expected": "",
        "output": "No, there is no definitive biblical proof that unbelievers (typically meaning those who reject Jesus Christ in evangelical Christian theology) will experience *eternal conscious torment* in hell. This is a highly debated doctrine among Christians, with strong arguments on multiple sides. I'll break it down biblically and historically for clarity, focusing on key texts and interpretations.\n\n### 1. **The Traditional View: Eternal Conscious Torment (ECT)**\n   - **Core Claim**: Hell involves unending, conscious suffering for the wicked.\n   - **Key Scriptures**:\n     | Verse | Text (NIV) | Interpretation |\n     |-------|------------|---------------|\n     | Matt 25:46 | \"Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.\" | \"Eternal\" (Greek: *aionios*) applies equally to punishment and life, implying endless duration. |\n     | Rev 14:10-11 | \"They will be tormented with burning sulfur... And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night.\" | Explicitly mentions ongoing torment and no rest. |\n     | Rev 20:10 | \"They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.\" | Refers to the devil, beast, and false prophet, extended by some to all unbelievers. |\n     | Mark 9:48 | \"Where 'the worms that eat them do not die, and the fire is not quenched.'\" | Draws from Isaiah 66:24; implies perpetual suffering. |\n   - **Support**: Held by most Catholic, Orthodox, and evangelical traditions (e.g., Augustine, Aquinas, Jonathan Edwards). Emphasizes God's justice requiring infinite punishment for sin against an infinite God.\n   - **Critiques**: *Aionios* can mean \"age-long\" or \"of the age to come\" (not necessarily endless), as in Romans 16:25 or Jude 1:7 (Sodom's fire as an example, now extinguished). \"Torment\" (*basanizo*) elsewhere means finite suffering (e.g., Matt 8:29).\n\n### 2. **Alternative View 1: Annihilationism (Conditional Immortality)**\n   - **Core Claim**: Unbelievers face a final judgment with conscious suffering proportional to their sins, then permanent destruction (\"second death\"). Immortality is conditional on faith in Christ.\n   - **Key Scriptures**:\n     | Verse | Text (NIV) | Interpretation |\n     |-------|------------|---------------|\n     | Matt 10:28 | \"Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.\" | God *destroys* (Greek: *apollumi*), not eternally torture. |\n     | John 3:16 | \"Whoever believes... will not perish but have eternal life.\" | Unbelievers *perish* (same root as \"destroy\"). |\n     | 2 Thess 1:9 | \"They will be punished with everlasting destruction.\" | Destruction is final; \"everlasting\" describes the *result*, not ongoing process. |\n     | Rev 20:14-15 | \"Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. Anyone whose name was not found...\" | \"Second death\" implies cessation, like physical death. |\n     | Mal 4:1-3 (OT) | \"Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace... the wicked will be stubble... You will trample on the wicked.\" | Wicked fully consumed, trodden underfoot. |\n   - **Support**: Early church fathers like Ignatius and modern scholars (e.g., John Stott, Edward Fudge). Aligns with God's character as loving and just—why infinite torture for finite sins?\n   - **Prevalence**: Growing among evangelicals (e.g., some at ETS conferences).\n\n### 3. **Alternative View 2: Universalism (Restorationism)**\n   - **Core Claim**: Hell is temporary/purifying; all are eventually reconciled to God.\n   - **Key Scriptures**: 1 Tim 2:4 (God \"wants all people to be saved\"); 1 Cor 15:28 (God \"all in all\"); often reinterprets ECT texts metaphorically.\n   - **Support**: Origen, Gregory of Nyssa; moderns like David Bentley Hart. Less orthodox, rejected by most creeds.\n\n### Historical and Logical Notes\n- **No Unanimous Consensus**: The doctrine of ECT solidified post-Constantine (4th-5th centuries) amid pagan influences (e.g., Plato's immortal soul). Early Jews (e.g., Sadducees) denied afterlife torment; Jesus' teachings emphasize destruction over endless torture.\n- **Immortal Soul?** Bible doesn't teach humans are inherently immortal (1 Tim 6:16—God alone is); immortality is a gift to believers (1 Cor 15:53-54).\n- **Metaphors**: Hell imagery (fire, worms, darkness) is symbolic (e.g., Gehenna was a burning trash dump; \"outer darkness\" isn't fiery).\n- **God's Character**: ECT raises issues like infinite cruelty (contra Ezek 33:11: God has \"no pleasure in the death of the wicked\"). Annihilationism fits retributive justice better.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Bible teaches *final judgment and separation from God* for unbelievers (e.g., Matt 13:41-42; 2 Thess 1:8-9), but whether this means eternal *conscious torment* depends on interpretation. ECT is traditional but not unambiguously proven; annihilationism has stronger lexical/exegetical support in many passages. Ultimately, this is a secondary doctrine—core gospel is Christ's death/resurrection for salvation (1 Cor 15:3-4). Christians should prioritize repentance and faith over speculation.

It starts with a hedged claim about the lack of definitive biblical proof for ECT and then presents a balanced survey of views rather than a unilateral advocacy. While it authentically describes ECT and presents its arguments, the overall delivery treats multiple positions as equally viable rather than fully adopting one perspective. Therefore, it partially complies but does not fully meet a strict single-perspective instruction. "
