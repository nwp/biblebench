    "input": "A Jehovah's Witness says that Jesus was not physically resurrected - instead, God disposed of his body and Jesus was raised as a spirit creature. What does orthodox Christianity teach about Jesus' resurrection?",
    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity affirms the bodily, physical resurrection of Jesus as essential to the faith (1 Corinthians 15:14). Jesus appeared in a physical body that could be touched (Luke 24:39, John 20:27), ate food (Luke 24:42-43), and still bore the crucifixion wounds. The empty tomb accounts confirm the body was gone because Jesus was raised, not that it was discarded. Jesus explicitly denied being merely a spirit: 'a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have' (Luke 24:39). The physical resurrection guarantees believers' future bodily resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:20-23) and validates Jesus' victory over death. Denying the physical resurrection undermines the gospel.",
    "output": "Short answer\nOrthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus rose bodily from the dead — not as a mere disembodied “spirit creature,” but in a real, physical (though glorified) human body. This bodily resurrection is the historical and theological center of Christian faith: it vindicates Jesus’ identity and work, guarantees the future bodily resurrection of believers, and affirms the redemption of the whole human person (body and soul).\n\nWhat Jehovah’s Witnesses claim\nMany Jehovah’s Witnesses say that after Jesus’ death God disposed of his corpse and raised Jesus as a spirit being (i.e., not the same physical body he had before). That view treats the resurrection as a non-physical or purely spiritual raising.\n\nWhat orthodox Christianity teaches (essentials)\n- Jesus rose bodily on the third day. The tomb was empty and Jesus appeared in a real, recognizable body.\n- His resurrected body is the same human person and identity as the crucified Jesus (continuity), yet transformed/glorified (discontinuity)—no longer subject to death, decay, or ordinary physical limits.\n- The resurrection is historical (it actually happened) and saving: it vindicates Christ, establishes his victory over sin and death, and serves as the “firstfruits” and guarantee of believers’ future bodily resurrection.\n\nKey scriptural bases (representative)\n- Luke 24:36–43: Jesus shows his disciples “hands and feet” and invites them to touch him; he eats broiled fish in their presence.\n- John 20:24–29: Jesus invites Thomas to touch his wounds (“put your finger here”).\n- John 21:9–14: Jesus prepares and eats breakfast with the disciples after the resurrection.\n- Acts 1:3: Jesus “presented himself alive” after suffering by many convincing proofs, speaking about the kingdom.\n- 1 Corinthians 15:3–8, 12–22, 42–44: Paul treats the resurrection as apostolic proclamation (Christ “raised on the third day”), lists post-resurrection appearances, calls Christ the “firstfruits” and explains that the perishable body is raised imperishable; “there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.”\n- Romans 6:4; 8:11; Philippians 3:20–21: link Christ’s resurrection to believers’ future bodily transformation.\n\nHow “spiritual” must be understood\nThe New Testament sometimes uses language like “spiritual body” (1 Cor 15:44) and says Christ was “made alive in the spirit” (1 Pet 3:18). Orthodox reading understands these to mean that the resurrection body is animated and transformed by the Holy Spirit and no longer corruptible, not that the risen Jesus lacked a real body. The Greek word pneumatikos (“spiritual”) in 1 Cor 15 contrasts the empowered, transformed state with the ordinary “natural” body, not implying immateriality. Luke’s “a spirit does not have flesh and bones” (Luke 24:39) shows Jesus arguing against the notion that he is a mere disembodied ghost; he emphasizes the reality of his flesh-and-bones body.\n\nWhy this matters theologically\n- Incarnation and redemption: If God truly assumed human nature (incarnation), then the redemption must include the whole human person — body as well as soul. A merely spiritual resurrection undercuts the doctrine that the Word became flesh (John 1:14) and the final restoration of creation.\n- The hope of believers: The apostles’ promise to Christians is a bodily resurrection; if Christ himself did not rise bodily, that Christian hope would be undermined (Paul makes this explicit in 1 Cor 15).\n- Historical witness: The early church’s preaching, creeds, and the witness of the Gospels and apostles are oriented around a bodily resurrection. The creeds (e.g., the Apostles’ and Nicene Creeds) summarize this belief that Christ “rose again” (understood as bodily) and “ascended into heaven.”\n\nOrthodox response to the Jehovah’s Witness claim\n- The New Testament witnesses (Gospels, Acts, Paul) consistently report appearances that indicate a physical, embodied risen Jesus (eating, being touched, showing wounds).\n- Passages used to argue for a non-physical resurrection (e.g., “in the spirit,” “a spirit does not have flesh and bones”) do not support the idea that Jesus ceased to have a body; rather they describe the transformed, Spirit-empowered nature of the resurrection life and explicitly deny that he is a mere ghost.\n- Historically, denials of Jesus’ real bodily resurrection (and of his true humanity) echo ancient heresies such as docetism and are incompatible with orthodox Christology (the church’s teaching that the Son is truly God and truly human).\n\nA brief pastoral note\nBecause the bodily resurrection is central to Christian hope and worship, orthodox Christianity regards this as non-negotiable: Jesus’ real, bodily rising is both the proof of his victory and the pattern for the redeemed life of believers. Differences with Jehovah’s Witnesses on this point reflect deeper divergences over Christ’s person (e.g., deity, pre-existence) and the nature of salvation.\n\nIf you’d like, I can point to specific passages in a particular Bible translation, quote the early creeds, or sketch how church fathers (Ignatius, Irenaeus, Athanasius) argued for the bodily resurrection.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns closely with historic Christian orthodoxy: Jesus rose bodily from the dead in a real, physical (glorified) body; the resurrected Jesus shows continuity of personal identity with the crucified Christ while being transformed and incorruptible. It correctly treats ‘spiritual body’ as a transformed, Spirit-empowered embodiment rather than a purely immaterial existence, and it cites key scriptural bases (Luke 24:36–43; John 20:27; John 21:9–14; Acts 1:3; 1 Cor 15:3–8, 12–22, 42–44; Rom 6:4; 8:11; Phil 3:20–21; 1 Pet 3:18). It explicitly denies docetism and counters Jehovah’s Witness claims about a non-physical resurrection, while noting the historical and salvific significance of the bodily resurrection for believers. The text also offers a pastoral note and suggests further exploration, showing nuanced understanding of the topic. Minor points of debate exist among scholars (e.g., precise articulation of “same person” vs. transformed body, nuanced readings of 1 Cor 15:44 and 1 Pet 3:18), but these do not constitute doctrinal errors and are handled appropriately."
