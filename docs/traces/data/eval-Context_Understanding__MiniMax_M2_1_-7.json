            "The statement that parables 'test hearts' is not explicitly stated in Scripture; the text describes revelation to those who listen and judgment/rejection to those who don’t, rather than portraying parables as a formal 'test' of individuals."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM accurately reflects key biblical points: parables reveal truth to the receptive (Matt 13:11, 13:36-43), and they function as a judgment to the resistant by fulfilling Isaiah 6 (Matt 13:13-15). It correctly notes the use of familiar, memorable imagery (agricultural/domestic parables). The nuance about parables testing hearts is interpretive and should be presented as how responses to parables reveal the condition of hearers’ hearts rather than as a stated purpose of Jesus. A slightly deeper nuance could also acknowledge that Christ explains the meanings to His disciples (private explanation in Matthew 13:36-43) and that the parables serve to reveal mysteries of the kingdom to some while concealing them from others."
