    "expected": "Original sin is the doctrine that all humanity inherited a sinful nature from Adam's fall. As a result, all people are born with a inclination toward sin and are spiritually separated from God. This doesn't mean infants are guilty of actual sins, but that human nature is corrupted and inclined toward evil apart from God's grace.",
    "output": "### The Doctrine of Original Sin: A Biblical and Theological Explanation\n\nAs a systematic theologian, I'll provide a clear, accurate explanation of the doctrine of original sin, drawing primarily from Scripture and key historical developments in Christian thought. This doctrine is central to understanding human nature, sin, and the need for salvation in orthodox Christianity (encompassing Protestant, Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox traditions, though with some variations in emphasis). I'll ground it in the Bible while noting its theological implications.\n\n#### 1. **Definition and Core Concept**\nThe doctrine of original sin teaches that all humanity inherits a corrupted or fallen nature as a result of the first sin committed by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. This is not merely a bad example set by our ancestors but an inherited condition that affects every person from birth. It includes:\n- **A sinful inclination**: Humans are born with a natural tendency toward sin, rebellion against God, and moral corruption.\n- **Inherited guilt**: In many traditions (especially Western Christianity), this also involves a shared guilt or culpability for Adam's sin, as he acted as the representative head of the human race.\n\nIn essence, original sin explains why sin is universal—it's not just individual choices but a fundamental flaw in human nature passed down through generations. As the Westminster Confession of Faith (a key Protestant statement) puts it: \"They [Adam and Eve] being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed; and the same death in sin, and corrupted nature, conveyed to all their posterity descending from them by ordinary generation.\"\n\nThis doctrine contrasts with views like Pelagianism (condemned as heresy in the early Church), which denied inherited sin and claimed humans are born morally neutral and capable of perfection without divine grace.\n\n#### 2. **Biblical Foundation**\nThe doctrine is rooted in Scripture, particularly in the narratives of creation and fall, and elaborated in the New Testament. Key passages include:\n\n- **Genesis 3:1-19**: This describes the original sin itself. Adam and Eve, tempted by the serpent, disobeyed God's command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Their act introduced sin into the world, resulting in immediate consequences like shame, relational brokenness, and expulsion from Eden. God curses the ground and pronounces judgments, including pain, toil, and death, which affect all humanity (e.g., Genesis 3:16-19: \"In pain you shall bring forth children... cursed is the ground because of you\").\n\n- **Romans 5:12-21**: The Apostle Paul provides the most explicit New Testament exposition. He writes: \"Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned\" (Romans 5:12, ESV). Paul contrasts Adam (the \"one man\" through whom sin and death entered) with Christ (the \"one man\" through whom grace and life are offered). This passage emphasizes federal headship: Adam represents all humanity, so his sin imputes death and condemnation to us all. Paul further states, \"For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous\" (Romans 5:19).\n\n- **Psalm 51:5**: David confesses, \"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me\" (ESV), indicating that sinfulness is present from conception.\n\n- **Ephesians 2:1-3**: Paul describes humanity as \"dead in the trespasses and sins\" and \"by nature children of wrath\" (ESV), underscoring that this sinful state is innate, not just learned.\n\nOther supporting texts include Genesis 6:5 (\"The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually\") and Romans 3:23 (\"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\"), which affirm the universality of sin.\n\n#### 3. **Historical Development**\nThe doctrine was formalized in the early Church, particularly through the writings of Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD) in his debates against Pelagius. Augustine argued from Romans 5 that Adam's sin corrupted human nature, making grace essential for salvation. This view was affirmed at the Council of Orange (529 AD) and influenced major confessions:\n- **Catholic Tradition**: Emphasizes original sin as the loss of original holiness, transmitted through propagation (Catechism of the Catholic Church, §§ 396–409). Baptism is seen as removing the guilt but not fully eradicating the inclination to sin (concupiscence).\n- **Protestant Tradition** (e.g., Reformed and Lutheran): Stresses total depravity—humans are utterly unable to choose God without the Holy Spirit's enabling grace (e.g., John Calvin's *Institutes of the Christian Religion*).\n- **Eastern Orthodox Tradition**: Focuses more on ancestral sin as mortality and a weakened will, rather than inherited guilt, emphasizing theosis (deification) through Christ.\n\n#### 4. **Theological Implications**\n- **Human Condition**: Original sin explains why evil persists in the world—war, injustice, personal failings—and why no one is righteous by their own merit (Romans 3:10-12). It leads to total depravity (not that we're as bad as we could be, but that every part of us is affected by sin).\n- **Need for Salvation**: If sin is inherited and pervasive, humanity cannot save itself. Salvation requires God's initiative through Jesus Christ, who atones for sin and offers new life (Romans 5:18-19; 2 Corinthians 5:21). This ties into doctrines like justification by faith and sanctification.\n- **Hope and Restoration**: The doctrine is not pessimistic; it highlights God's grace. Through Christ, the \"second Adam,\" believers are regenerated, and the effects of original sin are ultimately overcome in the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:21-22).\n\nIn summary, original sin is the biblical teaching that Adam's rebellion introduced a hereditary corruption into all humanity, resulting in universal sinfulness and death, which only Christ's redemptive work can remedy. This doctrine underscores the gravity of sin while pointing to the greater glory of God's grace. If you'd like to explore related topics, such as its relation to free will or baptism, let me know!",

It cites key biblical texts (Genesis 3, Romans 5, Romans 3:23, Ephesians 2:1-3, Psalm 51:5) and acknowledges significant doctrinal differences among traditions, which demonstrates nuance. The main areas for tightening are a precise handling of specific confessional quotes (e.g., Westminster) and slightly more precise representation of differing positions on guilt, baptism, and grace across Catholic, Orthodox, and various Protestant theologies. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced, yielding a high score with minor caveats."
