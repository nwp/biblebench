    "expected": "Jehovah's Witnesses teach that only 144,000 people will go to heaven to rule with Christ, while other faithful JWs will live eternally on a paradise earth. They interpret Revelation 7:4 and 14:1 literally and exclusively. This contradicts orthodox Christian teaching in several ways: (1) Revelation 7 describes the 144,000 as specifically from the 12 tribes of Israel, symbolizing the fullness of God's people; (2) Revelation 7:9 immediately describes 'a great multitude that no one could count' before the throne - suggesting heaven isn't limited to 144,000; (3) Orthodox Christianity teaches all believers inherit eternal life in God's presence (John 14:2-3, Philippians 3:20, Revelation 21-22), not a two-tier system. This teaching creates an elite class and limits the hope of heaven.",
    "output": "## 1) What Jehovah’s Witnesses teach about the 144,000\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses (JWs) interpret the **144,000** in **Revelation 7:1–8** and **Revelation 14:1–5** as a **literal, limited number** of Christians who are specially “anointed” by God’s spirit.\n\nKey elements of their teaching:\n\n- **A literal number with a distinct role:** The 144,000 are understood as a definite group who will be **resurrected to heavenly life** to be **kings and priests with Christ** (cf. Rev. 5:9–10; 20:6).\n- **“Spiritual Israel”:** The “12 tribes” imagery is taken to refer, not to ethnic Israel, but to an “Israel of God” made up of these anointed Christians (cf. Gal. 6:16, as they interpret it).\n- **Two groups in Revelation 7:** JWs distinguish between:\n  - the **144,000** (Rev. 7:4) with a **heavenly** calling, and  \n  - the **“great crowd”** (Rev. 7:9–17), understood as a separate group with an **earthly** hope.\n\nHistorically, JWs taught that the heavenly calling was largely limited to Christians from the early church through 1935 (with some later additions). In practice today, they still maintain a **144,000 cap**, though the number of those who identify as “anointed” has fluctuated and increased in recent decades.\n\n## 2) How this affects their view of salvation and heaven\n\n### A. Two destinies (heavenly vs. earthly)\nThis is the major practical impact: JWs do not view “going to heaven” as the normal destiny of most saved people.\n\n- **The 144,000**: go to **heaven** to rule with Christ.\n- **The “great crowd” / “other sheep”** (linked to John 10:16 in JW teaching): are saved to live forever on a **restored paradise earth**, under Christ’s Kingdom government.\n\nSo, in JW theology, “salvation” commonly means:\n- either **heavenly life** (for the anointed 144,000), or\n- **everlasting life on earth** (for the majority of faithful JWs).\n\n### B. “Born again” and the New Covenant\nJWs typically reserve language like **“born again”** (John 3:3–5) and **being in the New Covenant** primarily for the 144,000 anointed class, not for all believers. The “great crowd” benefits from Christ’s ransom and Kingdom rule, but is not usually described as being “born again” in the same sense.\n\n### C. Worship practice: the Memorial\nAt the annual **Memorial of Christ’s death** (their observance corresponding to the Lord’s Supper), only those who believe they are of the **anointed 144,000** partake of the bread and wine. Most attendees do not partake, because they understand themselves to have the earthly hope, not the heavenly calling.\n\n### D. Mediation language\nTraditionally, JW publications have taught that Jesus is **Mediator of the New Covenant** in a direct sense for the anointed, while the “great crowd” benefits indirectly through that arrangement. This differs from how most Christians understand Christ’s mediation as applying equally to all who belong to him (see comparison below).\n\n## 3) Relation to orthodox Christian theology (agreements and departures)\n\n### Areas of agreement (partial but real)\nOrthodox Christians can recognize some points of overlap, even though the overall framework differs:\n\n- **Christ will reign** and God will fully establish his Kingdom (Rev. 11:15).\n- **A future resurrection** and final restoration of God’s purposes are central (though JWs and orthodox Christians differ on details like the nature of the soul, final judgment, and intermediate state).\n- Revelation uses vivid imagery to describe God’s triumph and the vindication of his people.\n\n### Major departures from orthodox Christian theology\nOrthodox Christianity (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestant traditions) generally departs from JW teaching on the 144,000 in several connected ways:\n\n#### A. One people of God with one saving hope in Christ\nOrthodox theology typically holds that **all who are in Christ** share fundamentally the same salvation: adoption as God’s children, union with Christ, and the indwelling Spirit (Rom. 8:9–17; Eph. 4:4–6). While Christians may have different rewards or callings, orthodox theology does not usually divide believers into **two separate classes** with two different ultimate destinies (heavenly rulers vs. earthly citizens) as a defining feature of salvation.\n\n#### B. The 144,000 are usually read symbolically (or at least not as a second-tier schema)\nMany orthodox interpreters view the 144,000 as:\n- **symbolic** (12×12×1000) for the fullness of God’s redeemed people, or\n- a symbolic representation of the faithful, often connected typologically to Israel and the church,\nrather than a literal cap on the number of people who go to heaven.\n\nEven among Christians who take some numbers in Revelation seriously, the idea that Revelation intends a permanent two-track salvation system is generally not seen as consistent with the broader New Testament witness.\n\n#### C. New Covenant and Communion\nOrthodox Christianity generally teaches:\n- The **New Covenant** is for **all Christians** (Luke 22:20; 2 Cor. 3; Heb. 8–10).\n- The Lord’s Supper/Eucharist is a covenantal participation for the whole church (1 Cor. 10:16–17; 11:23–26), not restricted to a small subset.\n\n#### D. Heaven and the final state\nClassic Christianity often emphasizes that the ultimate hope is **resurrection and the renewal of creation** (“new heavens and new earth,” Rev. 21–22), and that believers’ final blessedness is communion with God. There is diversity in how Christians describe “heaven” in relation to the renewed earth, but not usually in the JW sense that *most saved people will never be destined for heaven at all*.\n\n## 4) Bottom-line summary\nJehovah’s Witnesses teach that the **144,000** in Revelation are a **literal, limited group** of “anointed” Christians who will go to **heaven** to rule with Christ. The vast majority of faithful JWs expect salvation as everlasting life on a **paradise earth**. This produces a distinct **two-class structure** (heavenly vs. earthly hope) that shapes their understanding of being “born again,” the New Covenant, and who partakes at the Memorial.\n\nOrthodox Christian theology generally **does not** accept this two-tier framework and more commonly reads Revelation’s 144,000 as **symbolic** (or at least not a restrictive heavenly quota) and holds that **all believers share one covenantal salvation and one hope in Christ**, expressed in a unified church and sacramental life.\n\nIf you want, I can also (1) walk through Revelation 7 and 14 in detail to show why JWs read it this way, and (2) summarize the most common orthodox interpretations of the “great crowd.”",
