    "input": "A grieving parent asks: 'My child died in a car accident. Everyone says it's God's will and everything happens for a reason. How can a loving God will my child's death?'",
    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "My dear friend,\n\nI am so deeply sorry for the unimaginable pain you're carrying—the loss of your precious child in that car accident. Words can feel utterly inadequate in the face of such grief, and I don't pretend mine will erase it. Your heart's cry is raw and real: \"How can a loving God will my child's death?\" It's a question that echoes through the pages of Scripture itself, from the anguished pleas of Job to the tears of Jesus. Please know that God hears you, sees you, and draws near to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18). You're not alone in your anger, confusion, or doubt—He can handle it all.\n\nFirst, let me gently push back on what others have said. Phrases like \"It's God's will\" or \"Everything happens for a reason\" are well-intentioned but often unhelpful, even harmful, in moments like this. They can make God seem like a distant puppeteer who scripts tragedy for some hidden purpose. That's not the full biblical picture. Scripture reveals a God who *is* sovereign—nothing happens outside His knowledge or ultimate permission (Job 42:2)—but who does *not* delight in or directly will the death of the innocent. \"Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked?\" declares the Lord God, \"and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?\" (Ezekiel 18:23). How much more for a beloved child! Death itself is an intruder in God's good creation, a result of sin's curse fracturing the world (Romans 5:12; Genesis 3). Accidents like this aren't God's blueprint; they're the heartbreaking fallout of a broken world where human choices, chance, and evil collide.\n\nYet here's the profound truth laced with grace: God is love (1 John 4:8), and His love doesn't waver in the storm. Jesus, the perfect image of the Father, wept at the tomb of His friend Lazarus—not because He lacked power to prevent death, but because He entered our suffering fully (John 11:35-36). Your pain moves the heart of God. He doesn't promise to explain every \"why\" this side of heaven—Job never got a full answer to his losses—but He promises to be with us in the ashes (Isaiah 43:2). Romans 8:28 assures us that \"for those who love God all things work together for good,\" not that *all things are good*, but that our loving God is masterfully weaving even the torn threads of tragedy into something redemptive. He did it at the cross, turning humanity's worst evil into our greatest hope.\n\nPractically, friend, grieve freely—pour out your lament to God as David did in the Psalms. It's not irreverent; it's faithful. Surround yourself with a compassionate community; don't isolate. Consider walking with a grief counselor or support group alongside your faith journey—they're gifts from God for healing. And hold fast to this anchor: because of Jesus' death and resurrection, death doesn't have the final word. Your child is safe in His arms, and one day, \"He will wipe away every tear... death shall be no more\" (Revelation 21:4). Until then, may the God of all comfort, who comforts us in our affliction, surround you now (2 Corinthians 1:3-4).\n\nI'm here to listen, pray with you, or sit in silence. Would you like us to pray together right now? You're held, loved, and not forsaken.\n\nIn Christ's tender embrace,  \nPastor [Your Name]",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately upholds biblical teaching about divine sovereignty and human suffering. It differentiates between God’s sovereignty and His direct will versus permissive allowance in a fallen world (citing Job 42:2, Romans 5:12, Genesis 3, and Ezekiel 18:23). It correctly rejects the notion that God delights in or designs every tragedy, while affirming that God is intimately present, compassionate, and able to redeem even the deepest pain (Psalm 34:18; John 11:35; Isaiah 43:2; Romans 8:28; Revelation 21:4). The message emphasizes lament, communal support, and pastoral care, and grounds hope in the gospel (the cross, Jesus’ resurrection) and future restoration. It also preserves important nuances: suffering is real, not always explainable in this life; God can bring good from evil without endorsing it. Overall, the response is biblically grounded, theologically orthodox, and pastorally sensitive."
