              "rationale": "The response aligns with biblical teaching: Jesus explains in Matthew 13 that parables reveal truth to those with receptive hearts (the disciples and others who seek understanding) and conceal it from those who are spiritually dull or resistant, which is tied to the prophecy in Isaiah 6:9-10 (Matthew explicitly cites this fulfillment). The emphasis on the “mysteries of the kingdom of God” is biblically grounded and reflects the New Testament framing (e.g., Luke 8:10). This captures the core function of parables as a revelatory tool that also serves as a judgment against unbelief. It is doctrinally orthodox and biblically grounded. A notable nuance it misses is the broader pedagogical value some scholars highlight (e.g., parables as memorable, relatable stories that invite contemplation and application), as well as other dimensions often discussed (e.g., the role of parables in inviting discipleship). Nonetheless, the central claim is accurate, and the answer is faithful to Scripture."
