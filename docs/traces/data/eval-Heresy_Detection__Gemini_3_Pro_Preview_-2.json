    "input": "A preacher claims: 'Salvation is achieved through good works and moral living. If you live a good life, you will earn your way to heaven.' Is this biblical teaching?",
    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "Based on the theological tenets of historic orthodox Christianity, the statement provided by the preacher is **heretical**. It represents a fundamental error regarding the doctrine of Soteriology (the theology of salvation).\n\nSpecifically, this teaching aligns with the ancient heresy known as **Pelagianism**, or strictly speaking, **Works-Righteousness (Legalism)**.\n\nHere is a detailed theological analysis of why this statement is rejected by orthodox Christianity.\n\n### 1. Theological Diagnosis: Pelagianism\nIn the early 5th century, a British monk named Pelagius taught that human beings possess the natural ability to fulfill God's commands and live a sinless life without the aid of Divine Grace. He argued that human nature was not corrupted by Adam's fall (Original Sin) and that individuals could earn eternal life through their own moral efforts.\n\nThe preacher’s claim that one can \"earn your way to heaven\" through a \"good life\" mirrors this view. This teaching was condemned as heresy at the **Council of Carthage (418 AD)** and the **Council of Ephesus (431 AD)**.\n\nOrthodox Christian doctrine holds that due to the Fall, the human will is corrupted (Total Depravity) and incapable of achieving the perfect holiness required by God without the intervention of grace (see Augustine vs. Pelagius).\n\n### 2. Biblical Rebuttal\nThe Bible consistently teaches that salvation is a gift from God (Grace), received through trust in Jesus Christ (Faith), not a wage paid for human effort.\n\n*   **Ephesians 2:8-9:** \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—**not by works**, so that no one can boast.\" \n    *   *Analysis:* This is the definitive rebuttal. If salvation could be earned, it would no longer be a gift; it would be a debt God owed to humanity.\n*   **Romans 3:23-24:** \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.\"\n    *   *Analysis:* Biblical anthropology asserts that no one lives a \"good life\" by God's perfect standard. All fall short; therefore, justification must be free (unearned) or it is impossible.\n*   **Galatians 2:16:** \"...know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified.\"\n*   **Romans 4:4-5:** \"Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness.\"\n\n### 3. The Distinction Between \"Root\" and \"Fruit\"\nThe preacher's error is a confusion of cause and effect. Historic Christianity (including Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox traditions) teaches that good works are necessary, but they function differently than the preacher suggests:\n\n*   **The Heresy (The Preacher's view):** Good Works $\\rightarrow$ Salvation. (Works form the *basis* or purchase price of entry to heaven).\n*   **The Orthodox View:** Grace + Faith $\\rightarrow$ Salvation $\\rightarrow$ Good Works. (Works are the *result* or *evidence* of a saved life, not the cause).\n\nWhile the Epistle of James (2:26) states that \"faith without works is dead,\" this is historically interpreted to mean that genuine saving faith inevitably produces a changed life and moral behavior (Sanctification). It does **not** mean that those works accrue merit that forces God to grant entrance to heaven.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement \"If you live a good life, you will earn your way to heaven\" is **not biblical teaching**.\n\nIt renders the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ unnecessary (Galatians 2:21: \"I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!\"). If humans could earn heaven by being moral, they would not need a Savior; they would only need a moral example. Christian doctrine stands on the premise that mankind cannot save itself, and salvation is found strictly in the merit of Christ, imputed to the believer by grace.",

            "Historical claim: The response states that the Council of Ephesus (431 AD) condemned Pelagianism. In fact, Pelagianism was condemned earlier by the Synods at Carthage (circa 411–418 AD) and later reaffirmed by other church fathers and councils; Ephesus primarily addressed Nestorianism. This is a factual inaccuracy about church history.",
            "Terminology nuance: The response labels orthodox positions as embracing “Total Depravity,” a term most associated with Reformed theology. While Augustinean/Western traditions affirm human fallenness and the necessity of grace, the East (Orthodox) and Catholic traditions do not typically frame it using the Reformed category of “Total Depravity.” This is a nuanced distinction that could be clarified to avoid implying uniform use of that label across all orthodox groups."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM's answer is largely accurate in its core doctrinal claims: salvation is by grace through faith, not by works; good works are evidence of genuine faith and sanctification, not the basis of justification; key Scriptural supports are correctly cited. It correctly identifies the preacher’s teaching as Pelagian/works-righteousness. However, there is an historical inaccuracy about the Council of Ephesus condemning Pelagianism, and it leans on a Reformed term (“Total Depravity”) that is not uniformly used across all orthodox traditions. These issues affect precision but not the overall doctrinal direction. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded, with good nuance on root vs. fruit and the role of works."
