            "1 John 5:7 is a contested text in modern manuscript evidence. The Comma Johanneum ('three that bear record in heaven… the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost') appears only in later manuscripts and is not present in the earliest Greek texts. While orthodox Trinitarian doctrine is supported by 1 John 5:7-8 in traditional Bible translations, modern critical editions often omit the Comma. The response would be strengthened by acknowledging this textual issue and not presenting 1 John 5:7 as a universally attested proof-text for the Trinity."

          "rationale": "The response accurately identifies modalism as heresy and correctly describes the orthodox three-person/one-substance doctrine, along with biblical examples commonly cited in support (baptism narrative, John 17) and historical rejection by the early church. The main caveat is the treatment of 1 John 5:7 as a clear, uncontested scriptural proof for the Trinity; in light of manuscript evidence, this claim is oversimplified. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound and nuanced, with a minor, fixable biblical textual note."
