            "Historical specifics about condemnation of modalism are imprecise: the LLM attributes a condemnation to Pope Callixtus I (~220 AD) and Sabellius' excommunication around that time. Early church condemnation came primarily from patristic writers (e.g., Hippolytus, Tertullian) and later ecumenical councils (notably Constantinople I, 381). The exact dating and papal involvement are debated in scholarship."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies modalism (Sabellianism) as a heresy and argues from Scripture (e.g., Jesus’ baptism, Jesus praying to the Father) to affirm the orthodox view of three co-eternal, distinct Persons. It also correctly notes the orthodox position on the Trinity (one God in three Persons who are co-equal and co-eternal). The nuances about the eternal relations of origin and the distinction between the economic/immanent Trinity are captured. The main strength is doctrinal accuracy and scriptural grounding; the minor shortcoming is historical specifics, which are not central to the theological point and could be stated with more scholarly caution."
