          "rationale": "The LLM answer accurately identifies Chronicles as parallel to Kings and as supplementing that history, with an emphasis on temple, priesthood, and the David/Judah focus. It correctly highlights themes of divine faithfulness and repentance, which align with Chronicles’ theological framing, and it implicitly reflects the emphasis on covenant through the Davidic line. Minor caveats: Chronicles foregrounds the Davidic covenant and temple worship more explicitly and often reframes or omits certain northern-kingdom material found in Kings; it also includes extensive genealogies and begins with Adam to David, before focusing on Judah’s kings, which the response does not mention. The statement ‘from David to the exile’ is a simplification of Chronicles’ scope but not doctrinally harmful. Overall, the assessment is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and captures essential nuance with only minor gaps."
