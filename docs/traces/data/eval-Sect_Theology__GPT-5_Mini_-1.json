    "input": "Someone says they believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as taught in the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price alongside the Bible. How does this differ from historic Christian teaching?",
    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "Short answer: There is substantial agreement (Latter‑day Saints affirm the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit and center faith on Jesus as Savior), but on some of the most basic questions about who God is and how the three “persons” relate, Latter‑day Saint (LDS/Mormon) teaching as taught in the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants (D&C), and Pearl of Great Price departs in important ways from historic, creedal Christianity (the Nicene/Chalcedonian tradition found across Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestant churches).\n\nWhat LDS sources teach (summary)\n- The Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Ghost are three distinct personages. Joseph Smith’s First Vision (in the Pearl of Great Price, Joseph Smith—History) and the Book of Mormon episode in 3 Nephi 11 are commonly appealed to for this.  \n- These personages are understood as united in purpose and will rather than as a single metaphysical substance. The Lectures on Faith (early Latter‑day Saint teaching) and later D&C passages emphasize “one in purpose.”  \n- The Father and the Son have glorified, tangible, resurrected bodies of flesh and bones; the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit (D&C 130:22; Book of Mormon accounts of Christ’s physical appearance in 3 Nephi).  \n- God the Father was once as man is now and progressed to godhood; faithful humans can likewise be exalted to become like God (the doctrine of exaltation/theosis in an LDS sense). Some LDS teaching includes the idea of a plurality of gods (Gods in a literal sense), though official formulations vary.  \n- New revelation (modern prophets and LDS scriptures) is authoritative and is used to define doctrine alongside the Bible (Articles of Faith 1:8 and many passages in the D&C).\n\nHow that contrasts with historic Christian (creedal) teaching\n- Unity of being (ousia) vs. unity of purpose: Historic Christianity (as summarized in the Nicene Creed and later theology) teaches one God in three persons (one divine essence or substance—homoousios—shared by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). The three persons are distinct but consubstantial, coeternal, coequal. LDS teaching rejects the creed’s metaphysical formulation and says the three are distinct beings united in purpose — a fundamentally different ontology. Many orthodox Christians therefore describe LDS doctrine as non‑Trinitarian.  \n- Nature of God’s being: Classical Christian doctrine affirms that God is spirit (John 4:24), immutable and uncreated, not a material body. The Incarnation is unique: the Second Person of the Trinity took a human nature in the person of Jesus while remaining fully God. LDS teaching that the Father has a body of flesh and bones (and that God was once a man who progressed) is a clear departure from the classical view of God’s immaterial, unchangeable, uniquely divine nature.  \n- Eternity and origin of the Son: In Nicene theology the Son is eternally begotten of the Father (no beginning of His divine personhood) and is not a created being. While LDS teaching strongly honors Jesus and regards Him as divine and pre‑mortal, there are important differences in how His origin and relationship to the Father are described (e.g., emphasis on literal sonship, premortal spirit existence as one of many spirit children of the Father). This has led many orthodox theologians to see LDS Christology as different from the Nicene doctrine of eternal generation.  \n- Theosis/exaltation: Eastern Orthodoxy speaks of theosis as participation in God’s divine life by grace (without becoming God by nature). LDS exaltation often speaks of becoming “like God” in a more literal and ontological sense (including language about inheriting “all that the Father has”), and some historical LDS statements even imply the possibility of becoming a god who creates worlds. That differs both in emphasis and in metaphysical implications from classical theosis.  \n- Authority and sources: Historic Christianity has held the Bible as the canonical norm interpreted within the tradition shaped by the ecumenical councils and creeds. LDS theology gives canonical status to the Book of Mormon, the D&C, and the Pearl of Great Price and to continuing prophetic revelation — a different basis for doctrine and for defining God’s nature.\n\nAreas of genuine agreement\n- Central Christian convictions shared by both: there is a Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer who lived, died and rose again, and the Holy Spirit acts in the world. Prayer, worship, repentance, and moral transformation centered on Christ are central in both.  \n- Rejection of modalism and explicit denial of Jesus’ historical reality are not characteristic of LDS teaching; Latter‑day Saints affirm Jesus’ distinct personhood and historic incarnation.\n\nHow historic churches typically classify LDS teaching\n- Because the Nicene doctrine of God is a defining boundary of historic orthodoxy, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestant theologians classify mainstream LDS teaching as outside historic Christian orthodoxy (i.e., non‑Trinitarian, and therefore heterodox). Some scholars prefer more neutral language (e.g., “another form of Christianity”); others call it a distinct religion. The reasons are primarily doctrinal (God’s nature, Trinity, revelation, soteriology), not merely differences of emphasis.\n\nRespectful summary\n- If someone says “I believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as taught in LDS scriptures alongside the Bible,” they are clearly within the Latter‑day Saint theological tradition and share important commitments to Christ and the work of the Spirit. However, because historic Christianity’s creedal formulations define the doctrine of the Trinity in very specific metaphysical terms (one God in three consubstantial persons, immaterial Father, incarnate Son uniquely uncreated as God, Holy Spirit fully God), the LDS description of three distinct personages, God’s embodied nature, the doctrine of exaltation, and reliance on modern scripture and prophets mark substantial departures from Nicene, Chalcedonian, and post‑Nicene orthodox teaching.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Give specific scriptural passages in LDS and creedal texts for side‑by‑side comparison (e.g., D&C 130:22, 3 Nephi 11; Nicene Creed clauses); or  \n- Explain how particular historic churches (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant) have assessed LDS theology in official statements.",

          "rationale": "The response accurately identifies major doctrinal divergences between LDS theology and historic orthodox Christianity (Trinity as one essence vs. three distinct beings in LDS view, additional scriptures as canonical alongside the Bible, embodied God the Father, etc.). It also notes areas of overlap (Christology, piety toward Jesus, the Spirit’s role) and the general stance of mainstream churches toward LDS theology. Some claims about official LDS positions are nuanced and contested within LDS history (progression to godhood, the exact status of the Godhead and 'three distinct personages,' and the canonical status of Lectures on Faith). These deserve careful qualification to avoid overgeneralization. Overall, the answer is accurate and nuanced, but could be tightened with precise, current LDS doctrinal positions and canonical status."
