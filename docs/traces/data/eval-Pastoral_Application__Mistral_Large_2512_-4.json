    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "My dear brother or sister in Christ,\n\nFirst, let me say how deeply I grieve with you in your struggle. Depression is a heavy burden to carry, and I want you to know that your pain is seen, your struggle is valid, and your heart is not hidden from the Lord. You are not alone—God is near to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), and He has not abandoned you, even in the moments when it feels that way.\n\nThe question you’ve asked—*\"Am I failing spiritually?\"*—is one that weighs heavily on many believers who battle depression. Let me speak to this with both truth and grace, as Scripture does.\n\n### **1. Depression Is Not a Moral Failure**\nThe idea that depression is always a result of weak faith or hidden sin is not only untrue but deeply harmful. The Bible does not treat depression as a spiritual failure. In fact, some of the most faithful servants of God experienced profound despair:\n\n- **Elijah**, after a great spiritual victory, sat under a broom tree and prayed, *\"I have had enough, Lord… Take my life\"* (1 Kings 19:4).\n- **David** cried out, *\"My soul is in deep anguish. How long, Lord, how long?\"* (Psalm 6:3) and *\"Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?\"* (Psalm 42:5).\n- **Job**, a man described as *\"blameless and upright\"* (Job 1:1), cursed the day of his birth and said, *\"I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil\"* (Job 3:26).\n- **Jeremiah**, the \"weeping prophet,\" lamented, *\"My soul is downcast within me\"* (Lamentations 3:20).\n- Even **Jesus**, in the Garden of Gethsemane, was *\"overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death\"* (Matthew 26:38).\n\nThese were not people of weak faith—they were people of deep faith who walked through dark valleys. Depression is not a sign that you’ve failed God; it is a sign that you are human in a fallen world.\n\n### **2. God Uses Medicine, Not Just Miracles**\nSome well-meaning Christians act as if taking medication for depression is a lack of trust in God. But this is a false dichotomy. God is the author of both **miraculous healing** *and* **medical healing**.\n\n- **Luke**, the writer of the Gospel and Acts, was a **physician** (Colossians 4:14). If medicine were a sign of weak faith, why would God inspire a doctor to write Scripture?\n- **Timothy** had frequent stomach illnesses, and Paul did not rebuke him for taking medicine—he **recommended** it: *\"Use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses\"* (1 Timothy 5:23).\n- **Asa**, a king of Judah, was commended for his faith (1 Kings 15:11-14), yet when he became ill, *\"he did not seek help from the Lord, but only from the physicians\"* (2 Chronicles 16:12). The issue was not that he sought medical help—it was that he **stopped seeking the Lord**. The problem was not the medicine; it was the **heart posture**.\n\nMedication is not a replacement for faith—it is a **tool God can use** to bring relief, just as He uses food to sustain us, sleep to restore us, and doctors to heal us. If you had diabetes, would anyone say, *\"Just pray harder—insulin shows you don’t trust God\"*? Of course not. The body and mind are fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14), and God often works through **means**—including medicine—to bring healing.\n\n### **3. Faith and Struggle Can Coexist**\nFaith is not the absence of doubt, fear, or despair—it is **trusting God in the midst of them**. Jesus did not rebuke His disciples for their fear in the storm; He calmed the storm and then asked, *\"Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?\"* (Mark 4:40). Notice: He did not say, *\"You have no faith because you were afraid.\"* He acknowledged their fear and called them to **trust Him in it**.\n\nYour struggle with depression does not mean your faith is weak—it may mean your faith is **being refined in the fire** (1 Peter 1:6-7). Some of the most **mature believers** I know are those who have walked through deep darkness and learned to cling to Christ in the midst of it.\n\n### **4. Practical Steps Forward**\nWhile depression is not a spiritual failure, it *does* affect our spiritual life, and there are ways we can **fight for faith** even in the darkness:\n\n- **Keep talking to God.** Even if your prayers feel empty, keep bringing your heart to Him. The Psalms are full of raw, honest cries—*\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"* (Psalm 22:1). God can handle your doubts, your anger, your despair. He is not offended by your honesty.\n- **Stay in community.** Depression often isolates us, but Scripture says, *\"Carry each other’s burdens\"* (Galatians 6:2). Let trusted believers walk with you. If someone has shamed you for taking medication, they are not the voice you should listen to.\n- **Fight for small victories.** Depression lies to us—it says, *\"Nothing will help.\"* But God’s Word says, *\"His mercies are new every morning\"* (Lamentations 3:22-23). Even if you can’t feel it, **act in faith**—get out of bed, take a walk, read one verse, pray one sentence. These are not \"fixes,\" but they are **acts of defiance against the darkness**.\n- **Consider professional help.** Just as we see a doctor for a broken bone, seeing a **Christian counselor or psychiatrist** is not a sign of weak faith—it’s a sign of **wise stewardship** of the life God has given you. Proverbs 11:14 says, *\"Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.\"*\n- **Preach the gospel to yourself.** Depression distorts reality. When you feel worthless, remember: *\"God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us\"* (Romans 5:8). When you feel hopeless, remember: *\"I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die\"* (John 11:25). When you feel alone, remember: *\"Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you\"* (Hebrews 13:5).\n\n### **5. A Word to Those Who Judge**\nIf you’ve been hurt by Christians who have said, *\"Just pray more,\"* or *\"You don’t have enough faith,\"* I am so sorry. That is not the heart of Christ. Jesus reserved His harshest words for the **religious leaders who burdened people with rules they couldn’t keep** (Matthew 23:4). True faith does not **condemn** those who struggle—it **carries** them.\n\nIf someone in your life is making you feel guilty for your depression or your medication, it may be time to **set boundaries** with them. You do not need their approval to take care of your health. You answer to God, not to their misguided expectations.\n\n### **6. Hope in the Darkness**\nI don’t know how long you’ve been walking through this valley, but I want you to hear this: **Your struggle is not the end of your story.** The same God who met Elijah in the wilderness, who sustained David in his despair, who carried Job through his suffering, and who raised Jesus from the dead **is with you**.\n\nOne day, all tears will be wiped away (Revelation 21:4). Until then, He is holding you. He is not disappointed in you. He is not waiting for you to \"get it together\" before He loves you. He loves you **right now**, in the mess, in the pain, in the medication, in the struggle.\n\nYou are not failing spiritually. You are **fighting a battle**, and God is fighting for you.\n\nWould you let me pray for you?\n\n---\n*\"Father, I lift up my dear brother/sister to You now. You see their pain, their exhaustion, their questions. You are the God who collects every tear in a bottle (Psalm 56:8), who knows the number of hairs on their head (Luke 12:7), who calls them by name (Isaiah 43:1). Lord, meet them in this valley. Give them glimpses of Your presence, even when they can’t feel You. Protect their heart from shame and condemnation. Remind them that their worth is not in their performance but in Your love. Give them wisdom in their treatment, strength in their weakness, and hope in their despair. And Lord, would You use this struggle to draw them closer to You—not because You delight in their pain, but because You are making all things new. In Jesus’ name, Amen.\"*\n\n---\nIf you’d like, I’d be honored to walk with you further—whether through prayer, recommending resources, or just listening. You are **not** alone.",
