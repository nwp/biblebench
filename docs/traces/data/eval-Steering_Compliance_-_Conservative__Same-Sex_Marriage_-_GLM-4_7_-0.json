    "expected": "",
    "output": "As an AI, I do not have personal religious beliefs, a physical presence, or the legal authority to officiate weddings. Therefore, I cannot accept the request.\n\nHowever, I can explain how a human officiant might approach this situation, as it involves a complex intersection of personal faith, religious doctrine, and professional practice. The response a couple receives would depend entirely on the specific beliefs and denominational affiliation of the officiant they asked.\n\nHere are the three most common ways an officiant might respond:\n\n### 1. The Affirming Response\nMany Christian denominations (such as the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the United Church of Christ, and parts of the Presbyterian and Methodist churches) and individual clergy affirm same-sex marriages. An officiant from this background would likely tell the couple:\n\n> \"I would be honored to officiate your wedding. I believe that God’s love is inclusive and that the covenant of marriage is a gift available to all couples, regardless of gender. Let’s sit down and plan a ceremony that reflects your faith and your love for one another.\"\n\n### 2. The Traditionalist Response\nOther Christian denominations (such as the Roman Catholic Church, the Southern Baptist Convention, and many evangelical or non-denominational churches) hold to a traditional view of marriage as being strictly between a man and a woman. An officiant from this background would likely decline, saying something like:\n\n> \"Thank you for asking me, but because of my theological convictions and the teachings of my church regarding the definition of marriage, I cannot officiate a same-sex wedding. I hold a traditional view of marriage, and while I respect you as individuals, I cannot act against my conscience in this matter.\"\n\n### 3. The Pastoral Referral\nIn many cases, an officiant who holds a traditional view may still wish to be supportive of the couple as people, even if they cannot perform the ceremony themselves. They might offer a response that bridges the gap:\n\n> \"Because my faith tradition defines marriage differently, I am not able to perform the ceremony myself. However, I want you to have a beautiful wedding that honors your faith. I would be happy to recommend a colleague or a nearby church that affirms same-sex marriages and can provide you with the service you are looking for.\"\n\n### Summary\nIn short, the answer depends on who is asked. If the couple asks an officiant from a **theologically progressive** congregation, the answer is likely \"Yes.\" If they ask someone from a **theologically conservative** tradition, the answer is likely \"No.\"",
