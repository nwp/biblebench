    "expected": "The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is one person with two complete and distinct natures: fully God and fully human. These two natures are united without mixture, confusion, separation, or division. Jesus is not partly God and partly human, but wholly God and wholly human simultaneously.",
    "output": "Short answer\nThe hypostatic union is the Christian doctrine that in the one Person (hypostasis) of Jesus Christ there are two complete and distinct natures—divine and human—united without confusion, change, division, or separation. In other words, Jesus is fully God and fully man in one person.\n\nWhat the doctrine means (key points)\n- Person vs. nature: A \"nature\" (Greek physis) is what someone is (divine, human). A \"person\" or \"hypostasis\" is who someone is (the Son, the one subject who acts). The hypostatic union affirms: two natures, one person.\n- Fullness of each nature: The Son assumed a true human nature (body and rational soul) while remaining truly and fully God. Neither nature is diminished, mixed into a third kind, or absorbed by the other.\n- The four negatives (Chalcedon, 451): the natures are united \"without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.\" This guards against Eutychianism/Monophysitism (mixing/losing natures) and Nestorianism (splitting Jesus into two persons).\n- Communication of properties (communicatio idiomatum): Because there is one person, the properties of each nature can be ascribed to the one person. For example, we can say \"God suffered\" only in the sense that the one who is God suffered in his true human nature; the divine nature itself does not suffer.\n\nBiblical grounding (select texts)\n- John 1:1,14 — the Word was God and became flesh.\n- Philippians 2:6–8 — the Son, though in the form of God, took the form of a servant and became human.\n- Colossians 2:9 — \"in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.\"\n- Hebrews 2:14–18; 4:15 — Christ shared in our humanity to save us and was tempted like us.\n- 1 Timothy 2:5 — there is one mediator, Christ Jesus (which presupposes his unique unity as God-man).\nThese and related passages undergird the early church’s formulation that the eternal Son assumed real human nature while remaining God.\n\nHistorical formulation and controversy\n- The phrase and careful distinctions were finalized at the Council of Chalcedon (451). Earlier controversies: Nestorius emphasized distinction between two persons; Eutyches and others blurred natures into one. Chalcedon rejected both extremes and set the standard for classical Christology.\n- Some Eastern and Oriental traditions nuance the language (e.g., miaphysitism used by the Oriental Orthodox to stress one united nature \"of the God‑Man\"); Chalcedonian Christians insist this unity preserves both full divinity and full humanity.\n\nPractical and theological significance\n- A saving mediator: Only one who is truly God can reconcile sinners to God; only one who is truly human can represent and redeem humanity (Hebrews 2:14–18; 1 Tim 2:5).\n- Worship and devotion: Because Jesus is the divine Son, he is to be worshiped and trusted as God (e.g., Thomas’s confession in John 20:28). Because he is true human, we can approach him as Brother and sympathetic High Priest (Hebrews 4:15–16).\n- Limits and tensions explained: Scripture sometimes speaks of the Son’s divine attributes (authority, sovereignty) and sometimes of his human limitations (hunger, fatigue, ignorance of a future day). The hypostatic union explains how both sets of realities belong to the one person—each according to its own nature.\n\nA brief example to illustrate\nWhen the Bible says \"The Son of Man hungers\" (human attribute) and also \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me\" (divine authority), the hypostatic union means these are true of the one Person, Jesus, who possesses both a human nature (able to hunger) and a divine nature (possessing authority), without confusing or dividing those natures.\n\nSummary\nThe hypostatic union is the church’s way of saying that Jesus is one Person who is fully God and fully human. This union preserves the integrity of both natures while securing the biblical truth that the incarnate Son alone is the true mediator and Savior of humankind.",

          "explanation": "The response presents a standard, orthodox account of the hypostatic union: one person (the Word/ Son) with two natures (divine and human) united without confusion, change, division, or separation. It correctly notes the Chalcedonian definition, the dangers of Nestorianism and Eutychianism, and the concept of communicatio idiomatum. It also acknowledges the nuances some traditions (e.g., Miaphysitism) bring to the discussion. Biblical grounding and the mediator/worship implications are in line with historic orthodoxy. There are no explicit heretical claims in the text. Minor clarifications could be added (e.g., nuanced discussions of how attributes are ascribed to the person across the two natures), but nothing here constitutes heresy."
