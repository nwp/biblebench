    "expected": "This is Gnosticism, an ancient heresy. It contradicts Christianity in multiple ways: Christianity teaches salvation through faith in Christ's public work (not secret knowledge), affirms the goodness of God's material creation (Genesis 1), and proclaims resurrection of the body (not escape from physicality). Gnosticism was explicitly condemned by early church fathers and the New Testament writings (especially 1 John and Colossians).",
    "output": "Verdict: Heresy — this is classic Gnosticism, not orthodox Christian teaching.\n\nWhy:\n- Secret knowledge vs. apostolic revelation. Gnosticism claims salvation comes by an esoteric \"gnosis\" available only to an elite. Historic Christianity teaches that God has revealed himself publicly in Scripture, in the person and work of Jesus Christ, and through the apostolic witness. The gospel is proclaimed openly for all to hear and receive (e.g., Romans 10; the apostles’ preaching). Paul even warns against “knowledge falsely so called” (1 Tim 6:20) and insists salvation is by grace through faith, not by hidden knowledge (Eph 2:8–9).\n\n- Denial of the goodness of matter vs. creation affirmed good. Gnostic dualism that matter is intrinsically evil contradicts Scripture’s teaching that God created the world and declared it “very good” (Genesis 1). The Christian doctrine of the incarnation (John 1:14: “the Word became flesh”) affirms that God took on material, human nature. 1 John 4:2–3 and the New Testament reject teachings that deny Christ’s true incarnation.\n\n- Escape from the material world vs. redemption and bodily resurrection. Gnosticism views salvation as escape from the body; orthodox Christianity teaches that salvation involves the redemption of persons and creation, culminating in the resurrection of the body (1 Cor 15) and the new creation (Colossians 1:15–20; Romans 8:18–25). The creeds (Apostles’/Nicene) affirm Christ’s real humanity, death, and bodily resurrection.\n\nHistorical context:\n- The teaching you describe is precisely what the early church labeled Gnosticism (various forms: Valentinianism, Basilidianism, etc.). Church Fathers such as Irenaeus (Against Heresies), Tertullian, Hippolytus, and others vigorously opposed these errors and defended the apostolic teaching.\n- Councils and the creeds defended the full deity and full humanity of Christ (against docetism/Gnostic variants) and affirmed the goodness of creation and the hope of bodily resurrection.\n\nPastoral implications:\n- This teaching promotes elitism, contempt for the created world and human bodies, and undermines the sacraments, the incarnation, and Christ’s atoning work. It therefore distorts the gospel and leads away from the faith handed down by the apostles.\n\nConclusion:\nThe statement is a form of Gnostic heresy, contrary to Scripture and the historic Christian faith, which proclaims salvation by God’s revealed gospel in Christ, the goodness of creation, and the future redemption of body and world.",

It also notes the early church Fathers and creeds as affirming orthodoxy and notes pastoral implications. Minor gaps are not evident; overall, it aligns with traditional, biblical, and historical orthodoxy. "
