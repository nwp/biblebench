    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus only seemed to have a physical body. He was actually a purely spiritual being who appeared human but wasn't truly human.' Evaluate this teaching.",
    "expected": "This is the heresy of Docetism. It denies the true humanity of Christ. Orthodox Christianity teaches the hypostatic union - Jesus is fully God AND fully human. He had a real physical body, experienced hunger, thirst, fatigue, and truly died on the cross. 1 John 4:2-3 explicitly condemns denying that Jesus came in the flesh, and Hebrews 2:17 states he had to be made fully human to be our high priest.",
    "output": "This teaching is **heresy**, specifically a form of **Docetism**. It directly contradicts the orthodox Christian doctrine of the Incarnation as defined by the early Church Councils and affirmed by Scripture.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this is heretical:\n\n1.  **Denial of the Incarnation:** The core of orthodox Christian faith is that Jesus Christ is **truly God and truly man** in one person (the Hypostatic Union). John 1:14 explicitly states: \"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.\" The Greek word for \"became\" (σεσκηνωσεν - *skenōsen*) implies a real taking on of flesh, not an illusion. This teacher's statement denies the Word's *actual* incarnation, reducing it to a deceptive appearance.\n\n2.  **Denial of Jesus' True Humanity:** The Bible consistently presents Jesus as having a genuine human body, soul, and human experiences:\n    *   He was born of a human mother (Luke 2:10-11).\n    *   He grew physically (Luke 2:40, 52).\n    *   He experienced human needs like hunger (Matthew 4:2), thirst (John 19:28), fatigue (John 4:6), and death (Luke 23:46, John 19:30).\n    *   He was touched (Matthew 9:29, John 20:27), ate food (Luke 24:39-43), and was seen and heard by many (1 John 1:1-3).\n    *   His physical resurrection is central: He showed his physical body to disciples (Luke 24:39: \"Look at my hands and my feet! It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\"), ate with them, and ascended physically into heaven (Acts 1:9-11). Denying his true humanity undermines the reality of the resurrection.\n\n3.  **Undermines Salvation:** The entire Christian understanding of salvation hinges on Jesus being both fully God *and* fully man:\n    *   **As God:** He has the divine authority and power to save, to forgive sins, and to offer a sacrifice of infinite value.\n    *   **As Man:** He represents humanity, standing in our place. He experienced human temptation and suffering (Hebrews 4:15), offering a perfect human obedience. He offered a genuine human sacrifice on the cross, dealing with sin and death *as a real human being*. If he wasn't truly human, he couldn't represent humanity, his sacrifice wouldn't be a genuine human offering, and he couldn't be a faithful high priest interceding for us.\n\n4.  **Contradicts Early Church Councils:**\n    *   **Council of Nicaea (325 AD):** Affirmed Christ's full divinity, establishing that the Son is \"of the same substance\" (*homoousios*) as the Father.\n    *   **Council of Chalcedon (451 AD):** Defined the orthodox understanding of the Incarnation: \"one person in two natures,\" truly God and truly man, without confusion, change, division, or separation. Docetism explicitly violates this by denying the true humanity of Christ.\n\n5.  **Theological Implications of Docetism:**\n    *   **Denies the Goodness of Creation:** It implies that physical matter (including our own bodies) is inherently inferior or evil, a view more aligned with Greek philosophy (Platonism/Gnosticism) than biblical Christianity, which affirms the goodness of God's creation (Genesis 1:31).\n    *   **Denies the Reality of Christ's Work:** If Christ wasn't truly human, his suffering, death, and resurrection are illusions. His teachings and miracles lose their grounding in real human history and experience.\n    *   **Makes Salvation Superficial:** If Christ didn't truly overcome sin, suffering, and death *as a human being*, his victory is merely symbolic, not an actual conquest on behalf of humanity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe teacher's statement that Jesus only *seemed* to have a physical body and was actually a purely spiritual being is **heresy**. It denies the fundamental Christian doctrine of the Incarnation – that the eternal Son of God took on a real, complete human nature, body, and soul, without ceasing to be God. This denial undermines the very basis of Christian salvation, which depends on Christ being both the divine Savior and the representative human sacrifice. Scripture, the early Church Fathers, and the Ecumenical Councils all decisively reject this view (Docetism) as incompatible with the revelation of God in Jesus Christ.",

This is a small philological nuance, not a doctrinal error, but it could mislead about the exact Greek terms in the verse."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies Docetism as the heresy, affirms the biblical teaching of the Incarnation and the hypostatic union, and supplies strong scriptural and historical (Nicene/Chalcedonian) grounding. It emphasizes the human reality of Jesus and the salvific significance of his humanity, which aligns with orthodox teaching. It could be slightly strengthened by explicitly citing 1 John 4:2-3 (which explicitly condemns denying Jesus came in the flesh) and by ensuring precise Greek terminology in John 1:14 (egeneto vs. eskēnōsen). Overall, it is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced in its treatment of the topic."
