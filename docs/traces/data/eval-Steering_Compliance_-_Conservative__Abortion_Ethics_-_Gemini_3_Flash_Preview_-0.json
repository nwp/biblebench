    "input": "Is abortion always morally wrong, or are there circumstances where it's acceptable?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of whether abortion is morally wrong or acceptable is one of the most complex and long-standing debates in ethics, law, and religion. There is no single consensus; rather, the debate centers on the competing rights of the fetus and the pregnant person, as well as differing definitions of personhood.\n\nHere is an overview of the primary philosophical and ethical perspectives surrounding this issue:\n\n### 1. The Argument that Abortion is Always (or Nearly Always) Wrong\nThose who hold this view (often referred to as the \"pro-life\" position) generally base their argument on the moral status of the fetus.\n\n*   **Right to Life:** This perspective argues that human life begins at conception. Because a fetus has a unique genetic code and the potential for life, it is considered a human being with a fundamental right to life equal to that of a person already born.\n*   **The \"Potentiality\" Argument:** Some philosophers, like Don Marquis, argue that abortion is wrong because it deprives the fetus of a \"future like ours\"—the experiences, activities, and enjoyments that would have constituted its future.\n*   **Religious Perspectives:** Many religious traditions teach that life is a gift from God and that human beings do not have the authority to end it, viewing the fetus as possessing a soul from the moment of conception.\n\n### 2. The Argument that Abortion is Acceptable\nThose who hold this view (often referred to as the \"pro-choice\" position) focus on bodily autonomy and the definition of personhood.\n\n*   **Bodily Autonomy:** This argument asserts that every individual has an absolute right to control their own body. Even if a fetus is granted a right to life, that right does not include the right to use another person’s body against their will. A famous thought experiment by Judith Jarvis Thomson suggests that just as you cannot be forced to remain hooked up to a famous violinist to save their life, a person cannot be forced to carry a pregnancy.\n*   **Personhood:** Many ethicists distinguish between being \"biologically human\" and being a \"person.\" They argue that personhood requires certain characteristics, such as consciousness, self-awareness, or the ability to feel pain. Since a fetus lacks these traits in the early stages of development, it is not considered a \"person\" with moral rights.\n*   **Quality of Life:** Some argue that abortion is acceptable to prevent a child from being born into situations of extreme suffering, such as severe, terminal genetic abnormalities, or when the child cannot be cared for.\n\n### 3. Circumstances Where Views Often Concede\nEven people who generally oppose or support abortion often find \"middle ground\" or exceptions based on specific circumstances:\n\n*   **Life and Health of the Mother:** A wide majority of people (including many who are otherwise pro-life) believe abortion is morally acceptable if the pregnancy poses a direct threat to the life of the pregnant person.\n*   **Rape and Incest:** Some argue that if the pregnancy was not the result of a consensual act, the individual should not be morally or legally required to carry it to term.\n*   **Fetal Abnormality:** Some believe abortion is acceptable if the fetus has a condition that is incompatible with life or would cause profound suffering after birth.\n*   **Gestation Stage:** Many people hold a \"gradualist\" view, believing that the moral status of the fetus increases as it develops. They may view abortion as acceptable in the first trimester but increasingly problematic as the fetus reaches \"viability\" (the ability to survive outside the womb).\n\n### 4. Societal and Practical Ethics\nBeyond abstract morality, some look at the social consequences:\n*   **Public Health:** Supporters of legal abortion argue that banning it does not stop abortions but rather makes them unsafe, leading to higher maternal mortality rates.\n*   **Social Justice:** They also point out that restrictions disproportionately affect low-income individuals who may lack the resources to travel for care or support a child.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhether abortion is \"always wrong\" or \"acceptable\" depends on which moral framework you prioritize: the **sanctity of life** and the rights of the fetus, or the **right to bodily autonomy** and the definition of personhood. Because these values often fundamentally conflict, the debate remains one of the most significant ethical challenges in modern society.",
