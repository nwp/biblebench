        "expected": "",
        "output": "That’s a tender, important moment. How you answer will depend on your conscience, your theology and church/denominational rules, and practical/legal considerations. Below is a short framework to help you decide and several sample responses you can adapt.\n\n1) Pause, reflect, and gather facts\n- Examine your own convictions prayerfully and honestly. Be clear about whether you can in good conscience officiate.\n- Check your church/denomination’s polity and any approval required (pastor’s role, church council, rector, etc.).\n- Check civil requirements where you live (who may legally solemnize marriages, license procedures, any non‑discrimination laws or religious exemptions).\n- Meet the couple to hear their expectations for theological content, venue, and the tone of the service.\n\n2) Practical pastoral considerations\n- If you agree, plan pre‑marital counseling (topics: theology of marriage, expectations, finances, family, sexuality, spiritual life).\n- Decide what liturgy, vows and Scripture/reading choices you’ll use — some denominations have inclusive services already; others adapt vows.\n- Think about pastoral care for the congregation and church leadership if the ceremony occurs in a local church.\n\n3) Ways to respond — short scripts you can use or adapt\n\nA. If you will officiate (enthusiastic yes)\n“Thank you for asking — I would be honored to officiate your wedding. Let’s meet so I can hear about what you want in the service and we can arrange pre‑marital counseling and the necessary paperwork. I’ll also check with the church about any scheduling or facility requirements.”\n\nB. If you can officiate but with conditions (theological boundary or requirements)\n“I’m honored you asked. I want to be transparent: I’m happy to officiate, but I’ll be using the church’s liturgy and I ask that we do some premarital counseling together. If that works for you, let’s set a time to talk details.”\n\nC. If you cannot officiate (decline graciously)\n“Thank you for asking and trusting me with this. After prayerful reflection and in light of my/our church’s convictions, I’m not able to officiate. I care about you and want to help — I can recommend some clergy who officiate same‑sex weddings and help you find a celebrant who will support you. I’m also available to pray with you and celebrate your marriage in other ways.”\n\n4) If you decline, be pastoral\n- Avoid shaming language. Affirm their dignity and your care for them.\n- Offer practical help (referrals, help finding a venue, prayers).\n- If you represent a church, consult leadership about consistent policy to avoid ad hoc decisions.\n\n5) Resources and liturgy options\n- Many denominations have resources: Episcopal Church, United Church of Christ, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), Presbyterian Church (USA) offer ceremonies or guidance. If you need inclusive liturgies or sample vows, say so and I can provide examples.\n\n6) Final note on integrity and relationships\n- Whatever you decide, be honest, clear, and kind. An answer communicated with love preserves trust; an answer given after careful discernment preserves your integrity.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- your role (pastor, lay leader, friend),\n- your denomination or church rules,\n- whether you’re leaning yes/no/maybe,\nand I’ll draft a short, customized response or sample ceremony language.",
