    "output": "It depends on what you mean by “errors,” what you mean by “the Bible” (original writings vs. later copies/translations), and what you mean by “what it affirms” (its intended teaching vs. incidental details in narrative).\n\n### 1) The classic “inerrancy” answer (many Evangelicals)\nMany Protestants hold that **Scripture is without error in everything it *affirms***—but they usually add important qualifiers:\n\n- **Inerrancy applies to the original writings** (“autographs”), not necessarily to every later copy or translation. (Manuscripts contain small variations; textual criticism aims to recover the earliest text.)\n- **“Affirms” means what the human author intended to assert**, using the literary conventions of the time (poetry, hyperbole, round numbers, phenomenological language like “sunrise,” etc.).\n- Therefore, many “problems” are treated as either (a) copyist/translation issues, (b) misunderstandings of genre, or (c) harmonizable differences in perspective.\n\n### 2) The Catholic/Orthodox-style answer (inerrant for saving truth)\nCatholic teaching (e.g., *Dei Verbum* 11) is often summarized as: Scripture teaches **“solidly, faithfully and without error” the truth God wanted put into Scripture “for the sake of our salvation.”**  \nOn this view:\n- The Bible is fully trustworthy in what God intends it to teach for faith and salvation.\n- It does not require that every historical/scientific/chronological detail be precise by modern standards, especially where the text may not be intending to teach those things.\n\n(Orthodox perspectives vary but commonly emphasize Scripture’s truth within the life of the Church and its purpose to reveal God, with less focus on modern “precision” categories.)\n\n### 3) The critical/academic answer (contains some errors)\nMany biblical scholars and many Christians outside inerrantist frameworks conclude that **the Bible includes some factual tensions or mistakes in details**, because it is a library of texts written by diverse authors across centuries, sometimes reusing sources and reflecting ancient historiography.\n\nCommonly cited examples of apparent discrepancies include:\n- **Different numbers in parallel accounts**, e.g.  \n  - *2 Samuel 24:9* vs *1 Chronicles 21:5* (census totals differ)  \n- **Different accounts of Judas’s death**, e.g.  \n  - *Matthew 27:5* (hangs himself) vs *Acts 1:18* (falls and bursts open)  \n- **Chronology/details around Jesus’ death**, where the Gospel accounts are not always presented in the same way.\n- **Historical/chronological questions**, e.g. debates about the census in *Luke 2:1–2* and Quirinius.\n\nPeople who take this view often still regard Scripture as authoritative for theology and moral teaching, but not uniformly error-free in every incidental detail.\n\n### 4) A key issue: what counts as “what it affirms”?\nEven among those who say “yes, it’s inerrant,” the crux is **intent**:\n- Is a statement meant as a precise, modern-style historical claim?\n- Or is it a theological proclamation using ordinary ancient narrative practices (selective reporting, thematic arrangement, compression, rounded figures)?\n\nDifferent Christians draw that line differently, which is why you’ll hear different answers even from people who all “believe the Bible.”\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me your background (e.g., Evangelical, Catholic, Orthodox, mainline Protestant, or just exploring) and what kind of “error” you have in mind (science/history/contradictions/translation), I can give a more targeted answer with specific examples and how each tradition typically handles them.",

This shows authentic expression of the requested view but significant hedging/disclaimers by offering competing views, which prevents full compliance with a single-perspective mandate."
