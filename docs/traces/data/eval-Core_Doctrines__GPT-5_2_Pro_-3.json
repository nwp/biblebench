    "input": "What is the doctrine of original sin?",
    "expected": "Original sin is the doctrine that all humanity inherited a sinful nature from Adam's fall. As a result, all people are born with a inclination toward sin and are spiritually separated from God. This doesn't mean infants are guilty of actual sins, but that human nature is corrupted and inclined toward evil apart from God's grace.",
    "output": "## Definition\n\n**Original sin** is the Christian doctrine that humanity, through Adam’s first disobedience, now exists in a **fallen condition** that is **universal** and **inherited**, so that all people are born:\n\n1. **With a corrupted nature** (a bent or inclination toward sin, not moral neutrality), and  \n2. **Under sin’s reign and its consequences**, especially **death**—and, in much Western theology, also **liable to guilt** because Adam acted as humanity’s representative head.\n\nOriginal sin is therefore not first of all “the first sin,” but **the enduring state and damage** that resulted from it, which then gives rise to our **actual sins**.\n\n---\n\n## Biblical grounding\n\n### 1) The fall and its consequences (Genesis 3)\nGenesis portrays the entrance of sin through Adam and Eve’s rebellion, bringing alienation from God, disordered desires, curse, and death (Gen 3). The rest of Scripture treats this as a decisive turning point for the human race.\n\n### 2) Adam as representative head; sin and death spread to all (Romans 5:12–21)\nPaul connects Adam’s trespass to the condition of all:\n\n- “**Sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned**” (Rom 5:12).\n- “**By the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners**” (Rom 5:19).\n- Adam’s act has corporate effects, just as Christ’s obedience has corporate saving effects (Rom 5:15–19). This “Adam/Christ” parallel is central: **Christ is the “last Adam”** who reverses what Adam brought (cf. 1 Cor 15:21–22, 45).\n\n### 3) Sinfulness from the start of life (Psalm 51:5)\nDavid laments: “**In sin did my mother conceive me**” (Ps 51:5). The point is not that conception is sinful, but that sin reaches back to the beginning of personal existence—supporting the idea of an inherited condition.\n\n### 4) Humans by nature under sin’s power (Ephesians 2:1–3)\nPaul describes people as “**dead in…trespasses and sins**” and “**by nature children of wrath**” (Eph 2:1–3), indicating an ingrained condition preceding deliberate reform.\n\n### 5) Universal sinfulness (Romans 3:9–23)\n“All…are under sin…**none is righteous**” (Rom 3:9–12) and “**all have sinned**” (Rom 3:23). Original sin explains why this universality is not merely the result of imitation, but of a shared fallen nature.\n\n---\n\n## What the doctrine includes (classic Western articulation)\n\n1. **Loss of original righteousness**: Humanity was made good and upright, but the fall brought a real moral-spiritual ruin (Gen 1:26–31; Eccl 7:29).\n2. **Inherited corruption (“sin nature”)**: We are born with disordered loves and desires; sin is not only chosen but also *dwells in us* (cf. Rom 7:17–20).\n3. **Reign of death**: Death is not merely natural; it is tied to sin’s entrance and dominion (Rom 5:12–14; 1 Cor 15:21–22).\n4. **(In much Western theology) Imputed guilt / federal headship**: Because Adam stands as covenant representative of humanity, his trespass has judicial consequences for those “in Adam” (Rom 5:16–19). This is paired with the good news that believers are counted righteous “in Christ.”\n\n---\n\n## Major Christian nuances\n\n- **Roman Catholic theology** typically speaks of original sin as the **privation of original holiness and justice**, transmitted to all; it emphasizes inherited deprivation and concupiscence, with baptism as God’s remedy for original sin.\n- **Reformation Protestant theology** (Lutheran/Reformed) strongly emphasizes both **inherited corruption** and **imputed guilt**, grounded in Adam’s headship in Romans 5.\n- **Eastern Orthodox theology** often prefers the term **“ancestral sin”**, emphasizing inheritance of **corruption and mortality** more than inherited guilt, while still affirming that all humans are born into a fallen condition needing salvation.\n\nDespite differences, all agree the fall has **real, universal, inherited consequences** and that salvation is **by God’s grace in Christ**, not by unaided human moral effort.\n\n---\n\n## Why it matters\n\nOriginal sin explains why:\n- sin is **universal and pervasive** (not merely bad habits),\n- humans need **new birth** and **grace**, not self-improvement alone (John 3:3–6; Eph 2:4–9),\n- Christ’s saving work is not only forgiveness of individual acts but the **deliverance of a fallen race**—moving us from being “in Adam” to being “in Christ” (Rom 5; 1 Cor 15).\n\nIf you want, I can summarize how Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, and the Orthodox fathers each frame the doctrine, or walk through Romans 5:12–21 verse by verse.",

          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM response provides a solid, well-rounded account of original sin as a universal, inherited condition that corrupts human nature and entails death, with an appropriate emphasis on both the intra-biblical data (Gen 3; Rom 5; Eph 2; Rom 3; 1 Cor 15) and the typical Western/orthodox distinctions (original sin vs. actual sin; corrupt nature vs. personal guilt). It correctly highlights Adam’s representative headship and the Christological analogy (Adam/Christ) and notes major doctrinal nuances across Catholic, Protestant, and Eastern Orthodox traditions. It also adequately explains why original sin matters for salvation (need for grace and new birth). The main caveats are minor interpretive tensions: (1) imputed guilt is not uniformly emphasized across Western traditions (Catholic theology often describes original sin as deprivation and concupiscence rather than a blanket imputed guilt), and (2) Psalm 51:5 is a debated text for proving inherited sin. Despite these caveats, the overall depiction is doctrinally accurate, biblically grounded, and nuanced."

          "explanation": "The response presents a broadly orthodox summary of original sin, affirming universal sinfulness, inherited corruption, and the necessity of grace. It cites standard texts (Genesis 3; Romans 5; Romans 3; 1 Corinthians 15; Ephesians 2; Psalm 51) and articulates the traditional Adam–Christ contrast (federal headship and the “in Adam / in Christ” motif). It also accurately notes major historical traditions: Catholic (privation of original holiness), Protestant (inherited corruption and imputed guilt), and Orthodox (ancestral sin emphasizing corruption and mortality). There are no explicit heretical claims (e.g., denial of Christ’s divinity, heretical Modalism, Gnosticism, Pelagianism, etc.). The main points are in line with historic Christian orthodoxy, with appropriate caveats about differing emphases among traditions. Minor interpretive nuances are acknowledged (e.g., how Romans 5:12–19 or Psalm 51:5 are understood across traditions), but these do not constitute teaching heresy. If desired, the response could further clarify ongoing scholarly debates about guilt imputation vs. inherited corruption, but that would be nuance rather than error."
