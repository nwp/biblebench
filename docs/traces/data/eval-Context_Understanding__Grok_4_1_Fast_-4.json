And he opened his mouth and *taught them*.\" (ESV; emphasis added)\n  - Jesus ascends a mountainside (evoking Moses on Sinai), assumes the seated posture of a rabbi teaching, and specifically directs his words to the disciples who approach him. The Greek *autos* (\"them\") in v. 2 refers back to the disciples.\n- **Matthew 7:28**: \"And when Jesus finished these sayings, *the crowds were astonished* at his teaching.\"\n  - This confirms the crowds were present and listening but positioned as observers, not direct addressees.\n\n### Context\n- **Setting**: Early in Jesus' Galilean ministry (ca. AD 28–30), following large crowds from Decapolis, Galilee, Judea, and beyond (Matt. 4:25). The sermon outlines kingdom ethics for committed followers.\n- **Disciple-Focused Content**: It begins with the Beatitudes (\"Blessed are... for theirs is the kingdom,\" Matt. 5:3–12), uses discipleship language (e.g., \"you are the salt... light,\" 5:13–16; \"unless your righteousness exceeds...,\" 5:20), and ends with a call to action (\"everyone... who hears these words... acts on them,\" 7:24).\n- **Parallel in Luke**: The Sermon on the Plain (Luke 6:17–49) similarly addresses disciples amid a crowd (Luke 6:20: \"he lifted up his eyes on *his disciples*\"), supporting the disciple-centric focus.\n\n### Scholarly Consensus\nThere is broad agreement among scholars (evangelical, critical, and historical-critical) that the disciples are the primary audience, with crowds as secondary hearers. No significant debate exists; traditional views (e.g., patristic authors like Augustine) and modern commentaries (e.g., Davies-Allison, Luz, France) affirm this. Some note redactional shaping by Matthew to emphasize discipleship for a 1st-century Jewish-Christian community.",

            "The statement that there is broad consensus and that 'no significant debate exists' about the Sermon’s primary audience overstates the scholarly position; there is ongoing discussion and nuance about whether the Sermon is addressed chiefly to Jesus' disciples, to the broader crowd, or to a community-shaped audience (as Matthew might imply for a Jewish-Christian readership).",
            "While the LLM cites Luke as supporting a disciple-centric focus, Luke’s parallel (Sermon on the Plain) is not a perfect one-to-one, and some scholars argue for slightly different emphasis in Luke’s context. This nuance could be more carefully framed rather than treated as a straightforward corroboration."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer correctly identifies the Sermon on the Mount as primarily directed to Jesus’ disciples with crowds present as listeners. It provides textual evidence (Matt 5:1–2; 7:28) and contextual notes (Beatitudes, disciple-focused language, Luke’s parallel) and reflects a common scholarly position. However, it overstates consensus by claiming there is no significant debate and implies Luke’s parallel unambiguously reinforces a disciple-centric focus. In reality, scholars recognize a spectrum of views about audience and purpose, and Luke’s Sermon on the Plain offers a related but not identical context. The core factual points are solid, but the nuance could be more carefully qualified."
