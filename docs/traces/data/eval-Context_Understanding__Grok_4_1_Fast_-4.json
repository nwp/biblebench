          "rationale": "The Sermon on the Mount is commonly understood to be delivered to a dual audience: Jesus’ disciples, with the crowds gathered and listening (Matthew 5:1). The LLM’s answer correctly identifies disciples as part of the audience, but it ignores the crowd’s presence and listening role, which is biblically significant. This makes the claim partially inaccurate and lacking in nuance, though not heretical. The doctrine itself (ethical instruction for followers) remains orthodox."
