    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "**Short answer**\n\nA group that uses Christian language and claims to follow Jesus can be considered *outside orthodox Christianity* when it diverges from **core doctrines that have been historically received at the ecumenical councils** (e.g., the doctrine of the Trinity, the nature of Christ, the salvific work of His death and resurrection, the scriptural canon and the need for apostolic authority).  The boundary is not a sharp line but a *gradual slope*—the farther a group departs from the key convictions enshrined in the earliest creeds, the farther it is pushed out of what most scholars and the great Christian traditions call “orthodox.” The precise point at which a group stops being “orthodox” depends on the tradition speaking about it – Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Protestant, or an ecumenical body – but all of them share a similar but not identical set of criteria.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What “orthodox Christianity” normally means\n\n| Tradition | Typical expression of “orthodox” | Core consensus points |\n|-----------|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Roman Catholic** | *Catholic, in the true faith* | 1. Trinitarian doctrine; 2. Christ’s divinity and humanity (in person); 3. Human nature of Christ; 4. Death & resurrection as the fulcrum of salvation; 5. Scripture as revealed and inspired; 6. The need for the Church’s teaching authority (Magisterium) and apostolic succession; 7. Sacramental life (e.g., Eucharist, Baptism). |\n| **Eastern Orthodox** | *Orthodoxy* (keeping what has been received) | 1. Same doctrinal tenets as above but careered through the 7 ecumenical councils (especially the councils on Christology and the Trinity); 2. Apostolic succession through bishops; 3. Liturgical sacramentalism; 4. The same scriptures and a respect for the church’s “unbroken line” of teaching. |\n| **Anglican (Protestant‑Covenantian)** | *Protestant, but that keeps the historic creed* | 1. Trinitarian creed of Nicaea–Constantinople; 2. The value of the Book of Common Prayer as an Anglican confession; 3. Scripture as the sole rule of faith; 4. Sacramental life (Baptism, Eucharist) rather than a purely symbolic affirmation; 5. Recognition of bishops and an episcopal structure. |\n| **Mainline/evangelical Protestant** | *Christianity that keeps the five‑point “core” truths* | 1. Trinitarianism; 2. The divinity of Christ; 3. The Atonement by His death & resurrection; 4. Scripture as the inspired Word of God; 5. The necessity of personal faith; 6. The importance (though not all agree on how) of sacraments. |\n| **Other protestant families** | *Each keeps some subset of the above* | Many use the Nicene Creed and Christ’s name as a start‑point for their confession but may differ on secondary points (e.g., the exact nature of the Holy Spirit, the extent of sacraments, the possibility of post‑mortem life). |\n\nThe **common denominator** is the set of **five “essentials”** found in the first<br>four *Nicene* documents (Nicaea I, Constantinople I & II, Ephesus, Chalcedon):\n\n1. **Trinitarian doctrine**   – God is one in three persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit).  \n2. **Christology** – Jesus of Nazareth is\n   - *God in flesh* (consubstantial with the Father, *consubstantiá*),  \n   - *Both fully human and fully divine* (Christ had a real humanity, not merely a “simulated” one).  \n3. **Atonement** – His death on the cross reconciles humanity to God, and his **resurrection** guarantees victory over sin and death.  \n4. **Scriptural Authority** – the risen God’s Word, in words He gave, is the basis for doctrine.  \n5. **A Church of authority** – a community that preserves the Holy Scriptures in tradition, with an apostolic line.  \n\nIf a group **rejects** even one of the five, it is normally judged by the major Christian traditions as *outside* of orthodox Christianity. If it *rediscovers* wrong beliefs from the periphery—e.g., “only one person of God” (Oneness Pentecostals), “Christ is a perfect man but not divine” (some Mormon groups), “there is no after‑life beyond judgment” (certain sects), then it is distanced from orthodoxy.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How the “line” is drawn historically\n\n| Historical Landmark | Infecting criteria | Impact on non‑orthodox groups |\n|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Council of Nicaea (381 AD)** | The right doctrine of the Trinity, the credit of the *Nicene Creed* | Any group denying the Trinity is deemed heretical here. |\n| **Council of Chalcedon (451 AD)** | Christ is **two natures** (divine & human) in one person; will×will *hypostatic union*. | Groups insisting on “one nature” or “two separate persons” were called heretical. |\n| **Council of Ephesus (431 AD)** | *Theotokos* – a female mother of a divine son (Mary). | Rejecting the title \"Mother of God\" is a deviation from the Creed. |\n| **Council of Constantinople I (381 AD)** | The Holy Spirit as *full God*. | Rejecting a Spirit that is *substantial* is a departure. |\n| **Council of Trente (1545‑1563)** (Catholic Reformation) | Reaffirmed the *centrality of the Church* and the *magisterial authority*. | Protestants and sects that deny Church authority were considered “outside” Catholic orthodoxy. |\n\n**Ecumenical dialogue** uses the same five points, though each tradition weighs them slightly differently. For example:\n\n* **The Catholic Church** invites groups that hold the Nicene Creed *likewise* but who have lost the continuity of apostolic succession or have lost the Magisterium to be “out of communion.”  \n* **The Eastern Orthodox** likewise says a group can call itself Christian *if* it holds the same Creed but *rejects* the need for bishop oversight or the \"sacral state\" of the Church; it would therefore be seen as “outside” the Orthodox communion.  \n* **Protestant churches** tend to be more readiness to call groups *orthodox* merely on doctrinal grounds. They can, however, still *denounce* a group for diverging from the “five core truths.”  \n\n---\n\n## 3.  Concrete Criteria Used by Major Christian Bodies\n\n1. **Rejection or alteration of the *Nicene Creed*  \n   - *Trinitarian* (Reject? – Outside).  \n   - *Christology* (Reject? – Outside).  \n   - *Atonement/Resurrection* (Reject? – Outside).  \n\n2. **Scriptural canon**  \n   - A group that uses a canon very different from the one adopted by the early Christian church; including or excluding entire sections that were historically accepted (e.g., the *deuterocanonical books*).  \n   - Some sects reject the New Testament entirely or reinterpret it radically (e.g., some *Islamic Christian* sects).  \n\n3. **Ecclesiology / Church structure**  \n   - **Apostolic succession**: Catholics and Orthodox states lack this.  \n   - **Hierarchical oversight**: People who claim to be “universal Christians” without a recognized authority fall outside (e.g., Jesus‑movements or idiosyncratic “followers” who choose to act alone).  \n\n4. **Sacramental theology**  \n   - *Baptism & Eucharist:* Rejecting them as *necessary and real* or only symbolic – many churches would say this is a point beyond “orthodox.”  \n   - A cult that interferes with the meaning of these sacraments or uses them for diabolical ends will be labeled *outside*.  \n\n5. **Doctrinal content & moral teachings**  \n   - Doctrines about the *nature of salvation* and *after‑life*, e.g., stating that salvation is by works alone or that Jesus is not a Savior, bring a group outside mainstream theology.  \n\nThese criteria form a *framework* for most official statements. For instance, the _Catholic_ dogma **_Dei Verbum_** (1975) identifies the principles for Scripture, authority, creed, and sacraments; the Catholic Church uses these to decide if another community is truly 'Christian' but out of communion.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Practical Examples\n\n| Group | How it differs | Why most church bodies think it is *outside* orthodoxy |\n|-------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Jehovah’s Witnesses** | Reject the Trinity; consider humans (the Holy Spirit) as created, not God. | Dualistic view of God – not in line with the Nicene Creed. |\n| **Mormonism (LDS)** | Consider humans can become gods; Adam/Moses as “world controllers.” | Both Christology and soterology depart radically. |\n| **Oneness Pentecostalism** | “Jesus alone”; no distinct persons in God. | Non‑Trinitarian. |\n| **Some *Christian Science* / *New Age* groups** | Accept Christ but deny bodily death, see death as a false reality. | Dismisses dead, bodily resurrection and atonement. |\n| **Various *Recovering* or *Irish* sects** | Smuggle in *apostolic* or *secular* reinterpretations of Scripture (e.g., a *Deistic* view). | They are self‑claimed Christian but have no catholic doctrine. |\n\nIn every case, the line was drawn by the mainstream churches when the group *verified* a systematic denial of at least one of the five \"core truths\".  \nIn some cases, *small* departures lead to *internal debates*; for example, **Arminianism vs. Calvinism** (predestination), which many conservatives see as *outside* but many mainline churches consider *orthodox*—because they do not disturb the essential ontological, theological convictions required.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  The “Gray Zone”: Where the boundary is fuzzy\n\n1. **Denominational spill‑over**  \n   *E.g.** “Protestant churches that consider themselves “faith‑based” and embrace a *Noble Creed* that maybe adds \"He is the way, the truth, and the life\" but remains Trinitarian.*  \n   Many would still count them *orthodox*; the problem arises when they ask to ignore certain sacrament teachings or leave the hierarchical structures.\n\n2. **Schismatic groups**  \n   For instance, the *Free Catholics* or *Independent Catholic Churches* claim apostolic authority but have diverging doctrines.  \n   Whether they are wholly “outside” depends on whether their doctrine diverges from the historical narrative at the councils or merely their *practice* differs.\n\n3. **Multi‑Faith or “Christ‑centric” religions**  \n   Some novel spiritualities use Christian imagery and the name of Jesus but have no doctrinal commitment to the historic church’s core.  \n   Though they identify as Christian, mainstream churches strongly discourage equating them with orthodoxy.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Why this matters\n\n* **Ecumenical Dialogue** – In talks between Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican and Protestant bodies, the church must determine whether a group is a *Member of the Faith* or a *Sect in opposition* to avoid compromising doctrine.  \n* **Legal and Social Context** – The Church may treat outside groups differently in matters of membership of societies or charitable legitimacy.  \n* **Spiritual Witness** – For believers who want to decide whether to accept teachings or join a community, the criteria show how far the community’s teaching lines up with the first 1500 years of Christian self‑definition.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA group that uses Christian language and claims to follow Jesus is usually *outside orthodox Christianity* when it **rejects, substantially alters, or refrains from accepting** **any** of the five key doctrines recognized in the early ecumenical councils. Where the denominational tradition places a little more or less emphasis on the *sacramental,* *magisterial,* or *canonical* aspects determines the precise *line.* The vagueness arises because, over centuries, interpretations have shifted, new theological developments have arisen, and some groups see themselves as “plain Christian” even when major traditions have considered them heretical.\n\nThe defining tutorial for most scholars is the use or misuse of the **Trinitarian Creed, Christology, Atonement, Scripture, and the Church’s authority**. Deviate from one, and the group is generally considered *outside* the majority of Christian orthodoxy. The nearer the group turns back toward these core truths, the more likely the mainstream churches will see it as part of the wider, though sometimes distinct, Christian community.",

However, it contains a factual error about apostolic succession (Catholic and Orthodox claim it; they do not lack it). It also tends to equate 'church authority' with apostolic succession, which marginalizes many Protestant bodies that are broadly accepted as orthodox in historic Christianity while rejecting episcopal succession. The piece would also benefit from explicit biblical grounding (scripture citations) for the five essentials and more precise treatment of how different traditions define orthodoxy. The nuance is present, but the doctrinal/scriptural basis and some claims about boundaries are not fully accurate."
