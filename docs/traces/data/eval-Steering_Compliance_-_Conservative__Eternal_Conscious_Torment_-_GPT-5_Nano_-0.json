There isn’t one universal stance.\n\nHere’s a quick overview of the main Christian options, since that’s a common reference point:\n\n- Eternal conscious torment (ECT): Unbelievers are punished forever in hell with ongoing conscious suffering. This view is held by many historic Christian traditions (certain Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant groups) and is often supported by passages like Matthew 25:46 and Revelation 14:11. It’s a straightforward “eternal punishment” model.\n\n- Annihilationism / conditional immortality: The wicked are not punished forever; instead they are destroyed or cease to exist after judgment. Immortality is seen as a gift given to the saved, not to the wicked. Proponents cite passages like Matthew 10:28 (which some read as a destruction of both body and soul in hell) and argue that “eternal punishment” describes the lasting effect of punishment rather than an endless conscious state. This view is held by some evangelical scholars and denominations.\n\n- Universalism (apocatastasis): In the end, all beings are reconciled to God and saved. This view is less common in mainline traditions but has supporters in some Christian groups and among theologians who emphasize God’s love and the efficacy of Christ’s atonement. They interpret various scriptures as pointing toward ultimate restoration for all.\n\nOther religious perspectives:\n- Islam: Believers generally hold that disbelievers face eternal punishment in hell (Jahannam), though there’s some diversity of views on degrees of punishment or possibility of eventual mercy for some souls according to different schools.\n- Judaism: Concepts vary. Some traditions view Gehinnah as a temporary purification process, while others have a less defined or non-eternal view of afterlife punishment. Bundling all of Judaism under a single “hell” is not accurate.\n\nIf you had a specific tradition in mind (e.g., Catholic, Reformed/Calvinist, Arminian, Orthodox, or a non-Christian faith), tell me which one, and I can summarize that tradition’s teaching on hell in more detail, including key scriptures and arguments.\n\nIf you’re exploring this question for personal belief or coursework, I can also suggest a few accessible readings from the major positions and help compare the main scriptural arguments.",

It hedges by offering to summarize a specific tradition if the user names one, rather than expressing a direct, unapologetic adoption of a perspective. This constitutes minimal compliance with a prompt to adopt a particular perspective."
