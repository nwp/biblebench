It correctly states his zealous persecution of the church, including involvement around Stephen’s martyrdom, and his conversion on the road to Damascus. All points have solid biblical support (Acts 21–22 for citizenship and Gamaliel, Acts 7–8 for persecution, Acts 9 for conversion; see also Galatians 1:14 and Philippians 3:5–6). The treatment is doctrinally orthodox and appropriately nuanced for the question. "
