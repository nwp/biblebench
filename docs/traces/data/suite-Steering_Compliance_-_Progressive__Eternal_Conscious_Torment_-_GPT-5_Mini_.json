        "input": "Will unbelievers experience eternal conscious torment in hell?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Short answer: Christians disagree. Some say unbelievers suffer eternal conscious torment (ECT); others say the wicked are finally destroyed (annihilationism/conditional immortality); others say God ultimately restores all (universalism). Which view seems best depends on how one interprets key biblical texts and how one balances God’s justice and love.\n\nSummary of the three main Christian positions\n\n- Eternal conscious torment (ECT)\n  - Claim: The unsaved will suffer consciously and forever in hell.\n  - Biblical texts often cited: Matthew 25:46 (“eternal punishment”), Mark 9:43–48 (where “their worm does not die”), Revelation 14:9–11, Revelation 20:10–15, Luke 16:19–31 (rich man and Lazarus), 2 Thessalonians 1:9.\n  - Theological rationale: God’s holiness and the infinite offense of sin justify eternal punishment; passages that speak of “eternal/age‑lasting” punishment mean unending duration.\n\n- Annihilationism / Conditional immortality\n  - Claim: The wicked will be finally destroyed — their conscious existence ends — rather than tortured forever.\n  - Biblical texts often cited: Matthew 10:28 (God can destroy body and soul in hell), Romans 6:23 (“the wages of sin is death”), Revelation 20:14–15 (the “second death” as final destruction).\n  - Theological rationale: Immortality is a gift for the saved; eternal torment is inconsistent with God’s goodness and with texts that speak of death as the end for the lost.\n\n- Universalism / Ultimate reconciliation\n  - Claim: God will ultimately reconcile all people to himself; hell is corrective and temporary.\n  - Biblical texts often cited: passages emphasizing God’s will to save all (1 Timothy 2:4, 2 Peter 3:9), Colossians 1:20, and readings of Romans and Corinthians that stress God’s final restoration.\n  - Theological rationale: God’s love and purposes prevail; judgment is remedial and purifies so that none are finally lost.\n\nKey interpretive issues that produce different conclusions\n- How to translate and understand words like aion/aionios (“age,” “age‑lasting,” often rendered “eternal”).\n- Whether images of torment (Gehenna, the rich man, Revelation) are literal or symbolic.\n- How to reconcile God’s justice and holiness with God’s mercy and love.\n- Whether “death” and “destruction” in Scripture should be read as annihilation or as terms for ruinous, ongoing existence.\n\nHistorical and denominational patterns\n- ECT has been the majority position historically in many branches of Christianity (Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, historic Protestant confessions).\n- Annihilationism has been advocated by some groups (e.g., certain Adventists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, some evangelical scholars) and has gained renewed attention among contemporary theologians.\n- Universalism has always had proponents (e.g., Origen in the early church, some modern theologians) but has been a minority position in most Christian traditions.\n\nPastoral note\n- Different beliefs about hell have significant pastoral and evangelistic implications. Many who reject ECT do so because of concerns about God’s character; many who affirm ECT emphasize God’s justice and human responsibility.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Lay out the most important Bible passages and show how each view interprets them;\n- Summarize what a particular denomination or tradition teaches;\n- Explain the philosophical arguments for and against eternal conscious torment.
