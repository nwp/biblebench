    "expected": "This resembles Marcionism, a second-century heresy that rejected the Old Testament and taught there were two different gods. This is false. Orthodox Christianity affirms the unity of God across both Testaments. The same God who created the world, gave the law, and showed justice in the Old Testament is the God who sent Jesus. Jesus himself affirmed the Old Testament (Matthew 5:17-18) and revealed God's character as both just and merciful throughout scripture.",
    "output": "### Short Answer  \nThe teaching that “the God of the Old Testament is a different, wrathful‑and‑evil being and that only in Jesus do we encounter the true, good God” is **not orthodox**. It is a classic form of **dualistic heresy** (most closely related to **Marcionism**) because it denies the biblical doctrine of the **unity of God**, the **immutability** (unchangeableness) of God’s nature, and the continuity of God’s self‑revelation from the Old Testament (OT) to the New Testament (NT).  \n\n---\n\n## 1. What Orthodoxy Holds About God’s Identity\n\n| Doctrine | Biblical Witness | Creedal/Confessional Formulation |\n|----------|------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **One God revealed in both Testaments** | Deut. 6:4 “Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is one”; John 1:1‑3; Acts 2:36; Heb 1:8‑10. | *Nicene Creed*: “We believe in one God, the Father Almighty… and in one Lord Jesus Christ… of one substance with the Father.” |\n| **God is immutable (unchanging in nature and character)** | Mal. 3:6 “For I the LORD am unchanging”; James 1:17 “the Father of lights… does not change.” | *Apostles’ Creed*: “I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.” (No “change of character” in the Creator.) |\n| **God’s attributes are consistent** (love, holiness, justice, mercy, righteousness, wisdom) | Throughout Scripture: love (Deut. 7:9, John 3:16), holiness (Lev. 11:44‑45, 1 Pet. 1:16), justice (Ps 89:14, Rom 2:5‑8), mercy (Ex 34:6‑7, Eph 2:4‑5). | *Catechism of the Catholic Church* §206: “God is immutable; He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.” |\n| **God’s revelation is progressive, not contradictory** | “Progressive revelation” – the covenant, the law, the prophetic promises, and finally the incarnation (cf. Heb 1 & 2). | *Council of Nicaea* (325) condemned “those who say that the Son is a created being and therefore not fully God.” (implied continuity.) |\n\n### Key Biblical Themes that Show Unity\n\n1. **Covenantal Faithfulness** – The same God who brought Abraham out of Ur (Gen 12) also sent Jesus (Matt 1:1).  \n2. **The Prophetic Anticipation of the Messiah** – Isaiah 9:6, 53 speak of a “God with us”; Jesus fulfills those promises (Matt 26:54).  \n3. **Jesus’ Own Testimony** – John 5:18, 8:58, 10:30: “I and the Father are one.” He does **not** present a different deity; He claims to reveal the same Father.  \n4. **The Book of Hebrews** – Declares that the “same Lord is the author of both covenants” (Heb 8:6‑13).  \n5. **Peter’s Confirmation** – “The same Lord is in heaven” (2 Pet 3:5) and “the same Jesus Christ” (1 Pet 1:20) are the object of salvation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the Statement Is Theologically Faulty\n\n### 2.1. It Creates Two Gods → **Dualism (Marcionism)**\n\n- **Marcion of Sinope (2nd c.)** taught that the “god of the law” was a lesser, wrathful demiurge, while the “god of love” revealed in Christ was a completely new deity.  \n- The early church condemned this in **Canon 4 of the Synod of Rome (c. 144 AD)** and the **Apostolic Constitutions (8th c.)**: *“There is only one God, creator of all; the God of the Old Testament is the same God whom we confess in the New.”*  \n- By asserting *different* Gods, the teaching violates **1 John 4:8** “God is love” – it attributes “evil” to the God of the OT, which is impossible if God *is* love.\n\n### 2.2. Mischaracterizes **God’s Wrath**  \n\n- **Wrath** in Scripture is not “evil” or “vengeful in a capricious sense”; it is **righteous judgment** against sin (cf. Ps 7:11; Romans 1:18).  \n- The same righteous wrath is displayed in the NT (e.g., the judgment of the rich man in the parable Luke 16:19‑31; the “wrath of God” in 1 Pet 4:17).  \n- Jesus Himself warned that “the **coming** of the Son of Man will be accompanied by **wrath**” (Matt 24:30). Thus He does **not** abrogate divine wrath; He fulfills it.\n\n### 2.3. Undermines **God’s Moral Goodness**  \n\n- Asserting that the OT God was “evil” contradicts **Revelation 15:4** “who will not be ashamed,” and **Habakkuk 1:13** “Your eye is too pure to look at evil.”  \n- In the OT, God is repeatedly described as **good** (Gen 1:31 “very good”; Ex 34:6 “good and gracious”; Psalms 145:9). The NT does not change this assessment.\n\n### 2.4. Destroys **Christ’s Role as Fulfillment**  \n\n- If the OT God is *not* the true God, then the covenants, prophecies, and sacrificial system are rendered **null** – Christ would be “inventing” a new religion rather than **fulfilling** God’s plan.  \n- The New Testament consistently presents **Jesus as the continuity** of OT salvation history (e.g., Matt 5:17 “I have not come to abolish the Law but to fulfill it”).  \n\n### 2.5. **Biblical Evidence Against the Claim**\n\n| Passage | OT Picture | NT Confirmation |\n|---------|------------|-----------------|\n| **Genesis 1:26‑27** | “Let us make man in our image.” | **John 1:14** “the Word became flesh… we have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son… full of grace and truth.” |\n| **Exodus 34:6‑7** (God’s character) | “The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious…” | **John 10:30** “I and the Father are one.” |\n| **Psalm 100:5** “For the LORD is good; his steadfast love endures forever.” | **Romans 8:28** “All things work together for good to those who love God.” |\n| **Deut 32:4** “He is the Rock, His work is perfect…” | **Heb 13:8** “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.” |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Historical Verdict: Heretical (Marcionite)\n\n| Council/Church Father | Verdict on Dualistic Claims |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Irenaeus, *Against Heresies* (c. 180)** | Condemned Marcion’s teaching that “the god of the law is a different, inferior god.” |\n| **Council of Nicaea (325)** | Reaffirmed *one* God in three persons; implicitly rejected any “two‑god” solution. |\n| **Athanasius, *On the Incarnation* (c. 340)** | “The Word became flesh to show that the same God who created the world is also the Savior.” |\n| **Council of Trent (1545‑63)** | Reaffirmed that “the one and only true God, who alone is the father of heaven and earth, is the same God worshipped in both Testaments.” |\n\nThus the statement sits **outside the boundaries of historic Christian orthodoxy**. It is a **heretical formulation** because it:\n\n1. **Denies the singular, unchangeable nature of God** (violating biblical teaching and the Creeds).  \n2. **Attribues evil to God**, contradicting the foundational biblical claim that God is *perfectly good* (cf. Psalm 145:9; James 1:17).  \n3. **Separates Christ from the covenantal Father**, effectively discarding the entire salvific narrative of the OT.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to Respond Theologically (Pastoral & Academic)\n\n1. **Affirm Unity** – Emphasize that “the God who gave the law is the same God who sent Christ” (Matt 5:17; Heb 1:8‑10).  \n2. **Explain “Wrath” Properly** – Teach that divine wrath is a **just response to sin**, rooted in love (cf. Romans 2:4‑5).  \n3. **Show Continuity of Moral Goodness** – Point out that the OT repeatedly describes God as **good, merciful, and faithful**; the NT repeats the same.  \n4. **Use the Doctrine of Progressive Revelation** – Explain that God’s self‑revelation deepens, not changes: the *person* of God is the same, but the *means* of revelation (law → gospel) evolve.  \n5. **Cite Creeds and Councils** – In dialogues with those holding this view, bring the Nicene Creed, the Apostles’ Creed, and the early church fathers’ refutations of Marcionism.  \n6. **Pastoral Sensitivity** – Recognize that genuine doubts often arise from interpreting “wrath” or “judgment” without a holistic biblical lens; guide toward a biblical theology of a **holistic God of love and justice**.\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\nThe claim that the OT God is a different, evil, wrathful deity that is replaced by the “true” God revealed in Jesus is **heretical** (Marcionite). It contradicts the biblical teaching of **one unchanging God**, the **consistent nature of God’s attributes**, and the **continuity of divine revelation** from the Old Testament to the New. Orthodox Christianity holds that the same holy, just, merciful, and loving God who acted in the OT is the very Father Jesus reveals and fulfills.",

It accurately explains why denying OT God’s goodness or reinterpreting wrath as evil undermines core biblical and historical Christian teaching. The main strength is its biblically grounded articulation and historical-orthodox framing. The still-useful but minor issues are primarily historical-citation nuances (Marcionite condemnation sources), a slight textual paraphrase of Hebrews, and the transfer of a nuanced doctrinal term ('progressive revelation') into a more formal asserted creed-like stance. Overall, the assessment remains faithful to orthodox Christianity with only small historiographical and philological cautions."
