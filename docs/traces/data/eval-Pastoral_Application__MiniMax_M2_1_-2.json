This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "# A Pastor's Response to Cohabiting Christians\n\nDear friends, thank you for coming to talk with me about this. I want you to know that I appreciate your willingness to ask the question, and I sense that underneath it, there's a real desire to honor God in your relationship. That matters to me, and I believe it matters to Him too. Let me share some thoughts with you as a brother in Christ who cares about your souls and your future together.\n\n## I Hear the Question Behind Your Words\n\nWhen you ask \"is this really wrong?\" I think you're asking several questions at once. You're asking about biblical command, yes—but you're also asking about the shape of your daily life, the trajectory of your relationship, and whether God's Word speaks to the actual world you live in. You mentioned that everyone does it now, and you're committed to each other. Those aren't throwaway comments. They're the real texture of your wrestling, and I don't want to treat them lightly.\n\nI also hear a bit of defensiveness, which I completely understand. You love each other. You're not out partying or living recklessly. You've built a life together, and it feels good and right in most ways. The last thing you want is for someone to make you feel like you're terrible people. I want to be clear from the start: I'm not here to condemn you. I'm here to help you see what I see from Scripture and from years of walking with couples through marriage and its challenges—not to pile guilt on you, but to offer you something better.\n\n## What Scripture Actually Says\n\nLet me be honest with you: the Bible doesn't have a verse that says \"thou shalt not live together before marriage.\" The specific cultural practice of cohabitation as a trial period or financial arrangement isn't directly addressed in the text. But Scripture does address the principles underneath this question with remarkable clarity and consistency, and I don't think we can honestly follow Jesus while ignoring those principles.\n\nThe Apostle Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 6:18-20 with striking urgency: \"Flee sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.\" Paul doesn't soften this. He doesn't say \"if it feels right\" or \"if you're committed.\" He says flee—run from it—because your body is fundamentally oriented toward God's glory, and sexual sin is unique in how it violates that purpose.\n\nThen there's Hebrews 13:4, which declares that \"marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure.\" This verse assumes a clear boundary: the sexual relationship belongs within marriage. The author isn't giving room for exceptions based on how committed couples feel or how long they've been together. The bed is pure within marriage, and outside of it, it isn't.\n\nPerhaps most directly relevant is 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5: \"For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God.\" Notice that Paul assumes Christians *can* control themselves. He doesn't treat sexual desire as something so powerful that it necessitates cohabitation. He calls believers to self-control as part of their sanctification—as part of becoming more like Christ.\n\nAnd in 1 Corinthians 7:9, Paul writes that if people \"cannot exercise self-control, they should marry.\" This is crucial. Paul acknowledges that sexual desire is real and powerful, but his solution is marriage, not cohabitation. He doesn't say \"find a way to be together physically while testing the relationship.\" He points to the covenant of marriage as the appropriate context for sexual expression.\n\n## But We're Committed to Each Other\n\nI want to sit with this phrase for a moment because it's both beautiful and, I think, revealing. You're committed to each other. That speaks to something real—something I don't want to dismiss. The commitment you feel is not nothing. But here's what I'm gently asking you to consider: commitment without covenant is not what God designed for sexual intimacy.\n\nWhen you say you're committed, you mean you intend to stay together. But marriage is more than intention. It's a public covenant before God and community. It's a leaving and a cleaving, as Genesis 2:24 describes it—a permanent union that creates something new. Cohabitation without that covenant actually mimics marriage while refusing its full weight. It wants the intimacy without the commitment, the benefits without the vow.\n\nI wonder if there's a part of this that isn't really about testing compatibility at all, but about avoiding the vulnerability of full commitment. Marriage is terrifying for everyone—not because it's bad, but because it asks us to give ourselves away completely. Cohabitation can become a way of having almost everything while holding back the one thing that would make the relationship fully whole before God.\n\nAnd I say this with great compassion: if you were truly committed in the way marriage demands, what would be the barrier to actually marrying? If your commitment is real and lasting, what are you waiting for? I'm not asking that flippantly. I know there can be practical barriers—finances, family situations, timing. But if those are the real issues, then living as if you're married while being unable to actually get married creates a kind of tension that Scripture doesn't ask you to live in.\n\n## The \"Everyone Does It\" Argument\n\nI want to address the cultural reality you've named. Yes, cohabitation is common now. In many circles, it's assumed. The question is whether the majority practice determines what's right, or whether God's Word does. I don't think I need to tell you that the majority was wrong when they ignored God's clear commands throughout Israel's history. The crowd frequently gets it wrong.\n\nBut more than that, I want to point out something that might be uncomfortable: the fact that everyone does it doesn't make it feel less wrong to you. That's why you're here talking to me. There's a conviction in your heart—maybe faint, maybe you've been trying to quiet it—that's asking this question. That's the Holy Spirit speaking. Don't quench that voice. It's trying to lead you toward something better.\n\nAlso consider: just because something is common doesn't make it wise. People do all kinds of things that are culturally normalized but spiritually damaging. The question isn't \"will anyone notice?\" or \"will anyone judge?\" The question is \"what does God want for us, and how do we get there?\"\n\n## A Word of Hope\n\nI want to end not with a hammer, but with hope. I genuinely believe that God has something better for you than the path you're currently on—not because your love isn't real, but because real love deserves the full blessing that God wants to give it.\n\nIf you were to step back from your current living situation and pursue marriage with intention—not as a finish line you've already crossed, but as a destination you're walking toward together—I believe you'd find that your relationship deepens rather than suffers. You'd discover that the sexual intimacy you share has more meaning, not less, when it exists within the covenant God designed. You'd experience a freedom from the quiet tension of living in a way that doesn't quite line up with what you believe.\n\nI'm not suggesting this is easy. Changing course always costs something. But I can tell you from watching many couples navigate this that the ones who choose God's design over cultural conformity rarely regret it. They look back and see that what felt like a sacrifice was actually a gift.\n\nIf barriers to marriage feel real to you—financial, familial, relational—let's talk about those. Perhaps there are steps you can take together to remove them. Perhaps counseling would help you understand what you're really waiting for. Perhaps there's fear to be dealt with, or wounds from family history that need healing. I want to help you with all of that, not just tell you what you're doing wrong.\n\n## My Prayer for You\n\nI'm praying for you as I write this. I pray that you'd have ears to hear what the Spirit is saying, not to condemn you but to lead you into all truth. I pray that you'd experience the freedom that comes from aligning your life with God's good design. I pray that your love for each other would grow deeper and stronger as you pursue holiness together.\n\nYou came asking if this is really wrong. Yes, I believe it is—not because I'm against you, but because I'm for you, and because God is for you, and He has something better. The question now is what you'll do with that truth. I'm here to walk alongside you whatever you decide. You're not alone in this.\n\nWith pastoral care and hope,\nYour Pastor",

It correctly notes that premarital cohabitation is not mandated or endorsed in explicit command form, and it emphasizes covenantal holiness, self-control, and the public, binding nature of marriage. The pastoral tone is compassionate and aims to guide toward marriage or lawful separation, rather than condemnation, which is appropriate pastorally. Nuance is well-handled: it engages with the cultural context (“everyone does it”), distinguishes commitment from covenant, and acknowledges practical barriers while offering concrete paths (counseling, waiting for marriage). Potential minor caveats (not errors) include the explicit claim that there is no verse against cohabitation; while broadly accurate, some readers will interpret biblical ethics (porneia, and the “marriage bed” principle) as addressing premarital living arrangements implicitly. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."
