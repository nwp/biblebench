    "expected": "This directly contradicts the exclusivity of Christ for salvation, a non-negotiable Christian doctrine. Jesus declared, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me' (John 14:6). Peter proclaimed, 'there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved' (Acts 4:12). While Christians can appreciate truth wherever it's found and must treat people of all faiths with respect, orthodox Christianity maintains that Jesus Christ is the unique Son of God whose death and resurrection provides the only way of reconciliation with God. Unitarianism's rejection of Christ's unique necessity for salvation places it outside Christian orthodoxy, despite its historical connections.",

          "rationale": "The answer accurately contrasts historic Christian exclusivism with UU pluralism and notes key doctrinal differences (Christology, salvation, pluralism). It aligns with biblical teaching on exclusivity while acknowledging nuance. However, it overgeneralizes UU as a uniform rejection of Christ and as definitively 'post-Christian,' which are contested characterizations. It also omits the internal diversity within UU (e.g., universalist strands) and does not provide explicit scriptural citations, though its claims are orthodox-friendly. Overall evaluation: mostly accurate with notable scope and nuance gaps."
