    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity affirms the bodily, physical resurrection of Jesus as essential to the faith (1 Corinthians 15:14). Jesus appeared in a physical body that could be touched (Luke 24:39, John 20:27), ate food (Luke 24:42-43), and still bore the crucifixion wounds. The empty tomb accounts confirm the body was gone because Jesus was raised, not that it was discarded. Jesus explicitly denied being merely a spirit: 'a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have' (Luke 24:39). The physical resurrection guarantees believers' future bodily resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:20-23) and validates Jesus' victory over death. Denying the physical resurrection undermines the gospel.",
