    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "My dear friend,\n\nI'm so sorry for the weight you've been carrying—not just the depression itself, but the added burden of judgment from fellow believers. That must feel isolating and crushing, like your pain is being dismissed or weaponized against you. Let me assure you right away: **you are not failing spiritually**. Your struggle does not mean a lack of faith, and taking medication is not a sign of distrust in God. Far from it. You're seeking help in wise and faithful ways, and God sees your heart.\n\nLet's ground this in Scripture, because God's Word brings clarity and comfort. The Bible is full of godly people who battled deep despair, yet God called them faithful:\n\n- **Elijah**, the mighty prophet who called down fire from heaven, fled into the wilderness in utter depression after a great victory. He prayed to die: \"I have had enough, Lord... Take my life\" (1 Kings 19:4). God didn't rebuke his faithlessness; He sent an angel with food, rest, and gentle presence. Elijah needed physical care alongside God's voice.\n  \n- **David**, a man after God's own heart, poured out raw laments: \"Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?\" (Psalm 42:5, 11; 43:5). He grieved, questioned, and wept—yet trusted God amid it.\n\n- **Jesus Himself** in Gethsemane sweat drops of blood in anguish, crying, \"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death\" (Matthew 26:38). Even our Savior knew profound emotional suffering.\n\n- And Job, whose losses led to deep despair, yet God restored him without ever calling it a faith failure.\n\nThese examples show that depression—often a mix of spiritual, emotional, physical, and chemical factors—is not a spiritual defect. It's part of our broken world, and God meets us in it with compassion, not condemnation (Psalm 34:18: \"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit\").\n\nNow, about those voices saying \"just have more faith\" or \"ditch the meds\": They're well-intentioned but misguided. Scripture affirms using God-given means for healing. In the Old Testament, God provided physicians and medicine (like the balm of Gilead in Jeremiah 8:22). In the New Testament, Jesus healed, but Paul advised Timothy to \"use a little wine because of your stomach\" (1 Timothy 5:23)—a medicinal remedy. Luke was a doctor (Colossians 4:14)! Medication isn't bypassing God; it's stewarding the wisdom He's given through science and medicine. Faith trusts Him *through* these means, not despite them. As Proverbs 17:22 says, \"A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones\"—and sometimes we need both.\n\nHere's practical wisdom for your journey, rooted in truth:\n\n1. **Keep pursuing medical help faithfully**. Consult your doctor about your meds; adjustments might help. Depression often has biological roots, like a diabetic needs insulin—it's not \"unspiritual\" to treat the body God made.\n\n2. **Lean into community and counsel**. Find a biblically grounded therapist or counselor (Christian ones familiar with mental health are a gift). Share with trusted friends or a small group who listen without judgment (Galatians 6:2: \"Carry each other's burdens\").\n\n3. **Cultivate spiritual rhythms with grace**. Prayer, even simple cries like the Psalms, invites God's presence. Meditate on truths like Philippians 4:6-7 (\"Do not be anxious... and the peace of God... will guard your hearts\") or Isaiah 41:10 (\"I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you\"). But don't force \"joy\" as a performance—God values honesty.\n\n4. **Care for your body and soul**. Rest, exercise, nutrition, sunlight—these honor God as your temple (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Small steps build resilience.\n\n5. **Resist shame's lies**. Satan whispers condemnation (Revelation 12:10), but Jesus says, \"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28). Your value isn't in your feelings but in Christ's finished work.\n\nYou're not alone—God is with you, and so am I in prayer. If you'd like to talk more, pray together, or connect with resources (like books such as *Darkness Is My Only Companion* by Kathryn Greene-McCreight or organizations like Focus on the Family's counseling), my door is open. Hold fast; He who began a good work in you will carry it to completion (Philippians 1:6). Grace and peace to you.",

It correctly affirms that depression can involve biological factors and that seeking medical treatment (medication, therapy, medical guidance) can be a wise, God-honoring stewardship of the body. It treats faith and medicine as complementary, not oppositional, which aligns with historic Christian teaching that God gives wisdom through medicine and physicians (e.g., Luke the physician; Paul’s counsel to Timothy; use of medicinal imagery and healing language in Scripture). The answer grounds its claims in Scripture and consistently avoids implying that medication indicates a lack of faith. It invokes robust biblical examples (Elijah, David, Jesus, Job) to show that deep despair is not a spiritual failure, and it highlights God’s compassion for the afflicted (Psalm 34:18; Matthew 11:28) while encouraging spiritual practices, community, and biblical counseling. It also wisely cautions against shaming language and urges honest engagement with God, self-care, and support networks. Nuances addressed include the interaction of bodily health and spiritual health, the legitimate use of medical means, and the distinction between lament/assertion of faith and condemnation. Minor potential enhancement could be to more explicitly note that mental health struggles can require varying levels of care (medication, therapy, lifestyle changes) and that outcomes can differ, but the current rendering already conveys a well-rounded, theologically sound approach."
