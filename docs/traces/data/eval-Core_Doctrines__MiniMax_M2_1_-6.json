    "expected": "The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became human, lived a perfect life, died on the cross as a substitute for sinners, rose from the dead, and now offers salvation and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe in him. It proclaims that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, not earned by human effort, received through faith in Christ alone.",
    "output": "# The Gospel: The Good News of Salvation\n\n## The Meaning of \"Gospel\"\n\nThe word \"gospel\" comes from the Old English \"godspel,\" which translates the Greek word *euangelion* (εὐαγγέλιον). This compound term literally means \"good message\" or \"good news\"—*eu* meaning \"good\" and *angelion* meaning \"message\" or \"announcement.\" In the ancient world, this term was used to describe announcements of victory in battle, the birth of emperors, or other significant proclamations that brought joy and hope to those who received them.\n\nWhen the biblical writers appropriated this term, they imbued it with profound theological significance. The gospel is not merely good advice or helpful suggestions; it is the *announcement* of what God has accomplished for humanity's salvation. It is news—something that has happened—rather than a set of instructions or moral imperatives to be obeyed.\n\n## The Biblical Foundation\n\nThe gospel finds its ultimate authority in the Scriptures, where it is presented as God's power for salvation. The apostle Paul declares that the gospel is \"the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes\" (Romans 1:16). This good news is not a human invention but a divine revelation, \"the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation\" (Ephesians 1:13).\n\nJesus himself inaugurated his ministry by proclaiming the gospel. In the synagogue at Nazareth, he stood up and declared, \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor\" (Luke 4:18). This quotation from Isaiah 61 establishes the messianic mission: the Anointed One has come to bring the good news of liberation, healing, and restoration.\n\n## The Essential Content of the Gospel\n\nThe gospel, as presented in the New Testament, contains several interconnected elements that together comprise the full scope of God's saving work.\n\n### The Kingdom of God\n\nAt the heart of Jesus' proclamation was the announcement that the kingdom of God had arrived. This phrase—\"the kingdom of God\" or \"the kingdom of heaven\"—appears in all four Gospels and encapsulates the reign of God breaking into human history. The kingdom represents God's sovereign authority being exercised over creation, where his will is perfectly accomplished. Jesus taught his disciples to pray, \"Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven\" (Matthew 6:10), and he declared that \"the kingdom of God is at hand\" (Mark 1:15).\n\n### The Person and Work of Christ\n\nThe gospel is fundamentally *about* Jesus Christ. Paul summarizes his gospel as simply \"Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures\" (1 Corinthians 15:3). This statement captures the essential elements: Christ's death, the reason for it (for our sins), and its fulfillment of Scripture. The gospel proclaims that Jesus of Nazareth is the long-awaited Messiah, fully divine and fully human, who lived a perfect life, died a sacrificial death, and rose victorious over death.\n\nThe death of Christ is central because it addresses the fundamental problem of human guilt. Scripture teaches that all human beings have sinned and fall short of God's glory (Romans 3:23), and the just penalty for sin is death and separation from God (Romans 6:23). Christ's death on the cross served as the atoning sacrifice, satisfying divine justice while extending divine mercy. As the prophet Isaiah foretold, \"He was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed\" (Isaiah 53:5).\n\nThe resurrection validates Christ's identity and work, demonstrating that his death was not merely martyrdom but the voluntary sacrifice that accomplished redemption. Paul insists that if Christ was not raised, the Christian faith is futile and believers are still in their sins (1 Corinthians 15:17). The resurrection proclaims that death has been defeated, that the Son of God has conquered the grave, and that eternal life is now available to all who trust in him.\n\n### The Call to Repentance and Faith\n\nThe gospel demands a response. Throughout his ministry, Jesus called people to repentance—a complete change of mind and direction away from sin and toward God. \"The time is fulfilled,\" he announced, \"and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe the gospel\" (Mark 1:15). Repentance involves not merely feeling sorry for sin but turning from it, acknowledging that one has violated God's law and deserves his judgment, and embracing a new direction in life.\n\nSaving faith involves more than intellectual assent to historical facts. It is trusting in Christ alone for salvation, relying not on one's own righteousness but on what Christ has accomplished. The New Testament presents salvation as a gift received by faith, not something earned by works: \"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast\" (Ephesians 2:8-9). Yet genuine faith inevitably produces transformation, as those who have been united with Christ are made new creations (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\n## The Scope of the Gospel\n\nThe gospel addresses the whole human predicament. Sin has affected every dimension of human existence—our relationship with God, with others, with ourselves, and with the created order. Therefore, the gospel offers comprehensive restoration.\n\nThe gospel reconciles estranged sinners to a holy God, establishing a relationship where once there was enmity. It liberates those bound by addiction, fear, and the power of sin, offering true freedom. It gives meaning and purpose to human existence, redirecting life toward the glory of God and the flourishing of his creation. It provides hope in the midst of suffering, assuring believers that the present pain is not the final word. And it offers the promise of resurrection and eternal life, when God will make all things new (Revelation 21:5).\n\n## The Gospel and the Church\n\nThe church exists as the community that received the gospel and is called to proclaim it. Jesus commissioned his disciples to go into all the world, making disciples of all nations, baptizing and teaching them (Matthew 28:19-20). The church is the \"pillar and support of the truth\" (1 Timothy 3:15), entrusted with the deposit of the gospel and called to guard it faithfully.\n\nWithin the Christian community, the gospel shapes every dimension of life—worship, fellowship, mission, ethics, and identity. The great themes of the gospel—grace, forgiveness, reconciliation, new life—permeate the life of the church and overflow into the world it is called to serve.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe gospel is the center of the Christian faith—the good news that God, in his great love and mercy, has acted in history to rescue a lost and fallen world. Through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, salvation is offered to all who will turn from their sins and trust in him. This message, simple yet profound, has transformed countless lives throughout history and continues to offer hope, healing, and new life to all who receive it. As Paul wrote, \"I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes\" (Romans 1:16).",

          "rationale": "The response accurately presents the gospel in line with historic evangelical orthodoxy: the gospel as good news about what God has accomplished in Christ (incarnation, substitutionary death for sins, resurrection), the necessity of repentance and faith, justification by grace through faith (not by works), and the transformation that follows. It correctly anchors these claims in key Scripture passages (Romans 1:16; 1 Corinthians 15:3; Ephesians 2:8–9; Luke 4:18; Isaiah 53:5; etc.) and highlights the church’s role in proclaiming the gospel (Matthew 28:19–20; 1 Timothy 3:15). It also acknowledges the central elements of the kingdom, substitutionary atonement, and new creation/reconciliation. A minor nuance worth noting is the statement that the kingdom “had arrived”; the NT emphasizes the already/not yet tension (already present in Christ but not fully realized until the future consummation). Overall, the content is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and captures essential theological distinctions (grace, faith apart from works, justification, redemption, and renewal)."
