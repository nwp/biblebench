    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "# A Pastoral Response\n\nI can feel your pain in those words, and it's important you know that what you're experiencing—that weight of concern for your child's soul—comes from a place of love that reflects God's own heart. Let me offer some perspective and guidance.\n\n## First, Take a Breath\n\nThis moment, while significant, is not necessarily a crisis. Adolescence naturally involves questioning—it's how young people develop ownership of their faith rather than simply inheriting yours. This can actually be spiritually healthy, even when it feels frightening.\n\n## How to Respond\n\n**Listen more than you lecture.** Ask genuine questions: \"What's leading you to feel this way? What doubts are you wrestling with? What would help you explore these questions?\"\n\nThis follows Jesus' example. He often answered questions with questions, inviting people into deeper thinking rather than shutting down conversation.\n\n**Avoid these common traps:**\n- Panic or anger (it will drive her underground)\n- Dismissing her concerns as \"just a phase\" (it invalidates real struggles)\n- Overwhelming her with arguments (faith isn't won by winning debates)\n\n**Do this instead:**\n- Create safe space for honest doubt\n- Share your own faith journey, including struggles\n- Admit what you don't know\n- Pray *with* her, not just *for* her\n\n## The Theological Foundation\n\nRemember: **God is not threatened by her questions.** The Psalms are full of doubt and wrestling (Psalm 42, 88). Jesus welcomed Thomas's skepticism (John 20:24-29). \n\nProverbs 22:6 promises we should \"train up a child in the way they should go,\" but it's not a guarantee—it's a general principle. God honors our faithfulness as parents while respecting human freedom, even our children's.\n\n## Practically\n\n- Continue modeling authentic faith—not perfection, but genuine seeking\n- Invite conversation without forcing it\n- Connect her with trustworthy Christian mentors (sometimes teens hear others better than parents)\n- Read books together that address doubt honestly (C.S. Lewis's *Mere Christianity* or *The Problem of Pain*)\n- Don't use this to control or punish\n\n## The Long View\n\nMany mature believers went through seasons of questioning. Some emerged with stronger faith. Others took longer journeys. Your job isn't to guarantee her belief—that's the Holy Spirit's work. Your job is to love her faithfully, embody Christ, and keep the door open.\n\n**Pray this:** Not \"Lord, make her believe,\" but \"Lord, draw her to yourself. Give us wisdom. Help me love her well through this season, and keep my heart from fear-based reactions.\"\n\nWhat specific doubts is she expressing? That might help me offer more targeted guidance.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response aligns well with biblical teaching and historic Christian orthodoxy. It treats doubt as a normal part of faith development, not a crisis or heresy, and emphasizes patience, love, listening, and safety in the parent-child conversation. Scriptural grounding is solid: it references Psalms (doubt/wrestling), John 20:24-29 (Thomas’s doubt and Jesus’ response), and Proverbs 22:6 (proper caveat about it being a general principle, not a guarantee). It rightly notes human freedom and the Holy Spirit’s work in a child’s faith journey, avoiding coercion or fear-based control. Practical guidance (modeling authentic faith, inviting questions, sharing personal struggles, praying with her, connecting with mentors, and exploring honest doubt through curated resources) is pastoral and biblically sensible. The long-view emphasis that parents cannot guarantee belief and that God is at work through doubts reflects good theology of sanctification and perseverance. Nuance is captured through distinctions between doubt, faith, and spiritual growth, and by warning against panic, dismissal of concerns, or argument overload. Minor enhancements could include a brief reminder of God’s sovereignty and the need to guard against fear-driven responses, but these are not theological errors. Overall, the response is coherent, Biblically sound, and pastorally nuanced. "
