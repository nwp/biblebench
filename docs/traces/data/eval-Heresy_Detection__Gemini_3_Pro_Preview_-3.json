    "expected": "This is the heresy of Docetism. It denies the true humanity of Christ. Orthodox Christianity teaches the hypostatic union - Jesus is fully God AND fully human. He had a real physical body, experienced hunger, thirst, fatigue, and truly died on the cross. 1 John 4:2-3 explicitly condemns denying that Jesus came in the flesh, and Hebrews 2:17 states he had to be made fully human to be our high priest.",
    "output": "Based on the theological tenets of historic Christianity, the statement provided represents a **heresy known as Docetism.**\n\nHere is a detailed theological evaluation of the teaching, including its historical context, why it deviates from orthodoxy, and the specific doctrines it violates.\n\n### 1. Identification: Docetism\nThe teaching that Jesus \"only seemed\" to have a body derives from the Greek word *dokein* (δοκεῖν), which means \"to seem\" or \"to appear.\"\n\nDocetism was one of the earliest heresies faced by the Church, gaining prominence in the late first and second centuries. It was often closely associated with **Gnosticism**, a dualistic worldview that viewed the spiritual realm as good and the physical/material realm as inherently evil or corrupt. Consequently, Docetists believed that a perfect, holy God could not defile Himself by inhabiting a physical body made of corrupt matter. Therefore, they argued, Jesus’ physical body was an illusion—a phantom or hologram that looked human but lacked substance.\n\n### 2. Contradiction of Orthodox Doctrine\nOrthodox Christian teaching asserts the **Hypostatic Union**: that Jesus Christ is one person possessing two distinct natures—truly God and truly man. This teaching is rooted in Scripture and codified in the ecumenical creeds (specifically the Councils of Nicaea in 325 AD and Chalcedon in 451 AD).\n\nThe statement violates orthodoxy in the following ways:\n\n**A. Denial of the Incarnation**\n*   **Orthodoxy:** John 1:14 states, *\"The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.\"*\n*   **The Error:** Docetism essentially claims the Word became *an illusion*, not flesh. It denies the reality of the Incarnation, which is the foundational event of the Christian faith.\n\n**B. Denial of the Passion and Resurrection**\n*   **Orthodoxy:** The Apostles' Creed affirms that Jesus \"suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried.\" The bodily resurrection is the linchpin of the faith (1 Corinthians 15).\n*   **The Error:** If Jesus was purely spiritual and had no physical body, He could not physically suffer, bleed, or die. If He did not die, He could not be resurrected. Docetism turns the Passion into a theatrical performance rather than a redemptive sacrifice.\n\n**C. Apostolic Condemnation**\nThe Apostles specifically addressed and condemned this view in the New Testament. The Apostle John wrote directly against early forms of Docetism in his first epistle:\n> \"By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist...\" (1 John 4:2–3, ESV).\n\n### 3. The Soteriological Problem (Why it matters for Salvation)\nTheologically, heresy is rarely just an academic error; it usually destroys the logic of salvation. The Church Fathers argued typically against Docetism using the principle: **\"That which is not assumed is not healed.\"** (A maxim made famous by St. Gregory of Nazianzus).\n\n*   **The Argument:** Humanity is fallen in body, mind, and soul. To redeem humanity, Jesus had to take on complete human nature (body, mind, and soul) to sanctify it and bridge the gap to God.\n*   **The Consequence:** If Jesus did not have a real human body, He did not redeem our human bodies. If His suffering was an illusion, the atonement for sin was fake. Therefore, under Docetism, humanity remains unredeemed.\n\n### 4. Historical Response\nEarly Church Fathers such as **Ignatius of Antioch** (c. 35–107 AD) fought vigorously against this teaching. On his way to martyrdom, Ignatius wrote to the Trallians:\n\n> \"Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with Jesus Christ... who was truly born, both ate and drank, was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate, was truly crucified and died... who also was truly raised from the dead.\"\n\n### Verdict\nThe statement is **Heresy**.\n\nIt creates a \"Christ\" who is a deceptive phantasm rather than the Incarnate God. It nullifies the historical reality of the Gospel narratives, contradicts the direct testimony of the Apostles, and undermines the theology of the Atonement.",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the statement as Docetism and explains why it is contrary to orthodox Christian teaching. It accurately describes the Incarnation (the Word became flesh), the necessity of true humanity for the atonement, and the biblical basis for affirming Jesus’ real humanity (John 1:14; 1 John 4:2-3; Hebrews 2:17). It also situates Docetism within its historical context (Gnosticism) and references patristic argument ( Gregory of Nazianzus) and church history (Ignatius) to support the proper view. The discussion of the hypostatic union is appropriate, and the soteriological implications (the denial undermines the atonement) are correct. Minor nuance could be added by noting more explicit scriptural anchors for the Incarnation (e.g., Colossians 2:9 or Philippians 2:6-11) and by clarifying that the formulation of hypostatic union is most precisely articulated at Chalcedon (with Nicaea addressing the divinity of the Son). Overall, the answer is doctrineally sound, biblically grounded, and captures the key theological nuances."
