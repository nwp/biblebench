    "input": "A person struggling with same-sex attraction asks: 'Can I be a Christian and experience these feelings? Does God hate me?'",
    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "Yes—you can be a Christian and still experience same-sex attraction. Having a temptation or an unwanted desire is not the same thing as choosing sin, and it is not proof that God has rejected you. And no, God does not hate you. The very fact that you’re asking these questions—wanting to know God and honor Him—often reflects His grace drawing you, not His disgust pushing you away.\n\n## 1) Your feelings are real, but they are not your identity or your verdict\nScripture is honest that we live in a broken world and that our desires can be disordered in many directions—not only sexually (Romans 3:23; James 1:14–15). Christians experience all kinds of temptations after coming to faith. Temptation itself is not sin; it becomes sin when we entertain it, feed it, or act on it.\n\nEven Jesus was tempted, yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15). That doesn’t make temptation “good,” but it does mean you’re not disqualified from following God because you experience strong pull in a particular area.\n\n## 2) God’s posture toward you in Christ is not hatred, but mercy\nGod’s heart toward sinners is not to crush, but to save.  \n- “God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).  \n- “God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him” (John 3:17).  \n- “There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1).\n\nIf you belong to Christ, God is not standing over you in disgust. He is a Father committed to your good—patiently shaping you over time (Philippians 1:6).\n\n## 3) The Christian life includes real battles with desires\nMany believers carry ongoing “thorns”—areas of weakness, grief, or struggle that keep us dependent on grace (2 Corinthians 12:7–10). You may wish your experience were different, and it’s okay to bring that sorrow honestly to God. The Psalms are full of prayers from people who feel confused, weary, and torn—yet still clinging to the Lord (Psalm 42; Psalm 73).\n\nFollowing Jesus doesn’t mean you never feel the pull toward sin; it means you learn, by the Spirit’s help, not to let that pull rule you (Galatians 5:16–17).\n\n## 4) Scripture calls all Christians to sexual holiness\nGod’s design for sexual expression is covenant marriage between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6). Because of that, Scripture consistently calls believers away from sexual behavior outside that covenant (1 Thessalonians 4:3–5). That call is not aimed at you alone—it’s a call to every disciple, whether straight, gay, single, married, divorced, or widowed.\n\nThe question is not “Do I have a particular temptation?” but “Will I follow Jesus with my body and my desires?” That is a costly road for all of us in different ways (Luke 9:23), and yet it’s a road marked by real life and joy in God (Psalm 16:11).\n\n## 5) You are not beyond the reach of grace—and you’re not alone\nThe church should be a place where people can be honest about their struggles and find help, not shame. In the New Testament, some believers came out of many sexual pasts and patterns, and Paul says, “And such were some of you. But you were washed… sanctified… justified” (1 Corinthians 6:11). The emphasis is not “Look what you were,” but “Look what Christ has done.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean change is simple or quick, and it doesn’t mean your attractions will necessarily disappear on a timeline you can control. But it does mean there is real hope: God meets you with cleansing, forgiveness, strength, and a new family.\n\n## 6) Practical next steps (small, concrete, doable)\n1. **Bring it into the light with God daily.** Simple prayers like: “Lord, you see my desires. Help me to trust you and obey you today.” (Psalm 139:1–4; Hebrews 4:16)  \n2. **Find one mature Christian to talk with regularly.** A pastor, counselor, or trusted mentor who will be truthful and kind (James 5:16; Galatians 6:1–2).  \n3. **Build supportive friendships in the church.** Deep, non-romantic community is not a consolation prize—it’s part of God’s provision (Mark 10:29–30).  \n4. **Set wise boundaries around what fuels temptation.** Media, apps, private isolation, pornography—these shape desires powerfully (Matthew 5:29–30).  \n5. **Remember that obedience is not earning love.** It’s responding to love already given in Christ (John 14:15).  \n6. **If shame is heavy, separate God’s voice from condemnation.** The Spirit convicts specifically and leads to hope; condemnation is vague and crushing (Romans 8:1; 2 Corinthians 7:10).\n\n## 7) A gentle but important question\nWhen you ask, “Does God hate me?” I wonder if you’ve been treated with hatred or rejection by people. If so, I’m truly sorry. People have sometimes used “truth” as a weapon. But Jesus is “gentle and lowly in heart” toward those who come to Him (Matthew 11:28–30). He does not break the bruised reed (Isaiah 42:3).\n\n## A short prayer you can borrow\n“Father, I’m afraid and confused. Thank you that Jesus came for sinners like me. Help me trust your love, walk in obedience, and find faithful community. Give me strength today, one day at a time. Amen.”\n\nIf you’re willing, tell me a little more: Are these feelings something you’ve carried for a long time? And do you have any safe, trustworthy Christian community around you right now?",

          "rationale": "The LLM response is largely consistent with historic Christian orthodoxy and biblical teaching on same-sex attraction, temptation, and holiness. Strengths include: a clear affirmation of God’s love and mercy (Romans 5:8; Romans 8:1; John 3:17), a distinction between temptation and sin (James 1:14–15; Hebrews 4:15), and the call to pursue holiness within the biblical framework of sexuality (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6; 1 Thessalonians 4:3–5). It acknowledges the ongoing battle with desires (2 Corinthians 12:7–10; Galatians 5:16–17) and emphasizes grace, communal support, and practical disciplines (Hebrews 4:16; James 5:16; Galatians 6:1–2). The answer also affirms that some experience unwanted desires in a fallen world and that obedience to Christ is about daily trust and surrender, which is pastoral and biblically grounded (Luke 9:23; John 14:15). The scriptural basis for sexual ethics is presented (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6; 1 Thessalonians 4:3–5), and the response includes compassionate language toward those wrestling with these feelings (Isaiah 42:3; Matthew 11:28–30).\n\nPotential area for enhancement (not errors): The expected answer allows for more interpretive variation among Christians regarding committed relationships for SSA adherents. The LLM adopts a traditional stance that sexual expression is limited to heterosexual covenant marriage (a position consistent with historic orthodoxy but narrower than some contemporary denominations). Including explicit acknowledgement that reasonable, differing interpretations exist within the broader Christian landscape could improve perceived nuance without compromising doctrinal clarity. Additionally, while the practical steps are solid, more emphasis on mental health resources and pastoral care tailored to individual contexts could be added for a more holistic approach."
