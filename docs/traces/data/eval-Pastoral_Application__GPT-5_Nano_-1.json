    "input": "A person struggling with same-sex attraction asks: 'Can I be a Christian and experience these feelings? Does God hate me?'",
    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "I’m glad you asked this. It’s a brave, honest question, and it’s one Jesus’ people have grappled with for centuries. Let me speak plainly and gently, from Scripture and with pastoral care.\n\nCan I be a Christian and experience these feelings?\n- Yes. Being a Christian does not require erasing or pretending away your feelings. Temptations and attractions are not, in themselves, sins. Temptations are things you bring to God and ask Him to help you navigate.\n- The Bible speaks of the reality of human desires and the call to live in faithfulness to God’s design. You can be a follower of Jesus while you wrestle with same-sex attraction (SSA). What matters is how you respond to that reality—whether you seek to obey God, rely on His grace, and grow in holiness with His help, or whether you indulge what He forbids apart from repentance and grace.\n\nDoes God hate me?\n- No. God does not hate you. He loves you with an everlasting love. He knows you intimately (Psalm 139) and desires you to know His mercy and presence.\n- God hates sin because sin hurts you and others and breaks His perfect design. He does not hate you for having attractions; He invites you to bring all of who you are into His light and to walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7).\n\nBiblical framing to hold onto\n- Identity in Christ: If you are in Christ, you are a beloved child of God and, in Christ, a new creation. Your value comes from being made in God’s image and redeemed by Jesus (John 1:12; 2 Corinthians 5:17).\n- Temptation vs. sin: Temptations themselves are not sin. Sin is indulging or acting on desire in ways that violate God’s design (Matthew 5:27-28; Romans 7; 1 Corinthians 10:13).\n- The biblical sexual ethic: Scripture affirms marriage as between one man and one woman (Genesis 2; Hebrews 13:4). Acts of sexual behavior outside God’s design—whether heterosexual or homosexual—are addressed as disobedience in Scripture, not as God’s verdict on a person’s worth. The core message of the gospel is grace for the sinner and transformation by the Spirit (Romans 6-8; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11).\n- Hope for transformation and steadfast hope in grace: God’s Spirit works in us to renew our minds and empower obedience. You are not left to fight alone (Romans 12:1-2; Galatians 5:16-25).\n\nWhat might life look like as you walk this out?\n- Faithful honesty before God: Bring your feelings to Him in prayer and Scripture. Tell Him when you’re struggling, and ask for the grace to endure and to grow in holiness.\n- Rely on the Spirit, not your strength: Sanctification is a Spirit-empowered process. You will still feel pull toward attractions, but you can live in a way that honors Christ through dependence on Him (Galatians 5:16, 25).\n- Practice wise boundaries and healthy disciplines: This often means being intentional about what you consume, whom you spend time with, and what your daily rhythms look like. It can include accountability—confidential, trustworthy mentors or pastors who will pray with you and speak truth in love.\n- Cherish the church as your family: Be part of a faith community that teaches truth with grace, where you can be honest about your struggles and receive encouragement, forgiveness, and accountability (Hebrews 10:24-25).\n- Embrace your identity in Christ, not your attractions: Anchor your sense of self in being beloved by God and called to holiness, rather than letting your attractions define you.\n- Be honest about the path of obedience: The Bible does not promise instant, total removal of all same-sex attractions for everyone. It does promise God’s presence, guidance, and the power to live faithfully. Some may experience deep shifts; others may live with ongoing desires but with increasing fidelity to God’s design through the Spirit’s help (Romans 8; 2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nPractical next steps you can consider\n- Start with prayer and Scripture: Daily, short times meditating on verses like Romans 8:38-39; Psalm 139:13-16; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11; 1 Corinthians 10:13; Romans 12:2.\n- Find a trusted accountability partner or pastor: Someone you can be honest with about temptations and struggles, who will pray with you and encourage you toward holiness.\n- Seek wise counsel: A pastor or Christian counselor who understands the gospel, respects your dignity, and can help you navigate boundaries, temptations, and identity in a biblical framework.\n- Build healthy routines: Regular worship, small group fellowship, and service. Spiritual disciplines (prayer, Scripture meditation, journaling) strengthen heart and mind.\n- Make boundaries practical: If certain media, relationships, or patterns intensify temptation, set prudent boundaries. This is not about judgment; it’s about protecting your walk with Christ.\n- Be gentle with yourself, but be serious about obedience: Transformation is a process. There may be seasons of struggle; continue fixing your eyes on Jesus, who loves you and who will complete the good work He began in you (Philippians 1:6).\n\nA short word of pastoral consolation\n- You are not alone. The church is a hospital for the soul, not a courtroom. God welcomes the brokenhearted and gives grace to the humble. Your struggle is not a mark against your faith; it is a call to cling to Jesus more closely, to grow in Him, and to trust His mercy.\n- If you ever feel overwhelmed, please reach out to me or another trusted pastor. We want to walk with you, speak truth in love, celebrate what is good, and point you again to the depths of God’s love in Christ.\n\nA brief prayer you can pray today\nLord Jesus, you know my heart and you know my struggles. I bring my feelings to you, asking for your grace to live in obedience to your design. Please forgive my sins, renew my mind, and fill me with your Spirit so that I might walk in holiness and love. Help me to know you see me, love me, and accept me as your child. Give me courage to seek accountability, courage to resist temptation, and courage to trust your perfect love that casts out fear. For your glory and my good, amen.\n\nIf you’d like, we can talk more about your specific situation, share passages, and prayerfully form a small, practical plan that fits your life and your church community. You’re not alone in this. God is with you, and His grace is greater than any struggle.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response adheres closely to historic Christian orthodoxy and biblical teaching. It affirms that experiencing same-sex attraction (SSA) is not in itself sinful, distinguishes temptation from sin, and grounds identity in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17; John 1:12). It upholds a biblical sexual ethic by affirming marriage as between one man and one woman (Genesis 2; Hebrews 13:4) and stating that acts outside design are disobedience, not a judgment on the person’s worth. It emphasizes grace, divine transformation through the Spirit (Romans 6–8; Galatians 5:16–25; Romans 12:2), and the ongoing need for holiness, accountability, and community support. It maintains pastoral sensitivity, acknowledging diverse views within orthodox Christianity on how to apply biblical teaching while maintaining core truths: God’s love, identity in Christ, and the call to follow Jesus, including possible lifelong celibacy for some. Nuances included: distinction between temptation and behavior; reality of ongoing struggle for some; necessity of sanctification as Spirit-empowered, not purely self-help. The only minor caveat is that some readers may prefer a more explicit discussion of how different biblical interpretations address same-sex relationships in practice; however, the response remains biblically faithful and pastorally balanced while not redefining sin or worth."

          "rationale": "The response is doctrinally conservative but biblically grounded. It correctly treats same-sex attraction as a reality that does not disqualify one from faith in Christ, emphasizes that God loves the person, and distinguishes temptation from sin. It upholds a biblical anthropology and sexual ethic (marriage as between a man and a woman) and frames transformation as Spirit-assisted growth, not human effort alone. The pastoral tone is warm and invitational, offering concrete next steps (accounts, Scripture, worship rhythms, boundaries) and a short prayer, while inviting ongoing conversation within a church community. The overall approach balances truth and grace, though it could broaden its scope to include more explicit acknowledgment of diverse pastoral experiences within the Christian landscape and explicit mental-health resources."
