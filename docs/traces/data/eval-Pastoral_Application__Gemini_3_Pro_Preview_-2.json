    "input": "A couple asks: 'We're Christians living together before marriage. Is this really wrong? Everyone does it now, and we're committed to each other.'",
    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "It is good that you are here. The very fact that you are asking this question tells me that the Holy Spirit is active in your lives, prompting you to examine your choices in light of your faith. You are seeking to honor God, and that is a beautiful starting point.\n\nI want to answer you not with a list of rigid rules, but by looking at God’s grand and beautiful design for marriage. I know you love each other, and I can see you are serious about your future. Because of that, I want to give you counsel that protects that future and honors the One who brought you together.\n\nTo answer your question directly: While it is culturally normal, living together before marriage is not God's best for you, nor is it consistent with the biblical pattern for Christian men and women.\n\nLet’s walk through \"why\" together.\n\n### 1. The Design of Marriage: Covenant before Consummation\nIn Genesis 2:24, we see the blueprint for marriage: *\"Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.\"*\n\nNotice the order: Leaving (parents), Cleaving (covenant commitment), and then Becoming One Flesh (sexual intimacy and shared life). Living together attempts to reverse this order. It seeks the privileges of intimacy and shared life without the security and binding nature of the public covenant.\n\nIn Scripture, marriage is not just a piece of paper or a private feeling of commitment. It is a public vow before God and witnesses. It is the \"safe house\" God built for the vulnerability of total intimacy. When we play house without the vow, we are acting out the oneness of marriage without the covering of covenant protection.\n\n### 2. The Call to Be Distinct\nYou mentioned that \"everyone does it now.\" You are right; the culture has shifted. But as followers of Jesus, our standard has never been culture; our standard is Christ.\n\nPaul writes in Romans 12:2, *\"Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind.\"* The world views marriage as a contract rooted in convenience and compatibility testing. The Christian views marriage as a covenant rooted in sacrificial love and holiness.\n\nIf your relationship looks exactly like the world’s, how does it point to Christ? Your marriage is meant to be a picture of Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5). Christ did not \"test drive\" the Church; He gave Himself up for her to make her holy. By waiting, you are telling the world that your trust in God and your reverence for marriage is stronger than cultural pressure or financial convenience.\n\n### 3. Fleeing Temptation\nScripture is realistic about human drive. 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4 tells us, *\"For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor.\"*\n\nIf you are living together and sleeping together, you are engaging in the privileges of marriage without the covenant of marriage. Biblically, this falls under *porneia* (sexual immorality). If you are living together but *not* sleeping together, you are putting yourselves in a furnace of temptation that God commands us to flee. It is unwise to place yourselves in a situation where the struggle for purity is constant and overwhelming.\n\nFurthermore, we must consider our witness. Even if you maintain purity, living together creates the appearance of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22). It confuses your witness to neighbors or younger believers who look to you as examples.\n\n### 4. The Myth of the \"Test Drive\"\nThere is a practical belief that living together prevents divorce because you \"get to know the person.\" Sociologically, statistics actually suggest the opposite: couples who cohabit before engagement often have higher rates of divorce or lower marital satisfaction.\n\nWhy? Because cohabitation creates a \"sliding vs. deciding\" dynamic. You slide into marriage because the lease is up or you share furniture, rather than making a sharp, intentional decision to bind yourselves to one another. God wants your marriage to be built on intentional commitment, not inertia.\n\n### Pastoral Counsel: What Now?\n\nI know this is hard to hear. I know that moving apart is expensive, inconvenient, and feels like a step backward relationally. But obedience to God often comes with a cost—and that cost is always an investment in joy.\n\nHere is my challenge to you: **If you are truly committed to each other, honor that commitment by doing it God's way.**\n\n1.  **Separate your living situation.** I know this is a heavy ask. It might mean moving in with a friend, a distinct roommate situation, or moving back with family for a season. If finances are the only barrier, let the church know; the body of Christ is here to help those seeking to walk in holiness.\n2.  **Set a date.** If you are committed, why wait? If you know this is the person you want to marry, let’s move toward the altar. Biblical marriage doesn't require a $30,000 party; it requires a man, a woman, an officiant, and vows.\n3.  **Repent and Refresh.** If you have fallen into sexual intimacy, bring that to the Cross. There is no shame for those who are in Christ Jesus. Receive His forgiveness, and let that grace empower you to walk in purity from today until your wedding night.\n\nYou are asking, \"Is this really wrong?\" I would flip the question: \"Is this really God's best?\"\n\nI believe you want God’s blessing on your marriage. God loves to bless obedience. I urge you to trust Him, make the hard decision to move apart, and prepare for your marriage the right way. You will never regret honoring God, and you will one day tell your children and grandchildren that you loved God and each other enough to wait.\n\nI am here to walk this with you. Let’s pray.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns with biblical teaching that sexual intimacy belongs to marriage and cohabitation outside the covenant is not God’s best for His people. It correctly grounds the argument in Scripture (Gen 2:24 on covenantal union and the order of leaving, cleaving, and becoming one flesh; 1 Thess 4:3-4 on sanctification and sexual purity; 1 Thess 5:22 on avoiding appearances of evil; the broader scriptural pattern of marriage as a Christlike, public covenant). It highlights the witness implications (Eph 5; Rom 12:2) and emphasizes grace and repentance rather than judgment, which is pastorally appropriate. The response also offers practical, pastoral steps (separation or moving toward marriage, accountability, and prayer) and acknowledges cultural pressures. It notes the common claim of “test drive” is sociologically contested with a fair presentation of the potential risks, and it remains clear that obedience to God’s design is the path to flourishing. While it could have quoted 1 Cor 6:18-20 explicitly and nuanced scenarios where premarital abstinence might be pursued in limited circumstances, there are no doctrinal errors. Overall, the answer is biblically grounded, theologically sound, and nuanced in its pastoral approach."

The counseling points are practically actionable and supported by Scripture, though the tone could be modulated to ensure grace-filled reception for couples experiencing hardship, and it could better acknowledge denominational or individual boundaries in pastoral practice."
