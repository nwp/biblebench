    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of who has final authority in interpreting Scripture is a complex and debated issue in Christian theology, with different perspectives and traditions offering varying answers. A balanced and thoughtful approach to this question must consider the biblical texts, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the diverse views within Christianity.\n\nFrom a biblical perspective, the Protestant Reformation's emphasis on sola scriptura (Scripture alone) highlights the importance of the individual's direct access to and interpretation of Scripture. The Reformers argued that every believer has the right and responsibility to read and interpret the Bible for themselves, guided by the Holy Spirit (e.g., 1 Corinthians 2:10-16; 2 Timothy 3:16-17). This perspective is rooted in passages such as Matthew 23:8-10, where Jesus cautions against relying solely on human leaders for spiritual guidance, and 1 John 2:27, which states that believers have the anointing of the Holy Spirit and do not need external authorities to guide them.\n\nHowever, other biblical passages suggest that the interpretation of Scripture is not solely the domain of the individual believer. For example, 1 Corinthians 12:12-14 and Ephesians 4:11-16 emphasize the importance of the community of believers, with various gifts and roles, in understanding and applying Scripture. The early Christian church in Acts 15:1-35 demonstrates the value of ecumenical councils, where leaders from different churches gathered to discuss and resolve theological disputes.\n\nIn light of these biblical considerations, different Christian traditions have developed distinct approaches to the authority of Scripture interpretation. Some Protestant denominations emphasize the \"priesthood of all believers\" (1 Peter 2:9), suggesting that individual believers have a significant role in interpreting Scripture, guided by the Holy Spirit. In contrast, Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions place a greater emphasis on the magisterium (the teaching authority of the church) and the role of ecumenical councils in providing authoritative interpretations of Scripture.\n\nDenominational traditions and church leaders also play a significant role in shaping the interpretation of Scripture within their respective communities. While some may view these authorities as having a binding or definitive role, others see them as providing guidance and context for understanding Scripture.\n\nEcumenical councils, comprising representatives from multiple Christian traditions, have historically played a crucial role in resolving theological disputes and establishing common understandings of Scripture. The decisions of these councils, such as the Council of Nicaea (325 CE) and the Council of Chalcedon (451 CE), have been widely accepted across Christian traditions.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is no straightforward answer to the question of who has final authority in interpreting Scripture, a balanced and thoughtful approach must consider the interplay between individual believers, church leaders, denominational traditions, and ecumenical councils. The biblical texts suggest that interpretation is a communal and Spirit-guided process, with various roles and authorities contributing to a deeper understanding of Scripture. Ultimately, the authority of Scripture interpretation is a complex and multifaceted issue, with different Christian perspectives offering valuable insights and contributions to the ongoing conversation.",
