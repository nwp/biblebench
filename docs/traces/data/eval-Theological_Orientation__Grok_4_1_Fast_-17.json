    "expected": "",
    "output": "### Biblical Foundation for Environmental Stewardship\n\nChristians should view environmental stewardship—often called \"creation care\"—as a clear biblical mandate rooted in God's character, humanity's role, and the hope of redemption. The Bible portrays creation not as an autonomous entity to be worshiped but as God's good handiwork entrusted to humanity for responsible care. This is far from a modern invention or mere political tool; it's woven throughout Scripture.\n\n- **Genesis as the cornerstone**: In Genesis 1:26-28, God creates humanity in His image and grants \"dominion\" (Hebrew *radah*) over the earth. This is not a license for exploitation but a royal stewardship, mirroring God's benevolent rule. Genesis 1:31 declares all creation \"very good,\" underscoring its inherent value. Genesis 2:15 explicitly tasks Adam \"to work [Hebrew *abad*, serve/cultivate] and keep [Hebrew *shamar*, protect/guard]\" the garden—a priestly duty reflecting service to God.\n\n- **Ownership belongs to God**: Psalm 24:1 affirms, \"The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein.\" Psalm 104 celebrates God's sustaining providence over creation, from seas to storms, calling believers to praise Him for it.\n\n- **Sin's impact and redemption's promise**: The Fall corrupts human stewardship (Genesis 3), leading to thorns, toil, and groaning creation (Romans 8:19-22: \"the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God... [it] was subjected to futility\"). Yet, Christ redeems not only humans but the cosmos (Colossians 1:15-20), and Revelation 11:18 warns that God \"will destroy those who destroy the earth.\" This eschatological hope motivates care now, as a foretaste of the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 21:1-5).\n\nJesus reinforces this through parables like the talents (Matthew 25:14-30) and the shrewd manager (Luke 16:1-13), urging faithful administration of God's resources. The command to love neighbor as self (Mark 12:31) extends to protecting the vulnerable from environmental harms, echoing Old Testament laws against waste (e.g., Deuteronomy 20:19-20) and provision for the poor (Leviticus 19:9-10).\n\n### Christian Perspectives: Unity Amid Diversity\n\nWhile the biblical case is strong, Christians have debated its application, especially amid politicization:\n\n- **Affirmative voices across traditions**:\n  - **Evangelical**: The 1970 Lausanne Covenant and 2000 Johannesburg Commitment highlight creation care as integral to the gospel. Books like *Pollution and the Death of Man* (Francis Schaeffer, 1970) and *Earthkeeping in the Nineties* (Calvin DeWitt) frame it biblically. Organizations like A Rocha and the Evangelical Environmental Network (with its \"What Would Jesus Drive?\" campaign) engage climate issues without compromising orthodoxy.\n  - **Catholic**: Pope Francis' *Laudato Si'* (2015) draws deeply from Scripture, calling ecological sin a failure of fraternity.\n  - **Protestant mainline and Orthodox**: Bodies like the Anglican Communion and Eastern Orthodox emphasize *oikonomia* (household management) of God's creation.\n  - **Global South**: Many African and Latin American Christians see creation care as justice for the poor, hardest hit by degradation.\n\n- **Skeptical perspectives**: Some evangelicals, like the Cornwall Alliance (*Evangelical Declaration on Global Warming*, 2000), argue climate alarmism distracts from spiritual priorities, viewing it as politicized pseudoscience that elevates earth over souls. They cite Genesis dominion as pro-development and question IPCC models' reliability, prioritizing poverty alleviation over emission cuts.\n\nThis tension reflects broader divides: left-leaning Christians often link stewardship to progressive policies, while conservatives fear \"green idolatry\" (Romans 1:25). Yet, both sides affirm the mandate; disagreement lies in diagnosis (e.g., is anthropogenic climate change catastrophic?) and solutions.\n\n### Climate Change: Science, Humility, and Faithful Response\n\nClimate change isn't explicitly biblical—Scripture addresses stewardship broadly, not CO2 levels. Christians must engage science humbly (Proverbs 18:17: \"The one who states his case first seems right, until the other comes and examines him\"). Consensus (e.g., IPCC reports) suggests human activity warms the planet, risking harms like sea-level rise and food insecurity, but uncertainties remain on magnitude and fixes. As theologian John Frame notes, we steward data too—avoiding both denialism and doomsday panic.\n\n**Is it a political distraction?** Partly yes: Environmentalism can become ideological, pitting \"planet\" against people or gospel. But dismissing it wholesale ignores the mandate and neighbor-love (e.g., island nations or farmers facing droughts). Jesus warned against anxiety over tomorrow (Matthew 6:25-34) while commanding wise provision.\n\n**Practical guidance**:\n- **Personal**: Reduce waste, conserve energy, support sustainable farming—simple obedience to \"keep\" creation.\n- **Church**: Teach stewardship, plant trees, advocate for the vulnerable.\n- **Policy**: Favor market-friendly innovations over coercive measures; prioritize adaptation for the poor (e.g., clean water over carbon taxes).\n- **Ultimate hope**: Rest in Christ's return, not human efforts (Isaiah 65:17-25).\n\nIn sum, creation care is a biblical mandate—non-negotiable for image-bearers loving God and neighbor. Climate change invites thoughtful engagement, not partisan capture. As N.T. Wright puts it, \"Heaven and earth are made for each other,\" so Christians uniquely bridge care for both without deifying either. Let's steward faithfully, proclaiming Christ as creation's true Lord.",

It interprets dominion as responsible stewardship, not exploitation, and ties ecological concern to neighbor-love and justice for the vulnerable. At the same time, it acknowledges genuine diversity within Christian traditions, presenting affirmative voices across evangelical, Catholic, Orthodox, and global South contexts, while also listing skeptical and minority positions. It emphasizes humility before science, avoids triumphalism, and endorses practical, market-conscious approaches rather than sweeping political agendas or doctrinal departure. This balanced, ecumenical posture—insisting on biblical fidelity while allowing legitimate disagreement on application—signals a moderate-conservative orientation rather than a full-throated conservative or progressive stance.",

It treats the issue as one of legitimate disagreement about diagnosis and solutions, rather than a single orthodox political program. The piece attempts fair treatment by naming groups on both sides and describing their concerns. The tone is largely humble, emphasizing careful engagement with science, neighbor love, and prudent policy—though it does affirm the biblical mandate, which adds a firm theological anchor without being dogmatic about every policy detail."
