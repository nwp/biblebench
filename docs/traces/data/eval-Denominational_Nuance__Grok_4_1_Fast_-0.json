    "expected": "Catholics emphasize justification as a process involving faith plus works (sanctification), where grace infuses the believer and makes them actually righteous over time. Protestants emphasize justification as a one-time legal declaration where God imputes Christ's righteousness to the believer through faith alone, though they also affirm sanctification as a separate process. Both agree justification requires God's grace and Christ's work, but differ on the role of works and whether justification is declarative or transformative.",
    "output": "### Justification in Christian Theology: Catholic and Protestant Perspectives\n\nJustification is a central doctrine in Christian soteriology (the study of salvation), referring to God's gracious act of making sinners righteous in His sight through Jesus Christ. It addresses how humans, tainted by sin, are reconciled to a holy God. This topic became a flashpoint during the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, leading to enduring differences between Catholic and Protestant traditions. Both affirm that justification is rooted in God's grace through Christ's atoning death and resurrection, and that no one merits salvation by their own efforts alone (core orthodoxy per Ephesians 2:8–9). However, they diverge on *how* grace justifies, the role of faith and works, and the nature of righteousness. Below, I outline the main views accurately, drawing from authoritative sources, followed by key differences and points of convergence.\n\n#### Protestant View\nProtestants (including Lutherans, Reformed/Presbyterians, Anglicans, Baptists, and others) emphasize **justification by faith alone (sola fide)** as the article by which the church stands or falls, per Martin Luther. Key elements include:\n\n- **Forensic Declaration**: Justification is primarily a legal or judicial act where God *declares* the sinner righteous, imputing (crediting) Christ's perfect righteousness to the believer's account (Romans 4:5–8; 2 Corinthians 5:21). The believer's sins are imputed to Christ on the cross.\n- **Faith Alone as the Instrument**: Saving faith—a trust in Christ's finished work—is the sole means by which one receives this justification. Good works, obedience, or sacraments do not contribute to justification but flow from it as evidence of genuine faith (Ephesians 2:8–10; James 2:14–26 interpreted as faith producing works, not earning justification).\n- **Once-for-All Event**: Justification occurs at the moment of faith (often linked to conversion or baptism in infant-baptism traditions) and is irreversible for true believers, providing assurance of salvation (Romans 8:30; Westminster Confession of Faith, ch. 11; Augsburg Confession, Art. IV).\n- **Distinction from Sanctification**: Justification (positional righteousness before God) is distinct from sanctification (gradual growth in holiness), though the two are inseparable in the Christian life.\n\nThis view underscores God's radical grace and human inability (total depravity in Reformed thought), countering perceived medieval abuses like indulgences.\n\n#### Catholic View\nCatholic teaching, formalized at the Council of Trent (1545–1563) and elaborated in the *Catechism of the Catholic Church* (CCC 1987–2029), sees justification as a **transformative process** initiated and sustained by God's grace. Key elements include:\n\n- **Infused Righteousness**: God not only declares but *makes* the sinner righteous by infusing sanctifying grace into the soul, healing and elevating human nature (Romans 5:5; CCC 1999). Christ's merits are applied through this internal renewal.\n- **Faith and Cooperation with Works**: Initial justification comes through faith, baptism, and repentance, but it is not by \"faith alone.\" Faith must be living and cooperative, expressed through good works, love, and participation in the sacraments (e.g., Eucharist, penance), which increase justification (James 2:24; Trent Session VI, chs. 7–10). Works are empowered by grace and merit further grace.\n- **Ongoing Process**: Justification begins at baptism, can be lost through mortal sin, and regained via contrition, confession, and works of satisfaction (Trent Session VI, chs. 14–16; CCC 2010–2011). Full assurance is possible but tied to perseverance in faith and charity.\n- **Unity of Justification and Sanctification**: The two are aspects of the same reality—God's life dwelling in the believer—rather than strictly distinct.\n\nThis emphasizes the sacramental life of the Church as the ordinary means of grace, with free will cooperating under prevenient grace.\n\n#### Main Differences\nHere is a concise comparison of the core distinctions:\n\n| Aspect                  | Protestant View                          | Catholic View                            |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Means of Justification** | Faith alone (sola fide); works are fruit, not cause. | Faith formed by charity (fides caritate formata); works cooperate with grace. |\n| **Nature of Righteousness** | Imputed (external declaration; forensic). | Infused (internal transformation).      |\n| **Timing and Security** | Decisive, once-for-all event; secure for believers. | Process that begins, grows, can be lost/regained. |\n| **Role of Sacraments/Works** | Signs/seals of justification already received. | Instrumental channels that confer/ increase justifying grace. |\n| **Assurance**           | Strong, based on Christ's work and faith (Romans 8:1). | Hopeful, based on fidelity and perseverance (CCC 2005). |\n\nThese differences stem from interpretations of key texts like Romans 3–5, Galatians 2:16, and James 2, as well as views on merit, grace, and human cooperation.\n\n#### Areas of Agreement and Respectful Diversity\nBoth traditions uphold:\n- Salvation by grace alone through Christ alone (sola gratia, solus Christus).\n- The necessity of repentance and faith.\n- Good works as essential to the Christian life (Titus 2:14).\n- Scripture as authoritative (Protestants add sola scriptura).\n\nRecent ecumenical dialogues, like the 1999 *Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification* (Lutheran-Catholic) and 2017 statements involving Reformed and Methodist groups, affirm substantial convergence: both reject works-righteousness and affirm faith's primacy. Protestants respect Catholicism's emphasis on transformation and sacraments as biblical; Catholics appreciate Protestantism's focus on assurance and Christ's sufficiency.\n\nIn orthodoxy's core (e.g., Apostles' Creed), these are legitimate developments within the one faith once delivered (Jude 3). Theological diversity enriches the Body of Christ, fostering humility and mutual learning as we await Christ's return. For deeper study, consult Trent's decrees, Luther's *Freedom of a Christian*, or Calvin's *Institutes* (Book III).",

It also presents appropriate areas of agreement. The main issues are moderate misstatements or oversimplifications in terminology (prevenient grace in Catholic context), nuances around assurance, and the degree of separation or unity between justification and sanctification across traditions.
