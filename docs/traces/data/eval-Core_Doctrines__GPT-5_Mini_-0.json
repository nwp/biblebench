    "expected": "The Trinity is the Christian doctrine that God exists as three distinct persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) who are coequal and coeternal, yet remain one God in essence and substance. This is a mystery that transcends human comprehension - not three gods (tritheism) nor one person in three modes (modalism), but one God in three persons who are distinct yet inseparable in their divine nature and work.",
    "output": "Short definition\n- The doctrine of the Trinity says that the one true God is three distinct Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who together share one divine essence. God is one “what” (one divine being) and three “whos” (three distinct, personal centers of consciousness and will).\n\nBiblical basis (select texts)\n- Old Testament hints: the plural \"Let us\" in Genesis 1:26; the divine plurality in Psalm 110:1 and Genesis 3:22; theophanies/“Angel of the Lord” passages that speak as God.\n- New Testament: Jesus’ deity and distinct personhood (John 1:1–3, 14; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:3); Jesus praying to and being sent by the Father (John 17; John 5:30); the Father–Son relational language throughout the Gospels and Paul (e.g., John 3:16; Philippians 2:5–11); the Holy Spirit as a personal divine agent who teaches, guides, and can be lied to (John 14–16; Acts 5:3–4; Romans 8:9–11); explicit Trinitarian formulas (Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14).\n\nClassical formulation and technical terms\n- One essence (Greek: ousia or substantia): there is one divine nature or being — God is numerically one.\n- Three persons (Greek: hypostases or personae): Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three real, distinct personal subsistences or centers of relationality within the one divine life.\n- Homoousios: at the Council of Nicaea (325) the Son was affirmed as “of the same essence” with the Father—fully divine, not a creature.\n- Relations of origin: the Father is unoriginated, the Son is eternally begotten of the Father, the Spirit proceeds (the Church later debated the phrase filioque — “from the Son” — but orthodox Trinitarianism affirms eternal relations without making one person inferior).\n\nHow can “one” be “three”? — coherence without contradiction\n- The doctrine avoids contradiction by distinguishing two questions:\n  1. What is God? (one divine essence)\n  2. Who is God? (three persons)\n- A statement such as “God is one” answers the first; “God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit” answers the second. These statements are not logically inconsistent because they refer to different aspects of divinity (essence vs. personhood).\n- Each person is fully and wholly God (not a part of God). The Son is not one-third of God; the Spirit is not one-third. Each person possesses the single divine essence without division (this is the classical claim of “each person has the whole deity”).\n\nDistinctions within unity\n- The persons are distinguished relationally and by origin, not by essence or power. The Father is not the Son; the Son is not the Spirit; the Spirit is not the Father. Yet they share the same divine attributes (omnipotence, omniscience, eternality, etc.) and act inseparably in creation, providence, and redemption (e.g., Father sends the Son; Son obeys Father and accomplishes redemption; Spirit applies redemption).\n\nWhat the doctrine is not (common heresies)\n- Modalism (Sabellianism): the claim that Father, Son, and Spirit are merely three modes or roles of one person. Orthodox Trinitarianism rejects this because Scripture shows distinct, simultaneous interpersonal relations (e.g., Jesus praying to the Father; the Spirit speaking).\n- Arianism: the denial of the Son’s full deity (claiming the Son is a created being). Orthodoxy affirms the Son is uncreated, eternal, and consubstantial with the Father.\n- Tritheism: the claim that there are three gods. Orthodoxy holds strictly to one divine essence.\n\nAnalogies—and their limits\n- Helpful analogies (with caution): one substance in three relations (mind with memory, intellect, will; or sun with light and heat). These can illustrate aspects of the doctrine but always fail to capture the divine mystery fully and often risk error (modalism or partialism) if pressed too far.\n- The right posture: analogies can point out the possibility of unity with relational distinction but must be used humbly and critically.\n\nHistorical grounding\n- Early church defended Trinitarian doctrine against Arius and others; key formulations found in the Nicene Creed (325, expanded 381) and later in the Athanasian Creed. These creeds articulate one God in three co-equal, co-eternal Persons.\n\nPractical and pastoral significance\n- Worship: Christians worship one God who is Father, Son, and Spirit (Matthew 28:19; John 4:23–24).\n- Salvation: the Father plans, the Son accomplishes (incarnation, atonement, resurrection), and the Spirit applies and sustains salvation in believers (Ephesians 1–2; John 14–16; Romans 8).\n- Prayer and Christian life: prayer is to the Father, in the name of the Son, by the power of the Spirit—our knowledge of God’s love and fellowship is shaped by the triune life revealed in Scripture (2 Corinthians 13:14).\n\nMystery without contradiction\n- The Trinity is presented in Scripture and formulated by the church as both knowable and ultimately mysterious. It is not irrational: it is a coherent doctrine answering biblical revelation about God’s oneness and God’s tri-personal life. But because God is infinite and we are finite, the Trinity remains a divine mystery—we can know truly who God is without exhausting God’s being.\n\nOne-sentence summary\n- The Trinity teaches that the one God is eternally three personal, co-equal, co-eternal Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who share one divine essence and who act together in creation, redemption, and sanctification.",

          "rationale": "The response accurately presents the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity: one God in three co-eternal, co-equal Persons (Father, Son, Spirit) sharing one divine essence (ousia), with distinct personal subsistences (hypostases). It correctly notes homoousios from Nicaea, the eternal relations (Father unoriginated, Son eternally begotten, Spirit proceeds), and the doctrinal distinction between essence and person. It safeguards against common heresies (modalism, Arianism, Tritheism) and uses key biblical data from both Testaments (e.g., Gen 1:26; Ps 110:1; John 1:1–3; Col 2:9; John 14–16; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14). It acknowledges the mystery of the Trinity and the inseparability of the divine actions in creation, redemption, and sanctification, while also giving pastoral implications (worship, prayer, salvation). Nuances are captured (historical developments, filioque brief mention, caveats about analogies, perichoresis). A minor point worth expanding in some contexts is the precise treatment of the filioque debate (Eastern vs Western formulations) and additional nuances like perichoresis, but these do not undermine overall accuracy."

It correctly notes historical formulation (Nicene, Athanasian) and common pastoral implications. A minor caveat is the brief nod to the filioque controversy; Eastern tradition often emphasizes the Father as the source without asserting the Son as a second source, while Western usage includes filioque in some traditions.
