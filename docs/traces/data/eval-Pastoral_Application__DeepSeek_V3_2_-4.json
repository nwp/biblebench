    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "My friend, thank you for entrusting me with this burden. I hear the weight in your question—not only the struggle with depression itself, but the added pain of feeling judged by fellow believers. Please know first that you are seen, you are heard, and your suffering matters deeply to God.\n\nLet me speak clearly: **You are not failing spiritually.** The idea that taking medication for depression is a sign of weak faith or a failure to trust God is a harmful misunderstanding, and it does not reflect the full counsel of Scripture.\n\nLet us ground our response in truth:\n\n1.  **The Bible honors both spiritual and physical means of healing.** God is the healer of all our afflictions (Psalm 103:2-3), and He provides wisdom for healing through various means. We see this when Isaiah used a fig poultice on King Hezekiah’s boil (2 Kings 20:7), when Paul advised Timothy to use a little wine for his stomach ailments (1 Timothy 5:23), and when the Good Samaritan used oil and wine to treat wounds (Luke 10:34). Medication for a medical condition, including depression which often involves a physiological component, is a gift of God’s common grace, a tool of wisdom, not a rival to faith. To use it is an act of stewardship over the body God gave you.\n\n2.  **Depression is not simply a \"spiritual\" problem.** While our spiritual state can affect our emotions, and sin can bring grief, the Bible portrays humans as integrated beings—body, mind, and spirit. The Psalms are filled with raw expressions of deep despair (see Psalm 42:5, 11; Psalm 88). The prophet Elijah, after great spiritual victory, fell into a state of exhaustion and despondency, pleading for God to take his life (1 Kings 19:4). God’s response was not a rebuke for lack of faith, but tender care: He provided sleep, food, water, and the presence of a companion. God attended to his physical and emotional needs.\n\n3.  **Faith and medicine are not opposites; they can be allies.** Taking medication can be an act of faith, a way of saying, \"God, I trust you for healing, and I will use the wise means you have provided in this world.\" It can clear the fog so you can engage more fully in prayer, Scripture, and community. To imply you must choose between medicine and faith creates a false dichotomy that burdens already weary souls.\n\nHere is my pastoral counsel:\n\n*   **Reject the false guilt.** You are not \"cheating\" or taking a shortcut. You are caring for your body, which is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Thank God for the medical help that allows you to function and seek Him.\n*   **Seek compassionate community.** Surround yourself with believers who understand the “ministry of presence” (Job 2:13), who weep with those who weep (Romans 12:15), and who bear burdens without simplistic answers (Galatians 6:2). You may need to gently but firmly set boundaries with those who speak from ignorance rather than compassion.\n*   **Continue to seek God in the valley.** Depression can make prayer and Bible reading feel impossible. That’s okay. God meets us in our weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9). A simple cry of “Help me, Lord” is a profound prayer. Listen to Scripture being read. Remember that the Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit (Psalm 34:18).\n*   **Practice holistic stewardship.** Alongside your medication, with your doctor’s guidance, consider other aspects of health: gentle physical activity, nutrition, sunlight, rest, and faithful Christian counseling. Your soul, mind, and body are connected.\n\nFinally, remember the character of our Savior. Jesus was “a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief” (Isaiah 53:3). He does not stand aloof from your pain; He enters into it. He does not scorn your struggle; He offers you His yoke, which is easy, and His burden, which is light (Matthew 11:28-30).\n\nYou are not failing. You are fighting a hard battle, and you are doing so with courage. The very fact that you are asking this question shows a heart that desires to honor God. Walk forward in the freedom that Christ offers, using every good gift He provides—including medicine—to steward your life for His glory. You are loved, you are not alone, and your hope is secure in Him, even on the darkest days.\n\nI am here to walk with you. Let us hold fast to the promise that “night will not last forever; joy comes with the morning” (Psalm 30:5, paraphrased).",

          "rationale": "The response accurately affirms that depression can involve medical factors and that seeking treatment (including medication) does not indicate weak faith or guilt before God. It treats body, mind, and spirit as integrated, aligns with biblical examples of using permissible means for healing (fig poultice in 2 Kings 20:7, oil/wine in Luke 10:34, Paul advising Timothy in 1 Timothy 5:23), and emphasizes that faith and medicine can work together. It correctly cites biblical maintaining themes: God’s care for the despondent (Elijah, Psalms), the sufficiency of Christ, and the value of spiritual practices alongside medical care. It also offers pastoral counsel consistent with orthodoxy (careful community,Scripture, and counseling; 1 Cor 6:19-20 on the body as God’s temple; 2 Cor 12:9; Ps 34:18; Matt 11:28-30). Nuance is preserved by acknowledging the complexity of depression, the dangers of shaming, and the importance of compassionate, non-judgmental support. A minor caveat is that some springboards (e.g., using 1 Tim 5:23 to generalize about all medications) are interpretive rather than explicit mandates, but they are commonly acceptable within orthodox Christian ethics and do not undermine the overall doctrinal integrity."

It avoids demonizing medicine or labeling depression as a uniquely spiritual failure, and it affirms God’s care and presence in weakness (2 Cor 12:9; Isa 53:3). Practically, it offers actionable, well-rounded guidance: medical supervision, therapy, lifestyle factors, and spiritual disciplines. However, it does not explicitly address crisis safety planning or provide concrete crisis resources, which is an important component of pastoral mental-health care. Overall, the balance of truth and grace is strong, and the guidance is pastorally and theologically responsible with room for a brief improvement in safety protocols and more concrete, time-bound next steps."
