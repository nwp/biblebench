    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "**Short answer:**  \nThe statement *“As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become”* is a central teaching of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‑day Saints (LDS).  It expresses the LDS doctrine of **eternal progression**—the idea that God the Father was once a mortal being who attained divinity, and that faithful humans can, in the future, become like God.  This formulation **does not accord with historic (orthodox) Christian theology** as articulated in the early ecumenical creeds, the writings of the Church Fathers, and the theological consensus of the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestant traditions.  \n\nBelow is a balanced, respectful examination of why the LDS view diverges from orthodox Christianity, where the two traditions overlap, and the theological implications of the difference.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the LDS Teaching Means\n\n| LDS source | Key idea expressed |\n|------------|--------------------|\n| **Doctrine and Covenants 132:20** (c. 1843) | “He who is ordained a high priest … shall be the **father of a multitude of sons and daughters**, and shall **reign over them in the kingdoms of God**.” |\n| **Pearl of Great Price, Abraham 3:22‑26** (Joseph Smith translation) | God the Father is described as “the **father of many**… **once a man** … who progressed to become a God.” |\n| **Teachings of early LDS leaders (e.g., Brigham Young, Orson Pratt)** | Frequently quoted: “As man now is, **God once was**; as God now is, **man may become**.” |\n\nThe doctrine is often called **“theosis”** within LDS literature, but it is crucial to note that LDS “theosis” is radically different from the Eastern‑Orthodox concept of theosis (see §4).\n\n**Key doctrinal points**\n\n1. **God the Father had a mortal origin** – He was once an exalted man who progressed to deity.\n2. **Divinity is attainable** – Faithful members, through obedience to ordinances and covenants, can become “gods” and “god‑like” in the afterlife, capable of creating worlds and having spirit children.\n3. **Progression is ongoing** – Both God and humanity are seen as being in a dynamic state of “progression” rather than a static, immutable condition.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Tenets of Orthodox (Historic) Christian Theology\n\n### a. The Nature of God\n\n| Orthodoxy (Creeds, Church Fathers) | Statement |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|\n| **Nicene‑Constantinopolitan Creed (381 AD)** | “We believe in one God, **the Father Almighty**, **uncreated**, **eternal**, **invisible**, **all‑powerful**, **who is not made**.” |\n| **Athanasius (4th c.)** | “God is **uncaused**, **without beginning**, **uncreated**, **immutable**.” |\n| **Augustine (5th c.)** | “God is **unchanging** (immutabilis), **eternal**, **simple** (without parts).” |\n| **Council of Chalcedon (451 AD)** | Affirms the **full divinity** and **full humanity** of the Son, but not that the divine nature is capable of change or becoming. |\n\n**Key points**\n\n- God is **eternally God**. He did **not** “become” God; He **always** has been God.\n- God is **immut­able** (unchanging) in nature, will, and perfections.\n- God's **being is simple**: no composition of parts or transitional stages.\n\n### b. Anthropology (Human Nature)\n\n| Orthodoxy | Statement |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| **Genesis 1‑2** | Humanity is **created** (creatio ex nihilo) by God as **finite** “image‑bearers” (imago Dei). |\n| **St. Paul (1 Cor 15:44‑49)** | “We shall be **raised incorruptible**, **glorified**, but **not become** God. “He that is **last** shall be **first**, but **no one** becomes “the Father.” |\n| **Eastern‑Orthodox Theosis** (e.g., St. Gregory Palamas) | Humans may **participate** in God’s *energies* (grace), **sharing** in divine life, **but never becoming** the **essence** of God. |\n\n**Key points**\n\n- Humans are **creatures**, not **co‑eternal** with God.\n- While “theosis” (participation in divine life) is a biblical and patristic theme, it **does not imply ontological transformation into God**; it speaks of *union* with God by grace, not *becoming* God in the sense of acquiring divinity as a nature.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Where the Two Traditions Diverge\n\n| Issue | LDS Teaching | Orthodox Christian Teaching |\n|-------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **God’s origin** | God the Father **was once a mortal man**; He progressed to deity. | God **has no origin**; He is **uncreated** and **eternally** God (no “before”). |\n| **Nature of divine progression** | Both God and humanity are in **continual progression**; **future exaltation** of humans into god‑hood is a doctrinal goal. | God is **immutable**; humanity can be **transformed** (sanctified) but **cannot become** God’s essence. |\n| **Possibility of humans becoming gods** | **Yes** – “man may become” a god with the power to create, have spirit offspring, etc. | **No** – Humans may become *children of God* (adopted) and share in *divine life*, but they **remain creatures**. |\n| **Scriptural basis** | Uses **Pearl of Great Price**, **Doctrine & Covenants**, **Joseph Smith’s revelations**—texts outside the biblical canon recognized by historic Christianity. | Relies on the **Bible alone** (canon recognized by the early ecumenical councils) and the **Patristic tradition**. |\n| **Eschatology** | After resurrection, believers **inherit** and **exercise** divine authority; “exaltation” includes creating worlds. | The **New Creation** (cf. Revelation 21‑22) is the **final state** for believers, but they do not become *new gods*; they enjoy **eternal communion** with the singular God. |\n\nBecause the LDS claim that “God once was” fundamentally overturns the doctrine of God’s **eternity and uncreated nature**, it is **incompatible** with the core articles of faith affirmed in the **Nicene Creed, the Athanasian Creed, and the Catechism of the Catholic Church**, as well as with the theological consensus of the Eastern Orthodox and historic Protestant traditions.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The “Theosis” of Orthodox Christianity – A Clarifying Comparison\n\nMany readers initially think the LDS doctrine echoes the Eastern‑Orthodox concept of **theosis**.  The similarity is only superficial; the two notions differ on crucial points.\n\n| Aspect | LDS “theosis” (exaltation) | Orthodox “theosis” |\n|--------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Goal** | Become a *god* with an independent divine nature; **create** and **govern** worlds. | **Participate** in God’s divine life (grace) while remaining a *creature*. |\n| **Mechanism** | Ordinances, temple work, covenants sealing a *future* ontological change. | Sanctifying grace, sacramental life, the Holy Spirit’s indwelling. |\n| **Nature of change** | Ontological *upgrade*: a new nature added to the person. | No change in *essence*; believers are “made **conformable** to the image of Christ” (2 Cor 3:18) **without** becoming God in essence. |\n| **Scriptural grounding** | Relies on non‑canonical LDS revelations (e.g., Abraham 3). | Grounded in Scripture (e.g., 2 Peter 1:4, John 17:21) and the Patristic tradition. |\n| **Final state** | “God‑like beings” **co‑equal** with the Father in power. | Eternal communion with the **one** God; believers remain **children** of God (John 1:12). |\n\nThus, while the term “theosis” appears in both traditions, the **orthodox Christian** understanding retains a strict **ontological distinction** between Creator and creature, whereas the LDS view *blurs* that distinction by allowing creatures to become *co‑gods*.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Areas of Overlap (Where the Two Traditions Agree)\n\nFor fairness, it is worth noting the doctrines they **share**, even though the underlying metaphysics differ.\n\n| Shared belief | Explanation |\n|--------------|-------------|\n| **Christ as Savior** | Both affirm that **Jesus Christ** atoned for sin and that faith in Him is essential for salvation. |\n| **Post‑mortem continuation** | Both teach that life does not end at death; there is an **afterlife** where individuals are judged. |\n| **Moral agency** | Both emphasize **free will** and personal responsibility. |\n| **Biblical narrative** | Both accept the **biblical narrative of creation, fall, redemption, and consummation** (though LDS scripture adds additional revelations). |\n| **Eternal families** | LDS emphasizes “eternal families” (sealings), while many Christian traditions stress the **family of God** (the Church as “the body of Christ”). |\n\nThese points of agreement are **not sufficient** to bring the LDS view of divine progression within the boundaries of **orthodox Christian orthodoxy**; the **defining doctrines of the nature of God** and **the possibility of humans becoming gods** remain fundamentally opposed.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Why the Difference Matters Theologically\n\n1. **Christology** – If God was once a mortal man, the uniqueness of the Incarnation (the second person of the Trinity becoming truly human) is re‑interpreted. In LDS theology, the Son of God is also a “created” being, distinct from the Father’s previous mortal condition. In historic Christianity, the Son is **co‑eternal** and **consubstantial** with the Father (the doctrine of the *homoousios* of Nicene Creed).\n\n2. **Soteriology** – LDS “exaltation” requires **additional ordinances** (e.g., temple sealing, celestial marriage) to achieve godhood. In orthodox Christianity, **justification and sanctification** are fully accomplished by **Christ’s atoning work**; there is no further “progression” into divine status.\n\n3. **Eschatology** – LDS eschatology includes a **multiplicity of worlds** presided over by exalted beings. Orthodox eschatology points to **the new heaven and new earth** where **God alone remains God**, and humanity enjoys **communion** without becoming creators.\n\n4. **Ecclesiology** – The LDS view of priesthood authority as a **restoration** of ancient priesthood lines (including a claim that current apostles share the same “authority” as ancient prophets) is not recognized by historic Christian churches, which see **apostolic succession** (in the Catholic and Orthodox sense) as rooted in the **unbroken line from the apostles** without the need for a *restoration* from a priesthood that was once mortal.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Conclusion\n\n- The LDS axiom **“As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become”** encapsulates a **doctrine of eternal progression** that **asserts God’s prior mortality** and **human potential to become divine**.\n- **Orthodox Christian theology**, as defined by the early ecumenical creeds and the consistent teaching of the Catholic, Eastern‑Orthodox, and historic Protestant traditions, **holds that God is eternally uncreated, immutable, and wholly other**; **humans remain created beings**, capable of participating in God’s life but **never becoming God in essence**.\n- Consequently, **the LDS teaching is not consistent with orthodox Christian theology**. It represents a **significant doctrinal departure** concerning the nature of God, the status of humanity, and the ultimate purpose of salvation.\n- Nevertheless, it is possible to recognize **shared devotional elements** (belief in Christ, moral agency, afterlife) while maintaining clear theological boundaries.\n\nIn respectful dialogue, one can acknowledge the LDS tradition’s sincere conviction that God is a loving Father who once progressed, while also clearly stating that **historic Christianity does not affirm that God “once was” a man nor that humans can become gods in the sense the LDS doctrine proposes**. This distinction is a core point of theological disagreement between the two faiths.",

          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the response faithfully communicates the orthodox critique of the LDS axiom 'As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become' by contrasting divine immutability, eternality, and Creator/creature distinction with the LDS view of eternal progression and potential deification. It correctly highlights key doctrinal differences (God’s uncreated eternity vs. divine exaltation of humans, immutability vs. progression, and the nature of salvation) and offers a nuanced comparison with the Eastern Orthodox understanding of theosis (participation by grace without ontological change). The LLM also notes areas of overlap (Christology as Savior, afterlife, moral agency) with appropriate cautions. However, a factual error appears in the discussion of Orthodox scriptural basis, where it characterizes Orthodoxy as relying on “Bible alone,” which is inaccurate because Orthodox theology holds to Scripture plus Sacred Tradition as authoritative. This misstatement, while isolated, affects the precision of the biblical-grounding portion. The rest of the analysis is solid and well-argued, with a careful balance between fidelity to biblical/doctrinal norms and respectful engagement with LDS beliefs."
