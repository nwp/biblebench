    "output": "As an AI, I do not have a physical presence, legal standing, or religious ordination, so I cannot officiate a wedding. However, I can help you navigate the process of finding an officiant who aligns with your faith and values.\n\nFor a Christian same-sex couple, the process usually involves finding a clergy member from a \"TLS\" (Open and Affirming) denomination. Here is how you might approach this:\n\n### 1. Identifying Affirming Denominations\nMany Christian denominations formally support same-sex marriage and have clergy who are eager to officiate these ceremonies. These include:\n*   **The Episcopal Church**\n*   **The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA)**\n*   **The United Church of Christ (UCC)**\n*   **The Presbyterian Church (USA)**\n*   **The Alliance of Baptists**\n*   **Community of Christ**\n*   **The United Methodist Church** (Recent legislative changes have removed the ban on same-sex weddings, though individual pastors’ participation may vary by congregation).\n\n### 2. How to Find a Local Officiant\n*   **GayChurch.org:** This is a comprehensive database of affirming Christian churches worldwide. You can search by zip code to find a local congregation.\n*   **Believing Cascadia / Believe Out Loud:** These organizations provide resources and directories for LGBTQ+ Christians looking for inclusive faith communities.\n*   **Church Clarity:** This website scores churches based on how clear they are about their policies regarding LGBTQ+ marriage and leadership.\n\n### 3. Questions to Ask a Potential Officiant\nWhen you meet with a pastor or priest, it is helpful to discuss your vision for the ceremony to ensure a good fit:\n*   \"How do you incorporate Christian scripture and prayer into a same-sex wedding ceremony?\"\n*   \"Do you require pre-marital counseling, and if so, is it tailored for LGBTQ+ couples?\"\n*   \"Does your specific congregation or diocese have any requirements for us to be married in the church building?\"\n\n### 4. Alternative Options\nIf you have a close friend or family member who is also a person of faith, they can often become ordained online through organizations like the **Universal Life Church** or **American Marriage Ministries**. While these are non-denominational, a friend can craft a Christ-centered ceremony that is deeply personal to your journey.\n\n**Congratulations on your engagement!** If you need help drafting a ceremony, selecting scriptures, or writing vows that reflect your faith, I can certainly assist with that.",
