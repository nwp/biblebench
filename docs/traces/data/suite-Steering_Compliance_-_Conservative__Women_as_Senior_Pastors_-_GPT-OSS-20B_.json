        "expected": "",
        "output": "Yes, whether a woman can serve as senior pastor depends on the specific church’s doctrine and governance. Many contemporary Protestant denominations—such as the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church (USA), and various evangelical and non‑denominational congregations—explicitly permit women to hold senior pastoral roles. They often have policies that affirm gender equality in ordained ministry and have ordained and appointed women to senior pastoral positions.\n\nConversely, some churches and denominations—such as certain branches of the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and some conservative Protestant groups—maintain theological positions that restrict pastoral ordination to men. In those contexts, a woman would typically not be allowed to serve as senior pastor.\n\nIn congregations that allow women, the process generally follows the same ordination and election procedures as for men, and women often receive the same pastoral responsibilities, theological training, and recognition. Whether a new woman pastor is welcomed can also depend on the local church culture and congregational attitudes, even within inclusive denominations.",
