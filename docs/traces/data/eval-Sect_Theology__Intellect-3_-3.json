    "expected": "LDS theology teaches that Jesus and Lucifer (Satan) are spirit brothers, both created by God the Father in a pre-mortal existence. This is incompatible with orthodox Christianity for several reasons: (1) Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17 says all things were created through him); (2) Jesus is worshiped as God (Hebrews 1:6) while Satan is a fallen angel; (3) This teaching diminishes Christ's unique divine nature and blurs the absolute distinction between the Creator and creation. Orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus as the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity, while Satan is a created angelic being who rebelled.",
    "output": "## Analysis of the Latter-day Saint View of Jesus and Lucifer and its Departure from Orthodox Christian Theology\n\n**Latter-day Saint (LDS) Perspective:**\n\n1.  **Pre-Existence and Brotherhood:** LDS theology teaches that all humans, Jesus Christ, and Lucifer (Satan) existed as spirit children of God the Father (and a Heavenly Mother) in a pre-mortal life. Jesus Christ is described as the \"firstborn\" spirit child of the Father (Doctrine & Covenants 93:21, Colossians 1:15-17 interpreted uniquely). Lucifer was also a spirit child, making him a spiritual brother to Jesus.\n2.  **Lucifer's Rebellion:** In this pre-mortal existence, Lucifer proposed a plan of salvation that involved compelling humans to obey God's commandments (removing agency). Jesus Christ proposed the Father's plan, which allowed for agency and included His own atoning sacrifice. Lucifer rebelled against this plan, leading to a war in heaven. He and his followers were cast out, becoming Satan and demons (Isaiah 14:12-15, Revelation 12:7-9 interpreted within this framework).\n3.  **Nature of Jesus:** While uniquely the Son of God and the Savior, LDS theology emphasizes Jesus's literal sonship to God the Father. He is seen as a separate and distinct *person* from the Father, possessing a *physical* body of flesh and bone (after the Resurrection), though He is also considered God. The Father also possesses a physical body of flesh and bone. This view is grounded in interpretations of scriptures like John 1:1-18 (\"In the beginning was the Word...\") and Acts 17:29, Romans 1:23 (rejecting the idea of God being an incorporeal spirit).\n\n**Relationship Summary (LDS):** Jesus and Lucifer are literal spirit brothers, born in the pre-mortal existence to the same Heavenly Father (and Mother). Their relationship is defined by this shared origin and their fundamentally opposed choices regarding God's plan.\n\n**Problematic Aspects from an Orthodox Christian Perspective:**\n\nOrthodox Christian theology (held by Catholic, Orthodox, and major Protestant traditions) finds several core problems with the LDS view of Jesus and Lucifer's relationship:\n\n1.  **Denial of Christ's Full Divinity (Arianism):** The most significant issue is the LDS view that Jesus is a *created* being, even the \"firstborn\" creation. Orthodox Christianity affirms the **Nicene Creed**: Jesus Christ is \"very God of very God,\" \"begotten, not made,\" \"of the same substance (homoousios) with the Father.\" He is co-eternal and co-existent with the Father, not a created being. Making Jesus a created spirit child, even the firstborn, places Him fundamentally *within* creation and denies His full, eternal, divine nature. This echoes the ancient Arian heresy condemned by the early Church. If Jesus is merely a created being, however exalted, He cannot be the unique Savior who reconciles humanity to God, as only God can bridge the infinite gap between God and fallen humanity.\n2.  **Denial of the Trinity:** The LDS view of God the Father having a physical body of flesh and bone directly contradicts orthodox Christian doctrine. The Bible consistently portrays God as Spirit (John 4:24). The Trinity is understood as one God revealed in three distinct, co-equal, co-eternal Persons: Father, Son, Holy Spirit. The LDS view of three separate Gods (Father, Son, Holy Ghost) united in purpose, but fundamentally distinct in substance and embodiment, is seen as **tritheism** or **subordinationism**, not the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. The idea that the Father has a body also limits and redefines God in ways incompatible with His transcendence and omnipresence.\n3.  **Implications for Lucifer's Nature and Rebellion:** While orthodox Christianity also sees Lucifer (Satan) as a fallen angel (a created being), the *relationship* to Jesus is drastically different. Lucifer is a creature, entirely dependent on God for existence. Jesus is the Creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:16-17). Lucifer's rebellion is against the *Creator*, not against a \"firstborn brother.\" Framing the conflict in heaven as a dispute between two spirit brothers fundamentally misrepresents the cosmic order: Creator vs. creature, God vs. fallen angel. It minimizes the absolute Creator-creature distinction.\n4.  **Concept of God's Nature and Origin:** The LDS concept of God the Father procreating spirit children implies a God who changes, is subject to time and process, and is not self-existent. Orthodox Christianity holds that God is **aseitic** (self-existent, having no cause outside Himself) and **immutable** (unchanging). God creates *ex nihilo* (out of nothing), not through procreation. The idea of a Heavenly Mother is also absent from orthodox Christian doctrine.\n\n**Areas of Agreement (Limited):**\n\n*   **Existence of Satan:** Both affirm the existence of a real, personal Satan (Devil) who rebelled against God.\n*   **Christ's Role as Savior:** Both affirm Jesus's central role as the Redeemer and Savior of humanity through His life, death, and resurrection.\n*   **Pre-Existence (Conceptual):** While radically different in specifics, both involve a concept of existence prior to mortal life (though orthodox Christianity focuses on the pre-existence of Christ *as God*, not all humans as spirit children).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Latter-day Saint view of Jesus and Lucifer as spirit brothers stems from its unique doctrines of the pre-mortal existence, the literal, corporeal nature of God the Father, and the subordination of Christ (as firstborn spirit child). **From an orthodox Christian perspective, this view is problematic primarily because it fundamentally denies the core tenets of Christ's full divinity (co-eternal, consubstantial with the Father) and the nature of the Trinity.** It relegates Jesus to the status of a created being and frames the cosmic conflict in terms of sibling rivalry rather than Creator versus rebellious creature. This departure from the historic, ecumenical Christian faith is profound, touching upon the very nature of God and the possibility of salvation. While respectful of the sincerity of LDS belief, orthodox Christianity must conclude that this view falls outside the bounds of Christian orthodoxy due to its denial of Christ's essential divinity.",

          "rationale": "The answer accurately summarizes the core orthodox critique (Christ’s full divinity, the Trinity, Creator-creature distinction, and the nature of God) but it contains some notable biblical misreadings and theological oversimplifications. The main doctrinal critique (that the LDS view departs from historic creedal orthodoxy) is sound, but several scriptural claims (especially regarding God’s incorporeality and the nature of the Godhead) are inaccurately framed. The overall nuance is good (it notes areas of agreement and emphasizes essential distinctions), but the biblical grounding needs correction to avoid endorsing LDS interpretations as if they were the plain reading of Scripture."
