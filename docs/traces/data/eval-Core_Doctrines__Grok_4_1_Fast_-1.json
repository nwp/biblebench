    "expected": "The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is one person with two complete and distinct natures: fully God and fully human. These two natures are united without mixture, confusion, separation, or division. Jesus is not partly God and partly human, but wholly God and wholly human simultaneously.",
    "output": "### The Hypostatic Union: Jesus Christ as One Person in Two Natures\n\nThe **hypostatic union** is a central doctrine of Christian theology describing the unique person of Jesus Christ. The term \"hypostatic\" derives from the Greek *hypostasis*, meaning \"person\" or \"subsistent reality.\" It affirms that Jesus Christ is **one divine-human person** (*hypostasis*) who eternally exists in **two distinct natures**: fully divine and fully human. These natures are united in His single person without confusion, change, division, or separation. This union is not a mixture or blending (as in some heresies like Eutychianism) but a real, personal subsistence where each nature retains its full integrity while acting inseparably in the one Christ.\n\nThis doctrine preserves the mystery of the Incarnation—God becoming man in Jesus—essential for understanding salvation, as only a God-man could atone for humanity's infinite sin while perfectly representing us (Hebrews 2:17).\n\n#### Biblical Foundation\nScripture does not use the term \"hypostatic union,\" but it clearly teaches both the full deity and full humanity of Christ, united in one person. Key passages include:\n\n1. **Christ's Full Deity**:\n   - John 1:1, 14: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.\" The eternal divine Word (Logos) assumes humanity without ceasing to be God.\n   - Colossians 2:9: \"For in him [Christ] the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.\" Christ's body houses the complete divine essence.\n   - Philippians 2:6–7: Christ, \"who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.\" His \"emptying\" (*kenosis*) involves adding humanity, not subtracting deity.\n   - John 10:30: \"I and the Father are one\" (affirming divine unity, cf. John 20:28, where Thomas calls Jesus \"My Lord and my God\").\n\n2. **Christ's Full Humanity**:\n   - Hebrews 2:14, 17: \"Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things... Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect.\" Christ fully shares human nature to be a merciful high priest.\n   - Luke 2:52: Jesus \"increased in wisdom and in stature.\" He experienced genuine human growth and limitation.\n   - John 4:6: Jesus was \"wearied... from his journey,\" showing physical human fatigue.\n   - 1 Timothy 2:5: \"There is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,\" emphasizing His humanity alongside deity (cf. Romans 1:3).\n\n3. **Union in One Person**:\n   - Verses attribute divine and human actions to the *same subject* (Christ): He forgives sins (Mark 2:5–7, divine prerogative), yet hungers (Matthew 4:2), sleeps (Mark 4:38), and dies (John 19:30).\n   - Matthew 16:16: Peter confesses \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God\"—one person as Messiah (human role) and divine Son.\n\nThese realities are not two separate persons (as Nestorianism erred) but one *hypostasis* (person) with two natures.\n\n#### The Chalcedonian Definition (AD 451)\nTo safeguard biblical truth against heresies, the Council of Chalcedon articulated the hypostatic union in its famous definition:\n> \"We confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ... perfect in Godhead and also perfect in manhood; truly God and truly man... consubstantial with the Father according to the Godhead, and consubstantial with us according to the Manhood... in two natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably; the distinction of natures being in no way annulled by the union, but rather the characteristics of each nature being preserved.\"\n\n- **Unconfused**: Deity and humanity remain distinct (no hybrid nature).\n- **Unchangeably**: Neither nature is altered.\n- **Indivisibly/Inseparably**: The natures cannot be split; all actions are of the one person.\n\nThis echoes earlier councils like Nicaea (325, Christ's deity) and Constantinople (381, Holy Spirit), forming Nicene orthodoxy.\n\n#### Theological Significance\nThe hypostatic union is foundational:\n- **Soteriology**: Christ's deity provides infinite atonement (1 John 2:2); His humanity allows substitutionary death for us (Hebrews 2:9).\n- **Worship**: We worship one God-man without idolatry (Philippians 2:9–11).\n- **Christian Life**: Christ sympathizes as God-with-us (Hebrews 4:15–16).\n\nDenials lead to error: Arianism (Christ not fully God), Apollinarianism (no full human soul), or modern reductions (e.g., Jesus as \"merely\" a moral teacher). The hypostatic union upholds the Bible's portrait of the incarnate Son, inviting faith in Him as Savior (John 14:6). For deeper study, see Athanasius's *On the Incarnation* or the Heidelberg Catechism (Q&A 17–18).",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately defines the hypostatic union as one person with two complete natures (fully God and fully human) united without mixture, preserving both natures in one hypostasis. It correctly distinguishes orthodox teaching from Nestorianism, cites the Chalcedonian formulation (unconfused, unchangeable, indivisible, inseparable), and grounds claims in Scripture (John 1:1,14; Colossians 2:9; Philippians 2:6–7; John 10:30; Hebrews 2:14,17; Luke 2:52; John 4:6; 1 Timothy 2:5; plus examples of Christ’s divine and human actions). It notes the Incarnation’s significance for salvation and worship, and it cautions against heresies (Arianism, Apollinarianism). The treatment is solidly orthodox and biblically informed. A minor nuance is the brief handling of kenosis (Philippians 2:7): while many orthodox expositors affirm that the divine nature remains intact and humanity is added in the incarnate person, interpretations of kenosis vary; this is a debated point rather than a doctrinal error in the overall presentation."

          "explanation": "The response presents a robust, historically orthodox account of the hypostatic union: Jesus is one person (hypostasis) with two natures, fully God and fully man, united without confusion or separation. It correctly cites Chalcedon (AD 451) and affirms that the two natures remain distinct while acting inseparably in the one person. It explicitly rejects Nestorianism (two separate persons) and Eutychian/Monophysite concerns (fusion of natures). It cites key biblical passages and links to soteriology, worship, and pastoral relevance, which aligns with classical Christology. A minor area for nuance is the discussion of kenosis in Philippians 2:6–7: the claim that kenosis involves “adding humanity, not subtracting deity” reflects one common orthodox reading, but many theologians understand kenosis as the self-emptying of some divine prerogatives rather than an elimination of deity itself. This could be clarified to avoid potential misinterpretation that Christ surrendered essential divine attributes. Overall, there are no doctrinal errors or unorthodox conclusions in the provided text; the remaining notes reinforce historical orthodoxy and suggest further classical sources for study."
