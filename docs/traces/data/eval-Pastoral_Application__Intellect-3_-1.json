    "input": "A person struggling with same-sex attraction asks: 'Can I be a Christian and experience these feelings? Does God hate me?'",
    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "My dear child of God, thank you for your courage in bringing these deep struggles into the light. Let's sit together and gently seek wisdom from Scripture, for it is the firm foundation for our lives. Your feelings are real, and your questions are weighty. Let me address them with both the truth of God's Word and the boundless compassion of Christ.\n\n**1. God's Love for You is Unconditional and Unchanging:**\n*   **Scripture:** \"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\" (Romans 5:8) \"I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing kindness.\" (Jeremiah 31:3) \"See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! That is what we are!\" (1 John 3:1)\n*   **Truth:** Your feelings, no matter how intense or confusing, do not change God's love for you. He knew you, He knew your heart, and He knew your struggles before you were formed in the womb (Psalm 139:13-16). He pursued you while you were still in rebellion. **God does NOT hate you.** He hates sin because it separates us from Him, but He loves the sinner – and that includes you – with a fierce, sacrificial love demonstrated on the cross. Your same-sex attraction is a part of the brokenness we all inherit in a fallen world; it does not place you outside the reach of God's grace or make you less His cherished child.\n\n**2. Your Identity is Found in Christ, Not Your Feelings:**\n*   **Scripture:** \"So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith... There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" (Galatians 3:26-28) \"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!\" (2 Corinthians 5:17)\n*   **Truth:** Your primary identity is not \"gay\" or \"struggling with same-sex attraction.\" Your primary, eternal identity is \"child of God,\" \"beloved of Christ,\" \"saint\" (holy one), \"new creation.\" While your feelings are real and significant, they are not the totality of who you are. Your worth and value are anchored firmly in God's love and your redeemed identity in Christ. Your feelings are a part of your human experience, but they do not define your core being before God.\n\n**3. Experiencing the Feeling vs. Acting on the Feeling:**\n*   **Scripture:** \"But each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.\" (James 1:14-15) \"Flee from sexual immorality... Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?\" (1 Corinthians 6:18-19)\n*   **Truth:** God created sexuality as a good gift within the boundaries of marriage between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24). Acting on same-sex attraction outside of this God-ordained boundary is sexual immorality, which is sin and grieves God's Spirit within you. **Experiencing the attraction itself is not sin.** Temptation is not sin. We all experience temptations (1 Corinthians 10:13). The struggle arises when we choose to act on those feelings in ways contrary to God's design. The call to holiness applies to *all* believers, regardless of their specific temptations (1 Peter 1:13-16). Your journey involves learning to manage these feelings in ways that honor God.\n\n**4. God's Grace is Sufficient and Provides a Way Forward:**\n*   **Scripture:** \"No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.\" (1 Corinthians 10:13) \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\" (2 Corinthians 12:9)\n*   **Truth:** God understands your struggle intimately (Hebrews 4:15). He promises never to allow a temptation that is beyond your capacity to resist *with His help*. He always provides a \"way out\" – a path to endure and overcome. This path may involve:\n    *   **Deepening your relationship with Christ:** Through prayer, Scripture meditation, worship, and sacraments. Knowing Him more deeply strengthens your spirit.\n    *   **Renewing your mind:** Filling your thoughts with God's truth (Romans 12:2), especially passages affirming your identity in Christ and His design for sexuality.\n    *   **Finding faithful Christian community:** Surrounding yourself with believers who will love you unconditionally, support you, pray with you, and hold you accountable (Galatians 6:1-2, Hebrews 10:24-25). *Crucially, this community must uphold biblical standards while offering radical grace.*\n    *   **Seeking wise, professional counsel:** Christian therapists specializing in sexual identity struggles can provide invaluable tools for understanding your feelings, developing healthy coping mechanisms, and processing past experiences. Resources like Desert AIMS or Harvest USA offer faith-based support.\n    *   **Practicing sexual purity:** Making conscious choices to abstain from sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage, and learning to redirect sexual energy into other areas of life (service, creativity, deep friendships).\n    *   **Embracing your singleness or pursuing heterosexual marriage:** God calls some to singleness for His kingdom purposes (1 Corinthians 7:7-8, 32-35). If you feel called to marriage, seeking a spouse of the opposite sex is the path within God's design. This is a deeply personal journey before the Lord.\n\n**5. The Church's Call: Be Ambassadors of Christ's Love:**\n*   **Scripture:** \"All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors.\" (2 Corinthians 5:18-20)\n*   **Truth:** The Church is called to be a place of healing, grace, and truth. Believers are called to love others as Christ loved us – sacrificially, unconditionally, while also speaking the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). Your presence in the church community is vital. Your struggle is not a disqualification; it is an opportunity for the Body of Christ to learn deeper compassion, to practice true grace without compromise, and to point everyone, including you, to the transforming power of the Gospel. Your journey towards holiness is a witness to God's faithfulness.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\n*   **Yes, you absolutely can be a Christian and experience same-sex attraction.** Your feelings do not negate your salvation or God's love for you.\n*   **No, God does NOT hate you.** He loves you with an everlasting love, demonstrated through the sacrifice of His Son. Your struggle breaks His heart, but His love for you remains constant.\n*   **Your journey involves:** Unwavering trust in God's love, embracing your identity in Christ, resisting temptation through the power of the Holy Spirit, pursuing holiness in thought, word, and deed, finding supportive community, and seeking wise counsel.\n*   **Your struggle is a call to deeper dependence on Christ and deeper community within the Body.**\n\nThis is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be moments of victory and moments of profound struggle. In both, run to the Cross. When you stumble, His grace is there to lift you (1 John 2:1-2). When you feel alone, remember you are never outside His presence or His love (Psalm 139:7-10). Your feelings are real, but they are not the final word. God's Word is.\n\nI encourage you to find a mature, compassionate pastor or counselor who can walk alongside you personally. You are deeply loved by God, and He has a purpose and a future for you (Jeremiah 29:11). Hold fast to the truth that in Christ, you are a new creation, and the old is gone. Let's pray together for strength, clarity, and the deepening of your love for the One who first loved you.\n\n**Resources to Explore:**\n*   **Desert AIMS (Arizona Intensive Ministry Support):** Offers Christ-centered support groups and resources.\n*   **Harvest USA:** Provides resources and support for those seeking to align their sexuality with biblical teaching.\n*   **\"Love into Light\" by David Bennett:** A powerful testimony of finding freedom in Christ.\n*   **\"The Gay Gospel?\" by Alan Shlemon:** A concise, biblical analysis of the topic.\n\nYou are not defined by your feelings, but by Christ's sacrifice and your identity as His child. Press into Him.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy on sexuality and salvation. It affirms that same-sex attraction is not sin by itself, while acting on it outside biblical boundaries is considered sin; it upholds that true identity is in Christ, not in sexual feelings; it maintains that Christians should pursue holiness, rely on God’s grace, and seek supportive Christian community. It correctly uses or alludes to key scriptures (Romans 5:8; Jeremiah 31:3; 1 John 3:1; Galatians 3:26-28; 2 Corinthians 5:17; James 1:14-15; 1 Corinthians 6:18-19; 1 Corinthians 10:13; 2 Corinthians 12:9; Psalm 139:13-16; Genesis 2:24; 1 Corinthians 7:7-8) and applies them to the SSA context with clarity about temptation versus sin, and about boundaries within marriage. It also emphasizes grace, forgiveness, and pastoral care, including seeking wise counsel and community support. Nuanced aspects are present: distinction between temptation and formal sexual sin, acknowledgement that different pastoral paths exist (celibacy or heterosexual marriage) without compromising biblical ethics, and the call to witness to Christ’s love in the church. A potential caveat (not a doctrinal error) is that the pastoral emphasis on heterosexual marriage as a viable path can be sensitive in diverse church contexts, but it remains within a conservative-orthodox reading of Scripture. Overall, the response is characteristic of sound evangelical teaching on this topic."
