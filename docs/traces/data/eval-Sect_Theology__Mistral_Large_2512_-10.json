    "input": "Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science, wrote 'Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,' which Christian Scientists study alongside the Bible as authoritative revelation. What's the orthodox Christian perspective on this?",
    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity rejects placing any human writing on par with Scripture's unique divine authority. While commentaries, theological works, and devotional writings can be helpful, the Bible alone is the inspired, inerrant Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16-17). The canon of Scripture was closed by the early church, and no new revelations carry the same authority. Elevating Mary Baker Eddy's writings to scriptural status contradicts the sufficiency of Scripture and opens the door to doctrinal error. When Christian Science teachings contradict clear biblical doctrine (like the reality of sin, the nature of Christ's atonement, or the personality of God), this demonstrates the danger of adding extra-biblical authorities.",
    "output": "Mary Baker Eddy’s *Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures* (1875) is a foundational text for Christian Science, a movement that emerged in 19th-century America. From an orthodox Christian perspective—rooted in historic creeds (e.g., the Apostles’ Creed, Nicene Creed) and the authority of Scripture alone (*sola Scriptura*)—Eddy’s work presents significant theological departures from traditional Christian doctrine. Below is a respectful but theologically precise analysis of its relationship to orthodox Christianity, highlighting areas of agreement and divergence.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Areas of Superficial Agreement**\nWhile Christian Science and orthodox Christianity share some terminology, their underlying meanings often differ radically. Points of apparent overlap include:\n\n- **Affirmation of God’s Goodness and Love**: Both traditions emphasize God’s benevolence (e.g., 1 John 4:8). Eddy writes, *\"God is Love\"* (*Science and Health*, p. 113), echoing Scripture (1 John 4:16). However, her definition of \"Love\" as an impersonal divine principle (rather than a personal, triune God) diverges from orthodoxy.\n- **Jesus as Exemplar**: Christian Science and Christianity both revere Jesus as a central figure. Eddy calls him *\"the Way-shower\"* (*S&H*, p. 316), but she denies his divinity in the orthodox sense (see below).\n- **Healing**: Both traditions value healing, but Christian Science redefines it as the correction of \"false beliefs\" about matter, while orthodox Christianity attributes healing to God’s sovereign will (e.g., James 5:14–15) and the redemptive work of Christ.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Core Departures from Orthodox Christianity**\nChristian Science’s theology diverges from historic Christian doctrine in several critical ways, which orthodox Christians regard as heretical or incompatible with biblical revelation:\n\n#### **A. The Nature of God**\n- **Orthodox Christianity**: God is the triune, personal Creator (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) who is distinct from His creation (Genesis 1:1; Matthew 28:19). He is both transcendent and immanent, sovereign over all things.\n- **Christian Science**: Eddy redefines God as an impersonal *\"divine Principle\"*—*\"Life, Truth, Love\"* (*S&H*, p. 465). This God is not a person but an abstract force, akin to pantheism or panentheism. The Trinity is rejected as a \"human invention\" (*S&H*, p. 256), and Jesus is not the eternal Son of God but a man who demonstrated the \"Christ idea\" (a divine impersonal principle).\n\n  **Orthodox Response**: The Bible consistently presents God as personal (e.g., Genesis 1:26–27; Exodus 3:14; John 1:1–14). The Trinity is a non-negotiable doctrine, affirmed by the early church (e.g., Athanasian Creed) and rooted in Scripture (e.g., Matthew 3:16–17; 28:19).\n\n#### **B. The Nature of Christ**\n- **Orthodox Christianity**: Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, fully divine and fully human (John 1:1, 14; Colossians 2:9), who died for sins and rose bodily (1 Corinthians 15:3–4).\n- **Christian Science**: Eddy denies Jesus’ divinity, teaching that he was a man who manifested the *\"Christ idea\"* (*S&H*, p. 332). His crucifixion is dismissed as a \"mistake\" (*S&H*, p. 45), and his resurrection is spiritualized as a \"demonstration\" of the unreality of death (*S&H*, p. 44). The atonement is rejected; sin is merely an illusion to be overcome by right thinking.\n\n  **Orthodox Response**: The New Testament unequivocally affirms Christ’s divinity (John 1:1; Philippians 2:6; Hebrews 1:3) and the necessity of his sacrificial death (Romans 3:25; 1 Peter 2:24). The resurrection is central to Christian hope (1 Corinthians 15:14).\n\n#### **C. The Nature of Reality (Ontology)**\n- **Orthodox Christianity**: The material world is real, created \"very good\" by God (Genesis 1:31), though marred by sin (Romans 8:20–22). Matter and spirit are distinct but both real.\n- **Christian Science**: Eddy teaches that matter is an illusion (*\"mortal mind\"* or *\"error\"*), and only the spiritual is real (*S&H*, p. 468). Sin, sickness, and death are not actual but products of false belief. This stems from her interpretation of Genesis 3, where the \"fall\" is a metaphor for humanity’s mistaken belief in matter.\n\n  **Orthodox Response**: The Bible presents matter as real and good (e.g., John 1:14; Colossians 1:16–17). Sin and death are objective realities (Romans 5:12), not illusions. Jesus’ physical resurrection (Luke 24:39) and the promise of bodily resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:51–53) affirm the goodness of the material world.\n\n#### **D. The Authority of Scripture**\n- **Orthodox Christianity**: The Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God (*sola Scriptura*), the final authority for faith and practice (2 Timothy 3:16–17; 2 Peter 1:20–21).\n- **Christian Science**: Eddy elevates *Science and Health* to co-equal authority with the Bible, claiming it *\"corrects\"* Scripture (*S&H*, p. 114). She reinterprets biblical passages through her metaphysical lens (e.g., Genesis 1–3 as allegory, not history).\n\n  **Orthodox Response**: While Christians affirm the need for sound interpretation (2 Peter 1:20), no extra-biblical text can supersede Scripture. Eddy’s claims to \"correct\" the Bible place her in the role of a new revelator, which orthodox Christianity rejects (Revelation 22:18–19).\n\n#### **E. Salvation and Sin**\n- **Orthodox Christianity**: Salvation is by grace through faith in Christ’s atoning work (Ephesians 2:8–9). Sin is a real, universal condition (Romans 3:23) requiring divine forgiveness.\n- **Christian Science**: Salvation is achieved through *\"Christian Science treatment\"*—correcting one’s thoughts to align with divine Principle. Sin is an illusion; there is no need for atonement or repentance in the biblical sense (*S&H*, p. 473).\n\n  **Orthodox Response**: The Bible teaches that all have sinned (Romans 3:23) and that Christ’s death is the only remedy (Acts 4:12). Denying sin’s reality undermines the gospel (1 John 1:8–10).\n\n#### **F. The Afterlife**\n- **Orthodox Christianity**: Heaven and hell are real, eternal destinations (Matthew 25:46; Revelation 20:14–15). The resurrection of the body is central (1 Corinthians 15:52).\n- **Christian Science**: Heaven and hell are states of mind, not literal places (*S&H*, p. 291). Death is an illusion, and the afterlife is a progression toward spiritual perfection.\n\n  **Orthodox Response**: Jesus’ teachings on judgment (Matthew 25:31–46) and Paul’s defense of the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15) affirm the reality of eternal destinies.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Orthodox Christian Critique**\nFrom an orthodox perspective, Christian Science’s departures are not merely differences in emphasis but fundamental rejections of core Christian doctrines. Key concerns include:\n\n1. **Denial of the Incarnation**: By rejecting Christ’s divinity and humanity, Christian Science undermines the hypostatic union (Chalcedonian Definition), a non-negotiable Christian truth.\n2. **Rejection of the Atonement**: The cross is emptied of its redemptive power, contradicting the heart of the gospel (1 Corinthians 1:18).\n3. **Gnostic Tendencies**: The devaluation of matter and elevation of secret knowledge (*gnosis*) aligns with ancient Gnosticism, which the early church condemned (e.g., Irenaeus’ *Against Heresies*).\n4. **Self-Salvation**: Christian Science’s emphasis on human thought as salvific replaces grace with works, contradicting Ephesians 2:8–9.\n5. **Biblical Authority**: Elevating *Science and Health* to the level of Scripture violates the Reformation principle of *sola Scriptura*.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Respectful Engagement**\nWhile orthodox Christians firmly reject Christian Science’s theology, engagement with its adherents should be marked by:\n- **Clarity**: Gently correcting misunderstandings of biblical doctrine (e.g., the nature of God, sin, and salvation).\n- **Compassion**: Recognizing that many Christian Scientists are sincere seekers of truth and healing.\n- **Prayer**: Trusting the Holy Spirit to open hearts to the gospel (John 16:13).\n- **Humility**: Acknowledging that all Christians are works in progress, dependent on God’s grace.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nMary Baker Eddy’s *Science and Health* represents a radical reinterpretation of Christianity that departs from orthodox doctrine at nearly every major point. While it shares some Christian terminology, its metaphysical framework—rooted in 19th-century New Thought philosophy—is incompatible with historic Christian faith. Orthodox Christianity affirms the Bible as the sole infallible authority, the triune God as personal and sovereign, the reality of sin and matter, and the necessity of Christ’s atoning work. Christian Science’s denial of these truths places it outside the bounds of Christian orthodoxy, though its adherents remain objects of Christian love and evangelistic concern.\n\nFor further study, orthodox Christians may consult:\n- The *Nicene Creed* (325/381 AD)\n- The *Chalcedonian Definition* (451 AD)\n- *Against Heresies* by Irenaeus (2nd century)\n- *The Fundamentals* (early 20th-century defense of orthodoxy)\n- *Christianity and Liberalism* by J. Gresham Machen (1923)",
