          "rationale": "The answer correctly identifies the explicit audience in Matthew (the disciples) and notes the presence of the crowds in the narrative. It cites Matthew 5:1-2 as evidence and acknowledges Luke’s parallel (Sermon on the Plain) as illustrating a broader audience. The response also conveys scholarly nuance by mentioning the traditional view that Matthew targets the disciples primarily, while some scholars stress a broader (disciples plus crowds) readership and moral instruction for the community. This aligns with standard historical/contextual understandings and directly addresses the question, though the phrasing could be interpreted as prioritizing the disciples over the crowds (which is a common but not exclusive interpretation)."
