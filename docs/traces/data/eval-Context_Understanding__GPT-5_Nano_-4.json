          "rationale": "The LLM accurately states that Matthew 5:1–2 presents Jesus teaching primarily to his disciples, with the crowds present. It reflects the mainstream scholarly view that the Sermon serves as ethical instruction for the kingdom community (the followers/new Israel) while acknowledging that the broader crowd could witness or apply the teaching. It also notes the scholarly debate: while the traditional/major view sees disciples as the primary addressees, some scholars see broader applicability. The grammatical cue in Matthew 5:1–2 supporting the disciples as the primary addressees is correctly cited. The response thus aligns well with historical-contextual analysis. The only subtle deviation from the expected answer is the emphasis on disciples as the primary audience, with the crowds acknowledged as present; this is a standard and well-supported nuance. No factual errors are present."
