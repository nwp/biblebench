This dual audience is well-documented in Scripture (e.g., 5:1–2 notes the crowds and the disciples; the sermon content is directed to the disciples but publicly delivered). The statement aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy and is grounded in Scripture. A fuller nuance could mention that the teaching functions as normative instruction for all who follow Jesus, not just the original listeners, but the core claim about the audience is accurate."
