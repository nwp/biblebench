          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the teaching as Docetism and accurately summarizes the orthodox response: Jesus possesses a genuine physical body, is truly human and truly divine (hypostatic union), and incarnational reality is essential for salvation. It cites supporting biblical evidence in line with orthodox interpretation (Luke 24:42-43; John 20:27; Luke 24:39; Hebrews 2:14-17) and references key historical affirmations (Nicaea, Chalcedon). It notes that denying true humanity undermines redemption and the Incarnation (consistent with Hebrews 2:17 and John 1:14). The reasoning also addresses theological problems commonly raised by docetists, such as the necessity of Jesus’ humanity for representation and atonement, and it situates the issue within early church polemics against docetism. Scope and emphasis align with standard doctrinal summaries and creedal orthodoxy. A minor potential improvement would be to explicitly cite 1 John 4:2-3 as a direct New Testament battlement against denial of Christ’s flesh (the response instead emphasizes Hebrews 2:17 and John 1:14), but this is not doctrinally erroneous. Overall, the evaluation is accurate, well-grounded in Scripture, and faithful to historic orthodoxy. "
