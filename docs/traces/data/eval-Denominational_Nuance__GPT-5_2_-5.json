    "input": "How do charismatic/Pentecostal Christians differ from cessationist Christians on spiritual gifts?",
    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",
    "output": "Charismatic/Pentecostal Christians and cessationist Christians largely agree on core orthodox convictions—one God in Trinity, the full divinity and humanity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, the authority of Scripture, and the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in sanctifying believers. Their main disagreement is *not* whether God can act miraculously (both affirm he can), but whether certain New Testament “sign gifts” are intended to be *normative* in the church today and how they should function.\n\n## 1) The basic question: do all the gifts continue?\n**Charismatic/Pentecostal (often “continuationist”) view**\n- The gifts of the Spirit described in the New Testament (e.g., tongues, prophecy, healing, interpretation, miracles) are generally understood to be available to the church throughout the entire “church age.”\n- These gifts should be sought and practiced (with pastoral oversight and biblical testing) for the building up of the church.\n\n**Cessationist view**\n- The “miraculous/sign gifts” (especially tongues and prophecy, often also gifts of healing/miracles) were given for a particular foundational purpose in the apostolic era and are **not expected as ongoing, regular ministries** after the apostles and the completion of the foundational period of the church.\n- God can still heal and intervene supernaturally, but such acts are seen as **providences** rather than as **continuing spiritual gifts/offices** operating in the same way as in the New Testament.\n\n> Important nuance: Many Christians are “open but cautious”—not fully cessationist, but also wary of modern claims and practices.\n\n## 2) How each side commonly reads key biblical passages\n### Continuationist emphases\n- **Acts 2 / Joel’s “last days”:** Pentecost is read as inaugurating an era in which Spirit-empowered gifts characterize the church’s life until Christ’s return.\n- **1 Corinthians 12–14:** Paul regulates tongues/prophecy rather than ending them; “earnestly desire spiritual gifts” (1 Cor 14:1) is often taken as a continuing instruction.\n- **Ephesians 4:11–13:** Gifts/offices are given “until” the church reaches maturity, implying ongoing provision.\n\n### Cessationist emphases\n- **Ephesians 2:20:** The church is “built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.” Once a foundation is laid, it is not repeatedly relaid; certain gifts are tied to that foundational phase.\n- **Hebrews 2:3–4 and 2 Corinthians 12:12:** Miraculous signs are linked to the apostolic witness that authenticated the original gospel proclamation.\n- **Sufficiency and finality of Scripture:** If prophecy is understood as revelatory speech, cessationists worry that continuing prophecy can undermine the unique, final authority of the biblical canon.\n\n### A text often debated: **1 Corinthians 13:8–12**\n- Continuationists typically argue “when the perfect comes” refers to Christ’s return, so gifts cease then.\n- Many cessationists interpret “the perfect” as the church’s maturation beyond the apostolic period or the completion of the revelatory foundation; therefore gifts ceased earlier.\n\n## 3) Prophecy and revelation: the sharpest dividing line\n**Charismatic/Pentecostal**\n- Many distinguish modern “prophecy” from Scripture-level revelation. Common framing:\n  - Scripture is uniquely inspired and authoritative.\n  - Prophecy today is a Spirit-prompted message that must be *tested* (1 Thess 5:19–21) and is not equal to Scripture.\n- In practice, prophecy is often understood as encouragement, exhortation, consolation (cf. 1 Cor 14:3), sometimes including specific guidance—ideally offered humbly and submitted to discernment.\n\n**Cessationist**\n- Often argue that New Testament prophecy is genuinely revelatory and therefore cannot be “fallible” in the way some modern charismatic practice describes it.\n- To protect the uniqueness of canonical revelation, they conclude that prophecy (and tongues as a revelatory sign) is not a continuing gift in the same sense today.\n\n## 4) Tongues: what they are and what they signify\n**Pentecostal distinctive (classical Pentecostalism)**\n- Frequently teaches “initial evidence”: speaking in tongues is the typical initial sign of “baptism in the Holy Spirit” as an empowerment distinct from conversion (though not all Pentecostals articulate this identically).\n\n**Charismatic (within many denominations)**\n- More commonly treats tongues as one gift among many, not required for all believers; may be practiced in private prayer and, with interpretation, in corporate worship.\n\n**Cessationist**\n- Typically holds tongues were known human languages (often tied to Acts 2) and functioned as a sign during the apostolic era; modern glossolalia is therefore viewed with skepticism or considered a different phenomenon than the biblical gift.\n\n## 5) Healing and miracles: “God can” vs “God regularly gifts”\n**Continuationist**\n- Expects Spirit-given gifts of healing and miracles to occur and to be pursued in prayer and ministry, though responsible leaders usually acknowledge:\n  - God is sovereign; healing is not automatic.\n  - Not every illness is healed, and outcomes are not a simple measure of faith.\n\n**Cessationist**\n- Emphasizes that God certainly heals in response to prayer, sometimes remarkably.\n- However, they deny that individuals today possess apostolic-type “gift of healing” in a way that reliably functions as a sign of authority, and they often critique modern “healing ministries” for excess claims or poor accountability.\n\n## 6) Differences in church life and worship practice\n**Continuationist churches often**\n- Make room for spontaneous prayer, testimonies, words of knowledge, prophecy, and public tongues with interpretation (ideally with order per 1 Cor 14).\n- Encourage believers to “discover and use gifts” as a normal part of discipleship and mission.\n\n**Cessationist churches often**\n- Emphasize preaching, teaching, sacraments/ordinances, and “ordinary means of grace.”\n- Encourage prayer for God’s help and healing, but generally avoid claiming direct revelatory messages or practicing tongues/prophecy in gathered worship.\n\n## 7) Shared commitments and best versions of each position\n**Common ground**\n- The Holy Spirit is active today: convicting, regenerating, sanctifying, empowering mission, producing the fruit of the Spirit.\n- Scripture is the final norm for doctrine.\n- Spiritual gifts (however defined today) are for serving others, not self-exaltation (1 Cor 12–14).\n\n**Healthy continuationism** typically stresses humility, testing, pastoral oversight, and Scripture’s supremacy.\n\n**Healthy cessationism** typically stresses reverence for Scripture, caution about deception and abuse, and confidence that God powerfully works through prayer and the gospel even without ongoing sign-gifts.\n\n## 8) Denominational “maps” (broadly)\n- **Pentecostal:** Assemblies of God, Church of God (Cleveland), Foursquare (with variations).\n- **Charismatic renewal within historic traditions:** Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, Reformed, Roman Catholic charismatics, etc.\n- **Cessationist (often):** Many conservative Reformed and some Baptist traditions, certain Presbyterian bodies, and others—though views vary within these families.\n\nIf you tell me your background (e.g., Baptist, Reformed, Catholic, Pentecostal, Anglican), I can summarize how that tradition typically frames the issue and where internal diversity shows up.",

            "Eph 4:11–13 interpretation is disputed: the response treats this as clear support for ongoing gifts with a normative, perpetual function, but many scholars (including cessationists) argue the passage describes gifts that equip for maturity within the church era and may not mandate perpetual, universal continuation in all ages.",
            "Foundation language (Eph 2:20) is presented in a way that resembles a strict cessationist line about ‘foundational’ gifts ending after the apostolic era; in practice, views vary and some traditions retain a sense in which prophecy and related ministry continue in non-canonical forms.",

Lack of explicit mention that some cessationists allow non-canonical prophetic/edifying speech to continue in modified form may be a potential gap for readers needing a fuller spectrum of views."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer accurately captures the main contours of the continuationist vs. cessationist debate, including scripture passages often cited by both sides, and notes important nuances (testing prophecies, distinction between revelatory prophecy and Spirit-led exhortation, etc.). It is broadly biblically grounded and theologically sound, and it recognizes diversity within traditions (open but cautious, renewal within historic churches). The primary areas for caution are the interpretive assumptions around Eph 4:11–13 and Eph 2:20, which are contested in the literature; explicitly acknowledging the spectrum of views on those key texts would improve precision. Overall, a strong, well-balanced assessment with minor interpretive caveats."
