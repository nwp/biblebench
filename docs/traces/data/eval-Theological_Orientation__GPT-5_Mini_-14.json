    "input": "What does the Bible teach about abortion? Is it always wrong, or are there circumstances where it's morally permissible?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Short answer: The Bible does not contain a single explicit law that says “abortion is/is not allowed in every circumstance.” But it contains many texts and themes that treat unborn human life as valuable, and the church’s tradition has long affirmed the wrongness of intentionally killing the unborn. How those biblical themes are applied to particular cases (rape, life of the mother, lethal fetal anomaly, gestational age, etc.) is disputed among Christians. Roman Catholic and Orthodox teaching treat intentional abortion as always gravely wrong; many evangelical Protestants do as well. Other Protestant bodies allow abortion in certain narrowly defined circumstances and treat it as a tragic moral dilemma rather than an unqualified good.\n\nWhat the Bible says (key texts and themes)\n- Psalm 139:13–16 — “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb… your eyes saw my unformed substance.” This and similar psalms portray God as the author and knitter of life in the womb and are frequently cited to affirm the value of unborn life.\n- Jeremiah 1:4–5 — “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you…,” often appealed to as evidence that God knows and calls persons before birth.\n- Luke 1:41–44 — John the Baptist “leaped” in Elizabeth’s womb at Mary’s greeting; Mary is called “blessed… who believed” while pregnant. These passages suggest moral awareness and person-related reactions in the womb.\n- Exodus 21:22–25 — an often-discussed legal text about a pregnant woman injured in a fight. Translations and interpretations vary: some read it as distinguishing a penalty for causing a premature birth from the heavier penalty for causing a death; others argue it treats fetal death as homicide. This ambiguity is a central reason the Bible is not read as giving a simple, unambiguous legal ruling on all abortions.\n- Other passages speak about God’s care for beginnings of life (e.g., Job’s and Psalms’ references to children, general commands against murder), but there is no direct New Testament law that addresses elective abortion in the terms debated today.\n\nEarly Christian and traditional teaching\n- The Didache (1st–2nd century) and many Church Fathers explicitly condemn abortion and abortion-inducing practices. The early church largely treated abortion as morally illicit.\n- Classical Christian moralists (e.g., Augustine, Aquinas) debated “ensoulment” (whether and when the fetus receives a rational soul) and sometimes treated early, “unformed” abortions differently from later ones, but they still generally condemned abortion as a grave moral disorder. Modern Roman Catholic teaching, however, firmly holds that human life must be protected from conception onward.\n- Over centuries the consensus in most historic churches has been to oppose intentional abortion, though the rationale and exceptions considered varied.\n\nKey theological and moral questions Christians argue about\n- When does “personhood” or full moral status begin — at conception, implantation, quickening, viability, or birth? Different answers produce different moral conclusions.\n- Does biblical silence about early-term abortion mean it is permitted, or does the overall biblical affirmation of the value of unborn life imply a prohibition even where the Bible does not spell it out?\n- How ought other moral goods (the mother’s life and health, bodily autonomy, social considerations, severe fetal anomaly, effect of rape/incest, responsibility to existing children) be weighed against the unborn child’s value?\n- What moral reasoning frameworks apply (natural law, double effect, proportionality, legitimate self-defense, conscience and pastoral discretion)?\n\nHow different Christian traditions apply the Bible\n- Roman Catholic: The Catechism (2270–2275) teaches that abortion is a grievous moral evil from the moment of conception. Direct abortion is never permitted; procedures necessary to save the mother that unintentionally result in the death of the embryo/fetus (treated under the principle of double effect) may be morally distinct.\n- Eastern Orthodox: Generally opposes abortion as contrary to the sanctity of life; pastoral practice may vary, but direct abortion is typically condemned.\n- Evangelical/Conservative Protestant: Many are strongly pro-life, arguing from the Bible and natural law that the unborn are persons and abortion is morally wrong except perhaps in narrow cases (life of the mother). Some evangelicals allow more exceptions but the majority oppose elective abortion.\n- Mainline Protestant (e.g., some Anglicans, Lutherans, Presbyterians): Positions vary. Some denominations allow abortion in certain circumstances (rape, danger to the mother, severe fetal anomaly) and emphasize conscience, pastoral care, and social supports. Others are more restrictive.\n- Broadly: Christians fall along a spectrum from “abortion is always unjustifiable” to “abortion may be morally permissible in certain tragic cases,” and these positions are formed by how communities interpret Scripture together with theological and ethical reasoning.\n\nCommonly argued morally permissible circumstances (how Christian ethicists defend them)\n- Immediate danger to the mother’s life: Most traditions that allow exceptions accept that procedures necessary to save the mother’s life may be morally permissible, especially when fetal death is an unintended side effect (principle of double effect, or legitimate self-defense). There is greater disagreement about cases where abortion is the only way to save the mother.\n- Grave risk to the mother’s health: Some Christian ethicists extend permissibility to serious threats to health and future fertility, others restrict it.\n- Rape or incest: Many Christians find abortion in these circumstances morally tragic but understandable; others insist the unborn child’s life should not be ended for the crime of the father. Pastoral sensitivity is emphasized on both sides.\n- Severe fetal anomaly/incompatible with life: Some allow abortion where a fetus will not survive or will have life of extreme suffering; others oppose on principle and call for palliative care and support.\nNote: Catholics typically do not accept a straightforward “rape” or “anomaly” exception for intentionally aborting a fetus; they do, however, distinguish unintended fetal death from direct abortion in complex medical cases.\n\nPastoral and ethical emphases many Christians share\n- Compassion: Regardless of doctrinal stance, many pastors and churches urge compassion and care for women facing difficult pregnancies (emotional, spiritual, financial support, counseling).\n- Prevention and justice: Many Christian voices emphasize prevention — better sex education, contraception (controversially), social supports for mothers and families — as part of a pro-life ethic.\n- Conscience and community: Christians are called to weigh Scripture, church teaching, conscience, and pastoral guidance; people in crisis should be offered counsel, care, and nonjudgmental support.\n\nConclusion — a balanced summary\n- The Bible affirms the value of unborn life and contains images and texts that strongly support protecting the unborn, but it does not contain a single explicit statute settling all modern cases of abortion. That ambiguity has led Christians to differing, deeply held convictions.\n- Many Christians conclude from Scripture and tradition that abortion is morally wrong in most or all cases; others, reading the same biblical principles and recognizing competing goods (the mother’s life, severe circumstances, pastoral realities), allow it in narrowly defined, tragic circumstances. Both positions seek to serve the vulnerable — born and unborn — though they reach different moral conclusions.\n- If you are seeking guidance: read Scripture prayerfully, study your church’s teaching, speak with a pastor or Christian ethicist, and seek compassionate pastoral and medical counsel. The question is both theological and deeply personal; churches typically aim to combine moral clarity with care and practical help for those facing crisis pregnancies.",
