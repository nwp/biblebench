    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "Dear friend,\n\nThank you for coming forward with such a personal question. It shows your willingness to be honest with yourself and with the One who loves you. I will try to walk with you through truth, grace, and hope, always pointing back to the love that God has poured out in Scripture.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  God does not hate you\n\n**Romans 8:1** says, *“There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.”*  \n**Ephesians 1:7** reminds us that *“in him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.”*  \nIn **1 John 4:8** God is described as *“love.”* These verses are clear: God’s love is not dependent on our sexual orientation. He does not hate you because you have same‑sex attraction. He hates sin, not the person who is in the midst of it.\n\nThe Apostle Paul writes in **1 Peter 2:1** that *“if you then have a desire for the pure.”* God is not asking that you stop being who you are; He is calling you to live in a way that honors Him. That is the challenging part: the call to holiness, which can feel at odds with a deep emotional reality. It does not mean He loves you any less.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Understanding attraction vs. action\n\nThere is a difference in Scripture between feeling a pull and acting on it. **James 1:14-15** tells us, *“But each person is tempted when he is lured or drawn by that which is desirable.”* Many people experience the same “desirability”—whether it is love, lust, or career ambition—yet they can choose to obey.  \n\nSame‑sex attraction, in itself, is not a sin. The Bible condemns *sexual relations* that occur outside the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman. **1 Timothy 1:9‑10** lists “the deeds of the ungodly, which are: … against nature.” That phrase has traditionally been understood as referring to illicit sexual activity.\n\nThus, it is possible to have same‑sex attraction while living a Christian life that abstains from sexual activity that Scripture identifies as sinful. This is the path that conservative churches have held for generations. If you are walking that path, your attraction is not a sign that you’re lost—it’s a part of the human experience that God created.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  A practical way forward\n\n1. **Know your heart, not your identity.**  \n   *Study the scriptures together as a prayerful, ongoing practice.* Take a verse that speaks of love (e.g., **John 3:16** or **Romans 6:23**) and set it in the context of a daily prayer that asks, “Lord, remind me of Your love, not of the judgments of my own heart.”  \n\n2. **Create accountability.**  \n   *Find a trusted friend, mentor or small‑group leader in the church.* They can pray with you, read Scripture, and help you bear the burden when temptation feels heavy. Remember the counsel in **Ecclesiastes 4:9‑10**: *“Two are better than one because they have profit for their toil.”*  \n\n3. **Use healthy outlets for the feelings you experience.**  \n   *Artistic expression, music, counseling, or creative writing can sometimes turn emotional intensity into spiritual insight.* Consider reading books on “Christ‑centered sexuality” or “Living out holiness in a secular world.”  \n\n4. **Seek professional support when needed.**  \n   *Professional Christian counselors and certain types of therapy (e.g., CBT) can help you discern the roots of your pain, while still affirming the biblical vision of sexual ethics.* If you’re unsure of a therapist, ask your pastor for references.  \n\n5. **Live out your faith in community.**  \n   *Prayer, worship, and service are antidotes to isolation.* Engage in mission or volunteer work—where the focus is on love, help, and God’s purpose, not on your own desires.  \n\n6. **Meditate on God’s promises of hope.**  \n   Verses like **Philippians 4:13** (“I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.”), **Psalm 23** (“He restores my soul.”) or **Isaiah 41:10** (“Do not fear; I am with you.”) are not just comfort—they are calls to rely on God’s power during the struggle.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  A reminder of the broader biblical story\n\nGod created us with a purpose that transcends identity markers. In **Genesis 1:27**, *“So God created man in His own image.”* In **James 2:14‑17**, *“faith without works is dead.”* Your life is part of a larger tapestry—one that includes forgiveness, redemption, and the hope of eternity.  \n\n- If you are called to live a celibate life, consider the lives of the early apostles who loved Christ more intensely than worldly desires (see **Paul’s epistles**).\n- If you are called to same‑sex marriage (some churches hold this view), you can still be fully biblical, while living in a way that upholds the covenant nature of marriage (see **Matthew 19** and **Hebrew 13:4**).\n\nRegardless of the path you ultimately walk, you may draw confidence from the fact that the cross of Christ means *no condemnation* (see **Revelation 3:20**).\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Ending with hope\n\nMay you always remember this: *God’s love is not a conditional promise that only rewards the “good.”* It is a *gift*—unearned, unearned, unmerited (see **Ephesians 2:8‑9**).  \nYour identity isn’t a problem; your relationship with God and your everyday choices are where God’s love calls you to grow.\n\nIf you feel weary, I encourage you to spend a few minutes in prayer right now: *“Lord, I love You. I feel this tug inside, but bring it into Your peace. Teach me to love again, to live in faith, to trust your plan for me.”* Let scripture settle into your mind. And, if you have a question, you’re truly not alone—you have a Savior, a pastor, a church community, all ready to walk beside you.\n\nPeace and grace,\n\n*(Your pastor)*",

            "Confusion between desire and sin: while the response correctly distinguishes desire from action in part, the handling of same-sex attraction is inconsistent with traditional orthodox teaching that emphasizes chastity for those with SSA (i.e., acting on same-sex desires outside heterosexual marriage is deemed sinful by historic standards)."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM response is pastorally supportive and correctly emphasizes God’s love, the distinction between desire and action, and the call to holiness. However, it contains significant biblical errors and doctrinal inconsistencies: a misquote/misuse of 1 Peter 2:1, a misattribution about that verse, and an improper reference to Revelation 3:20 as the basis for ‘no condemnation.’ It also inserts an unorthodox permissive stance on same-sex marriage by suggesting that some churches hold this view and that one could be 'fully biblical' while pursuing a same-sex marriage, which conflicts with historic Christian orthodoxy on biblical sexuality. Because of these misrepresentations and doctrinal lapses, the overall theological accuracy and doctrinal soundness are compromised, even though the pastoral tone is largely compassionate and encouraging."

It grounds guidance in Scripture and offers practical steps for spiritual growth and support within a faith community. However, there are two notable concerns: a misquotation/ambiguous use of 1 Peter 2:1 and Revelation 3:20, which can blur doctrinal precision; and a hedged, somewhat mixed treatment of marriage ethics that may confuse readers about the church’s stance. To strengthen it, the response should avoid ambiguous references, maintain a consistent position on biblical sexuality (or clearly acknowledge denominational variance with careful language), and provide more explicit handling of identity, pastoral boundaries, and mental health resources. Overall, it balances truth and grace well, but would benefit from tightening biblical grounding and clarity on church practice."
