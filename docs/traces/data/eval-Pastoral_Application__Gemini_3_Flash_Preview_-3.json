    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "My dear friend, I want to start by simply sitting in the dust with you for a moment. I am so deeply sorry for the unspeakable loss of your child. There are no words in the human language that can bridge the gap between the life you had and the reality you are now facing.\n\nWhen people say \"it’s God’s will\" or \"everything happens for a reason,\" they are usually trying to be helpful, trying to find some scaffolding to hold up a collapsing world. But often, those words feel less like comfort and more like a weight.\n\nLet’s look together at what the Scriptures actually say about God, death, and His \"will.\"\n\n### 1. God is not the Author of Death\nThe first thing you must know is that death was never part of God’s original design. Genesis tells us that death entered the world through sin (Romans 5:12). God calls death \"the last enemy\" (1 Corinthians 15:26). \n\nWhen someone says it was \"God’s will,\" we must be careful with our definitions. There is God’s *perfect* will—a world of peace, life, and no tears—and there is God’s *permissive* will, where He allows a broken world to operate according to the laws of nature and the consequences of a fallen creation. A car accident is a result of a fractured world, not a divine \"hit\" ordered from the throne of grace. God did not take your child; death, the enemy, did.\n\n### 2. God Weeps With You\nYou asked how a loving God could will this. Look at Jesus at the tomb of His friend Lazarus in John 11. Even though Jesus knew He was about to raise Lazarus from the dead, the Bible says, \"Jesus wept.\" \n\nHe didn't stand by and say, \"Don't cry, this is part of the plan.\" He was deeply moved and indignant at the pain death causes. If you want to know how God feels about your child’s death, look at the tears of Jesus. He is not a distant clockmaker watching this unfold; He is the \"Man of Sorrows, acquainted with grief\" (Isaiah 53:3). He is \"close to the brokenhearted\" (Psalm 34:18).\n\n### 3. \"Everything Happens for a Reason\" vs. God’s Redemption\nRomans 8:28 is often misquoted to grieving parents. It does *not* say \"everything that happens is good.\" It says that \"God works all things together for good for those who love Him.\" \n\nThere is a massive difference between saying God *caused* a tragedy for a reason, and saying God can *use* a tragedy to eventually bring about something meaningful. Your child’s death is a tragedy, full stop. It is a violation of the way things ought to be. God’s \"will\" is not the accident; God’s \"will\" is the resurrection, the comfort He offers you now, and the promise that He will have the final word over the grave.\n\n### 4. It Is Okay to Wrestle\nThe Bible is full of \"Lament\"—a form of prayer where we cry out \"How long, O Lord?\" and \"Why?\" Job, David, and Jeremiah all questioned God’s sovereignty in the midst of pain. God did not strike them down for their honesty; He met them in it. You do not need to protect God’s reputation by pretending you aren’t angry or confused. He can handle your \"Why?\"\n\n### Practical Steps for Your Soul:\n*   **Give yourself permission to grieve:** Do not let anyone’s \"theology\" rush your mourning. Grief is the price we pay for love, and it takes time.\n*   **Reject the \"Divine Blueprint\" trap:** You do not have to believe that God pushed that car or stopped a heart to prove He is in control. He is in control because He is the one who will eventually \"wipe away every tear\" and \"make all things new\" (Revelation 21:4-5).\n*   **Look to the Cross:** When it feels like God doesn't care about the death of a child, remember that God is the only God who knows exactly what you are feeling. He watched His own Son die a violent, unfair death. He didn’t do it because He loved death; He did it to defeat death forever.\n\nFriend, your child is safe in the arms of the Shepherd. And right now, that same Shepherd wants to carry you. Don’t worry about having the \"right\" faith today. Just hold onto the hem of His garment and let Him weep with you.",

          "rationale": "Overall, the LLM response is pastorally sensitive and theologically solid. It correctly affirms several biblically grounded truths and handles a difficult topic with care:\n\n- Theological accuracy and biblical grounding:\n  - It correctly notes that death entered the world through sin and that death is an enemy (Romans 5:12; 1 Corinthians 15:26), which aligns with Scripture.\n  - It distinguishes between God’s perfect will and God’s permissive presence in a fallen world, framing the car accident as a consequence of a broken creation rather than a direct, intentional act of God. This mirrors common evangelical-theological distinctions about sovereignty and the problem of evil, though it should be noted that terms like “permissive will” are pastoral frameworks rather than explicit biblical phrases.\n  - It emphasizes that God does not delight in death and that Jesus wept at Lazarus’ tomb, underscoring God’s solidarity with human grief (John 11:35; Psalm 34:18; Isaiah 53:3). This captures the biblical motif of a suffering God who is near the brokenhearted.\n  - It carefully handles Romans 8:28 by clarifying that not everything that happens is good in itself, but God can work all things for good for those who love Him, which preserves the distinction between a tragedy and God’s redemptive purposes (Romans 8:28).\n  - It upholds the central Christian focus on the cruciform truth: God’s love is shown most clearly in Christ’s death and resurrection, and in God’s ongoing presence with sufferers, including the promise of final restoration (Rev 21:4; Matt 5:4).\n\n- Doctrinal soundness:\n  - The response aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy that God is sovereign, does not tempt or actively ordain evil, and that suffering is allowed within a fallen creation while God can redeem it (Genesis 3, Romans 8, John 11, 1 Corinthians 15).\n  - It avoids blaming the parent or the child for sin and directs the mourner toward lament, trust, and the hope of God’s ultimate victory over death.\n\n- Nuance:\n  - The answer captures important distinctions (will vs. permission, divine sovereignty vs. causalism) and emphasizes lament, honest questioning, and petitionary prayer, which are key biblical practices (Job, Psalms, Lament literature).\n  - It provides practical pastoral steps and anchors comfort in Scripture (Psalm 34:18; Revelation 21:4; Romans 8:28; John 11:35), while avoiding simplistic formulas like “everything happens for a reason” as a blanket justification for suffering.\n\nPossible refinements (minor):\n- The terms “perfect will” and “permissive will” are widely used but not explicit biblical terms; some readers may benefit from a brief note that Scripture doesn’t always disentangle God’s hidden sovereignty from human causality in neat categories. However, the current framing is common in pastoral care and is coherent with the cited verses.\n- A slightly broader scriptural range could be added (e.g., including explicit verses like Psalm 147:3 or Isaiah 61:3 for grief and healing), but the core citations already cover the key doctrines.\n\nIn sum, the LLM response is faithful to Scripture, consistent with historic Christian teaching, and nuanced in its handling of divine sovereignty, human suffering, and the process of lament. It offers compassionate pastoral guidance without endorsing a simplistic cause-and-effect theology for personal tragedy."
