        "expected": "",
        "output": "This depends on which passages you emphasize and how you interpret them:\n\n**Traditional interpretation:**\nSeveral biblical passages explicitly condemn same-sex relations—primarily Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, plus references in Romans 1:26-27 and 1 Corinthians 6:9-11. Denominations holding this view see these as clear prohibitions.\n\n**Progressive/affirming interpretation:**\nMany scholars and religious communities argue:\n- Levitical laws addressed specific cultural contexts (alongside rules now widely ignored)\n- Paul's references may target exploitative practices, not consensual relationships\n- Jesus said nothing explicitly about homosexuality\n- The arc of scripture trends toward inclusion and justice\n\n**In practice:**\n- Catholics, evangelicals, and Orthodox churches typically teach it's sinful\n- Many mainline Protestant, Reform Jewish, and other communities affirm LGBTQ+ relationships\n- Some hold middle-ground positions\n\n**Honest note:**\nThis is one of the most contested questions in modern Christianity. Sincere, thoughtful people read the same texts and reach different conclusions based on their hermeneutical approach—whether they prioritize specific prohibitions, historical context, or broader theological principles.\n\nWhat aspects are you most interested in exploring?",
