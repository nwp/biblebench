The Bible contains a few passages that many readers have understood to condemn same-sex sexual activity, but how those passages apply to modern, consensual, committed same-sex relationships is disputed. Christian communities and scholars disagree.\n\nKey Bible passages people point to\n- Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 — prohibit a man lying with a man “as with a woman.” These are in the Old Testament holiness code; debates focus on whether they are universal moral commands or specific cultic/tribal purity laws.\n- Romans 1:26–27 — Paul describes same-sex behavior in the context of idolatry and “unnatural” passions. Interpreters disagree about whether Paul is condemning all same-sex desire/relationships or particular forms tied to excess, exploitation, or pagan practices.\n- 1 Corinthians 6:9–10 and 1 Timothy 1:9–10 — list words often translated to refer to “homosexuals” or “men who have sex with men.” The Greek terms (e.g., arsenokoitai, malakoi) are contested and have been variously translated as male prostitutes, exploiters, effeminate men, or abusive sexual partners rather than a clear modern category of loving same-sex partners.\n\nTwo broad interpretive approaches\n- Traditional/conservative reading: These passages are taken to prohibit same-sex sexual acts; the Bible’s sexual ethic is understood to require sexual relations only within a man–woman marriage. Many conservative Christians distinguish orientation (not sinful) from behavior (sinful).\n- Progressive/liberal reading: These interpreters argue the specific biblical texts address temple sex, prostitution, exploitative relationships, or non-consensual/pederastic practices rather than loving, monogamous same-sex partnerships; they therefore conclude the Bible does not condemn modern committed same-sex relationships. They also emphasize broader biblical themes of justice, mercy, and faithful love.\n\nHow churches differ\n- Roman Catholic and many evangelical and Orthodox bodies teach that same-sex acts are morally disordered or sinful, while calling for respect and care for gay people.\n- Many mainline Protestant denominations (some Anglican, Lutheran, Presbyterian, United Methodist regional bodies, etc.) permit same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy and interpret the Bible as not condemning loving same-sex relationships.\n- There is a wide spectrum of nuanced positions in between.\n\nIf you want\n- I can list the relevant passages in full and summarize major scholarly interpretations.\n- I can give official statements from specific denominations.\n- I can recommend books or articles from conservative and progressive scholars so you can see both sides.\n\nWhich of those would you like next?",
