    "input": "Some Oneness Pentecostals teach that baptism must be performed 'in Jesus' name only' and that Trinitarian baptism formulas are invalid. What does Scripture teach?",
    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "This analysis addresses the theological divergence between Oneness Pentecostalism and orthodox Christian theology regarding baptismal formulas. To understand this issue, one must examine the specific Oneness interpretation of Scripture, the orthodox Trinitarian consensus, and the exegetical methods used to reconcile the relevant biblical texts.\n\n### 1. The Oneness Pentecostal Position\nOneness Pentecostalism holds to a **Modalist** view of God (historically associated with Sabellianism). They believe that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not three distinct persons, but three modes, titles, or manifestations of one single person: Jesus.\n\nConsequently, their theology regarding baptism is as follows:\n*   **The Argument from the \"Name\":** Oneness theology heavily emphasizes the singular word \"name\" in Matthew 28:19 (\"...baptizing them in the *name* of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\"). They argue that \"Father,\" \"Son,\" and \"Holy Ghost\" are titles, not names. Therefore, they conclude that the singular \"name\" of God—which encompasses all three titles—is **Jesus**.\n*   **The Precedent of Acts:** They point to the narratives in the Book of Acts (Acts 2:38, 8:16, 10:48, 19:5), where baptism is consistently described as being performed \"in the name of Jesus Christ\" or \"in the name of the Lord Jesus.\"\n*   **Conclusion:** They teach that the Apostles in Acts understood the true meaning of Jesus' command in Matthew 28. Therefore, a valid baptism must invoke the name of Jesus specifically to be effectual for the remission of sins. Many Oneness adherents view Trinitarian baptism (using the threefold formula) as invalid, often requiring re-baptism for salvation.\n\n### 2. The Orthodox Christian Position\nOrthodox Christianity (encompassing Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and historic Protestant traditions) adheres to **Trinitarianism**: one God existing eternally in three distinct persons.\n\n*   **The Great Commission:** Orthodox theology interprets Jesus’ command in Matthew 28:19 as a prescriptive liturgical formula. Because Jesus explicitly commanded the use of the three titles, the church has historically maintained this phrasing.\n*   **The Didache:** Early church documents, such as the *Didache* (late first/early second century), instruct believers to baptize using the Matthew 28:19 formula (\"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\"), establishing this as standard practice immediately following the Apostolic age.\n*   **Relation to Acts:** Orthodox theologians do not view the narratives in Acts as a contradiction to Matthew. Instead, they view the phrase \"in the name of Jesus\" in Acts as a statement of **authority** and **allegiance**, rather than a rigid liturgical script.\n\n### 3. What Does Scripture Teach? Harmonizing the Texts\nThe theological tension lies in reconciling the command of Jesus in Matthew with the actions of the Apostles in Acts.\n\n**A. The Meaning of \"In the Name Of\"**\nIn biblical Greek (*eis to onoma* or *epi tō onomati*), doing something \"in the name of\" someone usually meant acting by their authority or entering into their ownership—not necessarily reciting a specific phonetic sound.\n*   **Orthodox view:** When Acts says believers were baptized \"in the name of Jesus,\" it distinguishes Christian baptism from Jewish proselyte baptism or the baptism of John the Baptist. It meant they were being baptized into the sphere of Christ's authority and lordship. It does not necessarily prove that the Apostles did not *say* the Trinitarian formula while performing the rite.\n*   **Oneness view:** They insist \"in the name of\" is a literal instruction for the spoken formula.\n\n**B. The Context of Acts 19:1-5**\nThis passage is crucial. Paul encounters disciples who had only received \"John's baptism.\" Paul explains that John testified of the one coming after him—Jesus. On hearing this, they were baptized \"in the name of the Lord Jesus.\"\n*   **Analysis:** The text highlights a change in *theology* and *allegiance* (from John’s preparatory message to Jesus’ finished work), not necessarily a debate about liturgical wording. However, Oneness theologians rightly note that the narrative emphasis is entirely on Jesus.\n\n**C. Matthew 28:19**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the only time Jesus explicitly commands a formula for baptism. The use of the definite article before each title in the Greek (*tou Patros kai tou Huiou kai tou Hagiou Pneumatos*) grammatically stresses distinction between the three. Orthodox theology argues that if Jesus intended to be baptized only in his own name, he would not have used this tripartite structure.\n\n### 4. Theological Assessment and Conclusion\n\n**Areas of Departure:**\nThe Oneness insistence on \"Jesus' name only\" baptism results in a significant departure from orthodox Christianity, not merely over words, but over the nature of God.\n1.  **Soteriology (Salvation):** Historic Christianity generally teaches that baptism is a means of grace or an ordinance of obedience, but not that the specific pronunciation of a formula is the mechanism of salvation. Oneness theology often links the specific spoken formula to the remission of sins, making the words themselves a condition for salvation.\n2.  **The Trinity:** By collapsing the Father, Son, and Spirit into the single person of Jesus, Oneness theology revives Modalism, which was rejected by the early church councils (such as Nicaea and Constantinople) as heresy.\n\n**The Scriptural Verdict:**\nScripture presents two realities:\n1.  Jesus commanded baptism in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matt 28:19).\n2.  The primitive church baptized by the authority of Jesus (Acts 2:38).\n\nThe most historically and exegetically consistent view—held by the vast majority of Christian history—is that **Matthew 28:19 provides the liturgical words**, while the **Book of Acts acts provides the theological foundation** (that we are baptized into Christ's death and resurrection).\n\nTherefore, while the Oneness desire to honor the name of Jesus is evident, the claim that Trinitarian baptism is *invalid* is an innovation that contradicts the explicit command of Jesus in Matthew 28 and the consistent practice of the historic Christian church. Orthodox theology affirms that baptism \"in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\" fulfills the requirement to be baptized in the name of Jesus, for it is by His command and authority that the Trinitarian nature of God is revealed.",
