    "expected": "",
    "output": "Short answer: there isn’t a single, universally accepted “final authority” across all Christian traditions. Different communions locate ultimate interpretive authority in different sources, and in practice most Christians trust a combination of Scripture, the church’s teaching, and the Spirit’s work within the believing community.\n\nHere is how the main traditions tend to answer the question, with biblical anchors and practical implications:\n\n1) Roman Catholic position (Scripture + Sacred Tradition + Magisterium)\n- Final authority: The teaching office of the Church (the Magisterium), guided by Sacred Tradition, under the authority of the pope in communion with bishops, interprets Scripture for all the Church.\n- Why this view: Catholics hold that God revealed truth both in Scripture and in the apostolic Tradition; the Magisterium safeguards the correct interpretation so that the Church remains faithful to the apostolic deposit.\n- Ecumenical councils matter: The outcomes of ecumenical councils (e.g., Nicaea, Chalcedon) have high authority within Catholicism and help settle doctrinal questions.\n- Practical effect: Individual believers are to assent to the Church’s official interpretation; private interpretation must be checked against the Church’s teaching and Tradition.\n\n2) Eastern Orthodox position (Scripture + Holy Tradition + Councils)\n- Final authority: The consensus of the Church expressed through Holy Tradition, patristic writings, and ecumenical councils, ultimately safeguarded by bishops in communion with the Church.\n- Why this view: Scripture is esteemed as inspired and authoritative, but it is interpreted within the living Tradition of the Church—the faith handed down through the apostles and Fathers.\n- Councils matter: Ecumenical councils play a decisive role in defining orthodox doctrine; no single pope stands above the whole Church as in Roman Catholicism.\n- Practical effect: Believers interpret Scripture within the life of the Church, guided by liturgy, patristic teaching, and communal discernment.\n\n3) Protestant positions (Scripture as final authority, with varying uses of tradition and councils)\n- Core principle (varying by tradition): Scripture alone (sola Scriptura) is the final authority for faith and practice in many Protestant groups, though not in exactly the same way everywhere.\n- Why this view: The belief that God’s Word is the primary norm, accessible to all believers, helps safeguard against human innovations that depart from the gospel.\n- Role of tradition and councils: Confessions, creeds, and historic councils serve as interpretive aids and guardrails, not as infallible authorities in themselves. Private interpretation is allowed and expected to be tested against Scripture; the community of faith helps discern truth.\n- Practical effect: Final interpretive authority often resides in the community of believers and their pastors within a given denomination or local church, under the Spirit’s guidance and tested by Scripture. Some groups emphasize the strong role of pastoral teaching and seminary scholarship; others emphasize the direct reading by laypeople and congregations.\n\n4) Anglican/via media approach (Scripture + Tradition + Reason)\n- Final authority: There is not a single human office with final say; instead, Scripture, Tradition (as preserved in the Anglican formularies and liturgical life), and Reason together guide interpretation.\n- Practical effect: The church relies on the bishops, liturgy, confessional standards (like the Thirty-Nine Articles), and the gathered wisdom of theologians and laity. Councils matter historically, but there is an emphasis on continuity with the early church and the Reformation settlement.\n\n5) Baptists and many Pentecostal/Charismatic contexts\n- Baptist emphasis: The local church and the priesthood of all believers give significant interpretive authority to the congregation, though this is usually guided by Scripture and mutual accountability.\n- Pentecostal/Charismatic emphasis: The Spirit’s ongoing guidance is vital; interpretation should be tested by Scripture and by communal discernment, with personal prophecy or experience checked against the Bible.\n\nBiblical underpinnings often invoked across traditions\n- 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Timothy 2:15; 2 Peter 1:20-21: Scripture’s own authority and the need for Spirit-led discernment in interpreting it.\n- Acts 15 (the Jerusalem Council): Shows authoritative decision-making in the early church about how to interpret God’s revelation in light of the gospel to the Gentiles.\n- John 16:12-13 and John 14-16: The Spirit’s role in guiding the church into truth.\n- 1 Thessalonians 5:21; 1 John 4:1; Colossians 3:16: Testing and discerning doctrine within the community.\n\nA constructive way to think about final authority\n- Scriptural norm: Scripture is the primary and trustworthy norm for faith and practice.\n- Communal discernment: The reading and interpreting of Scripture happens best within a community—whether that’s the local church, a confessing tradition, or the ecumenical fellowship of churches—so that personal biases do not distort the text.\n- Spirit’s guidance: The Holy Spirit illuminates Scripture for readers, guides the church into truth, and enables faithful disagreement to remain civil and constructive.\n- Guardrails: Doctrines must be tested by the gospel, the person and work of Christ, and the overall biblical witness. When a tradition or council’s interpretation clearly contradicts Scripture, most traditions would say the Scripture has the final say.\n\nSo, who has final authority? The answer depends on the tradition:\n- In Catholic and Orthodox frameworks, final authority resides in the church’s teaching authority and tradition, often institutionalized in the Magisterium or in the ecumenical council and patristic consensus.\n- In most Protestant and Anglican frameworks, final authority is more dispersed: Scripture is primary, with creeds, confessions, and councils providing interpretive guidance, and the Spirit and the believing community playing a key role in discernment.\n- In Baptist and many Pentecostal contexts, final authority is often located in the local church and the individual believer’s reading of Scripture, tempered by accountability to the community and tested by the Holy Spirit.\n\nIf you’re looking for a practical takeaway: treat Scripture as the normative Word of God, study it in the context of the church’s tradition and teaching (where that tradition exists), seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and engage in humble, charitable dialogue with others who interpret the text differently. This posture helps guard against both private whim and rigid institutionalism, while honoring the deep unity and diversity of Christian interpretation across traditions.",

This ecumenical, balanced survey avoids strong progressive reinterpretation and avoids asserting strict conservative doctrinal positions as universally normative, placing it in the moderate range.",
