    "expected": "Original sin is the doctrine that all humanity inherited a sinful nature from Adam's fall. As a result, all people are born with a inclination toward sin and are spiritually separated from God. This doesn't mean infants are guilty of actual sins, but that human nature is corrupted and inclined toward evil apart from God's grace.",
    "output": "**The Doctrine of Original Sin – A Systematic, Biblical Overview**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Core Statement of the Doctrine  \n\n**Original sin** is the teaching that *the first human beings—Adam and Eve—committed a decisive act of disobedience against God (the “Fall”) that corrupted the moral nature of all humanity.* As a result:\n\n1. **Humanity inherits a fallen nature** that is inclined toward sin (a pervasive “sinful propensity” or *concupiscence*).  \n2. **Each person is culpably guilty** before God, not because of any personal act, but because of this inherited condition.  \n3. **Consequences** include spiritual death, alienation from God, and the pervasive presence of sin in the created order.  \n\nThe doctrine holds that this inherited condition is universal (*“all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God”* – Romans 3:23) and that only **divine grace** (through Christ’s atoning work) can restore humanity to a right relationship with God.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Biblical Foundations  \n\n| Scripture | Key Point(s) | How It Relates to Original Sin |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Genesis 2‑3** (the Fall) | Adam and Eve’s disobedient act brings the “curse” on the ground, on themselves, and on the serpent. | Introduces the first human sin that results in a “broken” relationship with God and the world. |\n| **Psalm 51:5** (“I was conceived in sin”) | David reflects a reality of being “in sin” from conception. | Early biblical language that anticipates the notion of inherited sinfulness. |\n| **Jeremiah 31:31‑34** (new covenant) | God promises to write His law on hearts. | Implies a need for internal transformation because humanity’s natural state is insufficient. |\n| **Romans 5:12‑21** | “Sin entered the world through one man… and death through sin… the free gift of grace…” | Directly links Adam’s sin to the universal condition of death and sin for all people. |\n| **1 Corinthians 15:21‑22** | “For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.” | Echoes the corporate judgment stemming from Adam. |\n| **Ephesians 2:1‑3** | “You were dead in your trespasses… following the course of this world…” | Describes the human condition as “dead” (spiritually) before regeneration, indicating a universal fallen state. |\n| **Psalm 58:3** (“the wicked are a troubled people”) & **Psalm 14:1–3** (“The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no God’”) | General observation of pervasive sin in humanity. | Reflects the biblical view that sin is a universal reality. |\n\n*Note*: While the term “original sin” is not a biblical phrase, the **collective biblical witness**—especially in Paul’s epistles—forms the scriptural basis for the doctrine.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Historical Development  \n\n| Period | Key Figures & Contributions | Core Emphases |\n|--------|-----------------------------|---------------|\n| **Patristic Era** (2nd–5th c.) | **Irenaeus**, **Tertullian**, **Origen** (early ideas of inherited corruption) | Emphasis on humanity’s “fallen” state and need for Christ. |\n| **Augustine of Hippo** (354‑430) | Formulated the classic Western formulation: *Original sin is a hereditary defect transmitted from Adam, affecting intellect, will, and inclinations.* | The doctrine becomes central to Western theology; “original sin” as *original guilt* and *original corruption*. |\n| **Eastern Orthodox** (post‑Augustine) | **John Chrysostom**, **Gregory Palamas** | Tend to stress *ancestral sin* (the consequences of the Fall) rather than inherited guilt; focus on death and corruption, not juridical guilt. |\n| **Reformation** (16th c.) | **Martin Luther** and **John Calvin** adopt and refine Augustine’s view—emphasizing total depravity and the necessity of grace. | Systematized in the *five points of Calvinism* (TULIP) and Lutheran confessions. |\n| **Post‑Reformation** (17th‑18th c.) | **Arminianism** (Jacob Arminius) retains original sin but stresses prevenient grace enabling human response. |\n| **Modern** (19th‑21st c.) | Various theological strands (e.g., *Christian existentialism*, *liberal theology*) either reinterpret or down‑play the doctrine, but the core biblical claim remains in orthodox confessions (e.g., the *Westminster Confession*, *Lumen Gentium*). |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Theological Components  \n\n| Component | Description | Scriptural Illustration |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| **Transmission** | The fallen condition is *passed down* from the first parents to all descendants. | Romans 5:12 (“through one man sin entered the world”). |\n| **Depravity (Corruption)** | Human nature is *morally weakened*; the will is inclined to sin. | Ephesians 2:1‑3 (“dead in trespasses”). |\n| **Guilt (Legal Standing)** | Humanity stands *under divine judgment* because of Adam’s sin. | Romans 6:23 (“the wages of sin is death”). |\n| **Universal Scope** | Every human is affected *without exception*. | Romans 3:23 (“all have sinned”). |\n| **Need for Grace** | Redemption is *only possible* through God’s initiative in Christ. | John 1:12‑13 (“born of God”). |\n| **Effect on Creation** | The Fall has broader cosmic consequences (e.g., pain, decay). | Genesis 3:17‑19 (curses on creation). |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Common Misunderstandings  \n\n| Misunderstanding | Clarification |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| **“Original sin = personal sin”** | The doctrine does **not** claim that every individual personally commits Adam’s specific act; rather, we inherit a *corrupt nature* and are thus *liable* before God. |\n| **“We are condemned because God is unfair”** | Scripture presents God’s judgment as *just* because the *nature* of humanity has been altered (Romans 5:12‑19). God’s justice is upheld while also providing *unmerited grace* (Romans 5:20‑21). |\n| **“Original sin is a myth”** | The biblical narrative (Genesis‑Romans) and the New Testament’s treatment of sin’s universality and inheritance clearly support the doctrine. |\n| **“It eliminates free will”** | While *total depravity* (in Reformed theology) emphasizes the severe limitation of the will, most traditions affirm *responsibility* and the possibility of *prevenient grace* enabling moral choice (cf. Arminianism). |\n\n---\n\n### 6. Pastoral & Practical Implications  \n\n1. **Humility Before God** – Recognizing that we are all sinners fosters dependence on Christ’s righteousness rather than self‑confidence.  \n2. **The Need for Baptism** – In many traditions, baptism is seen as the means by which the *bond of the original sin* is broken (Acts 2:38; Romans 6:4).  \n3. **Assurance of Grace** – Because salvation is *not earned* but *granted*, believers can rest in the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement (Ephesians 2:8‑9).  \n4. **Ethical Living** – Knowing our fallen nature motivates vigilance against sin and reliance on the Spirit for sanctification (Galatians 5:16‑17).  \n\n---\n\n### 7. Concise Definition  \n\n> **Original sin** is the biblical doctrine that humanity, by virtue of the first human transgression (the Fall), inherits a corrupted nature and universal culpability before God. This condition renders every person spiritually dead, inclined to sin, and in need of divine grace—fulfilled in Christ’s redemptive work—to be restored to righteousness.  \n\n---\n\n**Key Scriptures to Remember**\n\n- **Genesis 3** – The Fall.  \n- **Romans 5:12‑21** – Adam and Christ contrasted; the spread of sin and the gift of grace.  \n- **Psalm 51:5** – The poetic articulation of inherited sin.  \n- **Ephesians 2:1‑3** – The present state of humanity apart from Christ.  \n- **1 Corinthians 15:21‑22** – The corporate outcome of Adam’s sin and Christ’s resurrection.\n\nThese passages together form the biblical backbone of the doctrine, which has been refined through centuries of theological reflection and remains a cornerstone of orthodox Christian teaching on humanity’s need for salvation.",

            "The response presents original sin as universally guilt-bearing for every person, which aligns with classic Western Augustinian/Calvinist theology but does not accurately reflect Eastern Orthodox teaching, which speaks of ancestral sin and corruption without asserting universal inherited guilt.",
            "The 'Guilt (Legal Standing)' component treats original sin as universal inherited guilt before God. While common in Western confessions, this interpretation is contested by non-Western traditions and can blur important doctrinal distinctions between guilt, corruption, and death across traditions.",
            "The pastoral claim that baptism universally removes original sin (e.g., \"the bond of the original sin\" broken by baptism) oversimplifies differing soteriologies: many Protestant traditions do not view baptism as removing original sin, while Catholic/Orthodox frameworks teach baptism as the rite that cleanses original sin and infuses grace. The statement could be read as implying uniform sacramental efficacy across all traditions.",
            "Some scriptural attributions are nuanced in a way that could mislead readers about the directness of certain links (e.g., using John 1:12‑13 as a primary support for original sin rather than Christ‑birth/child of God language that is not itself original-sin terminology).",

          ],
          "rationale": "The answer is comprehensive, well‑reasoned, and largely aligns with orthodox Western (Augustinian/Calvinist) teaching and common Protestant formulations, with explicit acknowledgment of some Eastern distinctions. However, it leans into a universal inherited guilt framework and a broad baptismal‑removal claim that do not hold uniformly across all historic Christian traditions. These represent the main points where the explanation could misrepresent non‑Western perspectives or overgeneralize sacramental practice."

          "explanation": "The passage presents a mainstream, historically orthodox account of original sin: inherited sinfulness, universal culpability, need for grace, and Christ's atonement. It acknowledges variations among traditions (Eastern Orthodox emphasis on ancestral sin rather than guilt; Reformed emphasis on total depravity; Arminian emphasis on prevenient grace). There are a couple of points that could be refined but are not heretical: (1) The line about baptism 'breaking the bond of original sin' reflects a Catholic/Orthodox sacramental view; many Protestant groups disagree on the effect of baptism; clarifying the denominational stance would improve accuracy. (2) Using Psalm 51:5 as direct proof of inherited guilt involves interpretive debate; many scholars see it as a statement about human sinfulness at birth rather than a juridical claim of inherited guilt. Other than these interpretive nuances, the response does not advocate Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, or other classic heresies."
