Most variants are minor (spelling/word order), but they show that **copying introduced differences**—which affects how someone answers “does the Bible contain any errors?” depending on whether they mean “the original message” or “any existing manuscript/translation.”\n\n## Bottom line\n- If you mean **“Does the Bible, as we have it, ever contain tensions or apparent factual discrepancies?”** many would say **yes** (at least at the level of surface details).\n- If you mean **“Is Scripture fully trustworthy in what it intends to teach (especially about God and salvation)?”** many Christian traditions say **yes**.\n- If you mean **“Is every statement Scripture makes factually error-free in the modern precision sense?”** only some traditions say **yes**, and they do so with careful qualifications about genre, intention, and originals.\n\nIf you tell me your context (e.g., evangelical, Catholic, Orthodox, or more academic) and what kind of “error” you have in mind (history/science/morals/theology), I can answer in a more targeted way and walk through specific passages.",
