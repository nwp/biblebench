    "input": "How do different Christian traditions view the role of church tradition and authority?",
    "expected": "Catholic and Orthodox traditions view church tradition as equally authoritative with Scripture, believing the church's teaching authority (magisterium in Catholicism) reliably interprets both. Protestants hold to 'sola scriptura' - Scripture alone as the final authority, though they value historical creeds and confessions as subordinate standards. Anglicans often take a middle position, valuing tradition and reason alongside Scripture (the 'three-legged stool'). These differences affect views on everything from papal authority to how doctrines develop. Despite differences, all agree Scripture is essential and authoritative.",
    "output": "Christian traditions largely agree that Christ authorizes the Church to teach, worship, and order its life (e.g., through pastors/elders, sacraments, preaching, discipline). The main differences concern **(1) what counts as “Tradition,” (2) how Tradition relates to Scripture, and (3) who has final interpretive authority when disputes arise**.\n\n## Shared convictions across orthodox Christianity\nMost historic Christian traditions affirm:\n- **Scripture is uniquely authoritative** as the inspired, normative witness to God’s revelation in Christ.\n- The Church’s **received faith** is summarized in **early creeds** (e.g., Nicene Creed) and was clarified through **ecumenical councils**, especially on core doctrines like the Trinity and the person of Christ.\n- The Church has real (though differently conceived) authority to **teach, guard doctrine, and order worship**.\n\nWhere they differ is the **scope** and **binding force** of later traditions and the **structure** of authority.\n\n---\n\n## Roman Catholic perspective (Scripture–Tradition–Magisterium)\n**Key idea:** *One deposit of faith*, transmitted in **Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition**, authentically interpreted by the Church’s teaching office.\n\n- **Tradition:** Not merely human customs, but the living transmission of apostolic teaching (e.g., liturgy, doctrinal development, consensus of the Fathers).\n- **Authority structure:** The **Magisterium** (bishops in communion with the pope) has a unique role in providing an authoritative interpretation.\n- **Papal role:** The pope has a primacy; under defined conditions, Catholicism teaches he can speak **infallibly** on faith and morals (not implying he is impeccable or always correct in ordinary statements).\n- **Councils and doctrine:** Ecumenical councils and defined teachings can be binding; doctrine may **develop** in expression while remaining faithful to apostolic substance.\n\n---\n\n## Eastern Orthodox perspective (Holy Tradition and conciliarity)\n**Key idea:** Scripture is within **Holy Tradition**, the Church’s living continuity in the Holy Spirit.\n\n- **Tradition:** A comprehensive reality including Scripture, creeds, councils, liturgy, iconography, and the saints’ witness—understood as the Church’s faithful life over time.\n- **Authority structure:** **Conciliar** (synodal) authority among bishops; emphasis on the consensus of the Church across time (“the mind of the Church”).\n- **Councils:** The first seven ecumenical councils are especially authoritative. Reception by the whole Church is often emphasized as a sign of a council’s ecumenical authority.\n- **Distinctive tone:** Orthodoxy often stresses **continuity and stability** of worship and doctrine, and tends to be cautious about defining beyond what is received.\n\n---\n\n## Oriental Orthodox perspective (ancient Tradition with distinct conciliar reception)\n(Examples: Coptic, Armenian, Syriac, Ethiopian Orthodox)\n- Shares much with Eastern Orthodoxy: **Holy Tradition**, sacramental and liturgical continuity, and strong episcopal authority.\n- Differs historically over the Council of Chalcedon (451), while remaining committed to orthodox confession of Christ’s true divinity and true humanity (with distinct theological language).\n- Authority is rooted in Scripture within the Church’s ancient received life, councils, and fathers (with a different set of councils emphasized).\n\n---\n\n## Anglican / Episcopal perspective (Scripture primary, tradition valued)\nAnglicanism is diverse, but a classic framing is:\n\n- **Scripture:** The **primary** authority for salvation and doctrine.\n- **Tradition:** Important for interpreting Scripture, shaping worship, and maintaining continuity with the historic Church.\n- **Reason:** Often highlighted as a tool for faithful understanding and application (commonly associated with the “three-legged stool,” though Anglicans nuance how it functions).\n- **Authority structure:** **Episcopal** (bishops), with authority also vested in synods/conventions; doctrine is often expressed through prayer-book worship and historic formularies rather than frequent dogmatic definitions.\n- **Range within Anglicanism:** “Anglo-Catholic” Anglicans lean more toward Catholic patterns of tradition; “evangelical” Anglicans lean more toward Reformation emphases.\n\n---\n\n## Lutheran perspective (sola Scriptura with strong confessional tradition)\n**Key idea:** Scripture alone is the final norm, but the Church’s confessions are authoritative witnesses insofar as they agree with Scripture.\n\n- **Scripture:** The only **final** authority (norma normans).\n- **Tradition:** Valued as a “ministerial” authority—helpful and often binding within Lutheran churches through the **Lutheran Confessions** (e.g., Book of Concord), but always subordinate to Scripture (norma normata).\n- **Authority structure:** Usually episcopal or synodical forms vary by country; pastoral office is central.\n- **Distinctive emphasis:** Tradition serves the Gospel when it safeguards right teaching about justification, sacraments, and preaching.\n\n---\n\n## Reformed / Presbyterian perspective (sola Scriptura; confessional and elder-led authority)\n**Key idea:** Scripture is the supreme authority; the Church’s standards guide interpretation but are corrigible.\n\n- **Scripture:** Final authority for faith and practice.\n- **Tradition:** Respected as a historical guide and expressed in **confessions/catechisms** (e.g., Westminster Standards, Three Forms of Unity).

At their best, all aim to serve the same end: the Church’s faithful confession of the Triune God and the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nIf you tell me which traditions you’re most interested in (e.g., Catholic vs. Reformed, Orthodox vs. Anglican), I can compare them on a specific question like councils, creeds, papal primacy, or how doctrinal development works.",

            "The 'Shared convictions' section claims 'Scripture is uniquely authoritative' across historic Christian traditions. This is inaccurate for Catholic and Eastern Orthodox theology, which hold Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition as mutually authoritative and inseparable parts of one deposit of faith. Scripture is not treated as the sole or universally 'unique' authority in those traditions; Tradition and the Magisterium (Catholic) or conciliarity (Orthodox) are essential authorities alongside Scripture."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is otherwise thorough and nuanced, accurately outlining the major positions among the traditions. The primary doctrinal inaccuracy lies in the shared-convictions claim that Scripture is 'uniquely authoritative' for most historic traditions. Catholic and Orthodox theology do not grant Scripture exclusive authority; they root authority in both Scripture and Tradition (and in Catholics, the Magisterium). This misrepresents key orthodox positions and affects the overall doctrinal soundness. The rest of the material is generally accurate and nuanced, but the central misstatement undermines biblical grounding and doctrinal soundness."
