    "output": "The primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount, as described in Matthew 5:1-2, 7:28-29, was **a large gathering of Jewish people from various regions, specifically identified as \"the crowds\" (οἱ ὄχλοι - *hoi ochloi*) who followed Jesus.**\n\nHere are the essential facts and key information:\n\n1.  **The Textual Evidence (Matthew 5-7):**\n    *   Matthew 4:23-25 explicitly states that Jesus' fame spread throughout Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and \"beyond the Jordan.\" People from all these regions \"followed him.\"\n    *   Matthew 5:1 states: \"Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them.\" (NIV).\n    *   Matthew 5:2 clarifies: \"He opened his mouth and began to teach *them*\" (the crowds mentioned in v.1, distinct from but including the disciples who came to him).\n    *   The sermon concludes: \"When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching...\" (Matt 7:28-29 NIV). The amazement is attributed to \"the crowds.\"\n\n2.  **Composition of the Audience:**\n    *   **Disciples:** The text explicitly mentions the disciples being present and listening (Matt 5:1, 7:28). They were part of the audience, but the sermon is addressed to the larger gathering.\n    *   **The Multitude (\"Crowds\"):** The primary focus is on the vast number of people (\"crowds,\" \"multitudes\") who had gathered to see Jesus, hear him, and be healed (Matt 4:25, 5:1, 7:28). This included:\n        *   People from **Galilee** (Jesus' home region).\n        *   People from **Judea** (including Jerusalem, the religious center).\n        *   People from **\"Beyond the Jordan\"** (the region east of the Jordan River, also known as Perea).\n        *   People from the **\"Decapolis\"** (a group of ten predominantly Gentile cities southeast of the Sea of Galilee). While the Decapolis had Gentile populations, Jewish people also lived there, and many in the crowd would have been Jewish pilgrims or residents.\n\n3.  **Nature of the Audience:**\n    *   **Predominantly Jewish:** The context (Jewish regions, the teaching content referencing the Law and prophets, the Jewish expectations Jesus addresses) strongly indicates the audience was overwhelmingly Jewish. The mention of the Decapolis simply shows the geographical breadth of the Jewish populace drawn to Jesus, not necessarily a large Gentile contingent *in this specific crowd*.\n    *   **Mixed Background:** While Jewish, the crowd represented a cross-section of Jewish society from different regions (urban and rural), social strata (including the poor, sick, and outcasts mentioned in Matt 4:23-25), and levels of commitment (casual observers, the curious, the hopeful, and dedicated followers like the disciples).\n\n4.  **Scholarly Perspective:**\n    *   **Traditional/Majority View:** The primary audience is clearly identified in the narrative as the large crowds of Jewish people who followed Jesus from various regions. The disciples are present as part of this audience but are not the *exclusive* recipients at this moment.\n    *   **Alternative Perspectives (Minority):** Some scholars debate whether the sermon was delivered to the disciples alone in a more private setting, suggesting the \"crowds\" in Matthew might be a later literary construct. However, the text itself presents the audience as the gathered multitudes. Others might emphasize the long-term significance for the Church, but the narrative context places the immediate audience firmly within the Jewish populace of 1st-century Palestine.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount was **the large Jewish crowds** who had gathered around Jesus on the mountainside, drawn from various regions of Galilee, Judea, Perea, and the Decapolis. While the disciples were present and listening, the sermon itself is directed at and received by these multitudes. This diverse gathering represented a significant cross-section of the Jewish population of that era.",

          "rationale": "The LLM accurately reflects the biblical text: Matthew 5:1 shows Jesus seeing the crowds and beginning to teach them, with disciples among those present; Matthew 7:28-29 notes the crowds’ reaction. The sermon is thus given to a large gathering described as “the crowds,” while the disciples are present and receiving the teaching (Mt 5:1-2; 7:28-29). The answer correctly cites the geographic breadth (Galilee, Judea, beyond the Jordan, Decapolis) and acknowledges that the crowd was predominantly Jewish, with some Gentile presence possible in Decapolis. It also correctly notes the scholarly nuance that some scholars debate whether the sermon was delivered primarily to the disciples in a more private setting, while the text itself presents the crowds as the audience. The response directly addresses the question and provides a balanced view without overclaiming. Potential caveat (not a factual error): the phrase “primary audience” can be debated in scholarly literature, but the answer appropriately presents the majority reading and a minority perspective. "
