The LLM correctly identifies both groups and notes that the core audience receiving detailed instruction are the disciples (discussed as the primary recipients), while the general crowd listens. This aligns with standard exegesis that the sermon is addressed primarily to the disciples, yet delivered in the hearing of the broader crowd. The claims are grounded in scripture (Matt 5:1-2; 4:23-25) and consistent with historic Christian orthodoxy, without introducing doctrinal errors. The nuance of differentiated reception (core disciples vs. listening crowd) is appropriately captured.)"
