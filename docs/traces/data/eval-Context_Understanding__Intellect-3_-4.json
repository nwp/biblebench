    "output": "The primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount, as described in Matthew 5-7 (and briefly in Luke 6:20-49), was **Jesus' disciples**, but it was delivered in the presence of a **large crowd** from various regions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evidence and scholarly understanding:\n\n1.  **The Explicit Text (Matthew 5:1-2):**\n    *   \"Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them...\"\n    *   This clearly identifies the disciples as the direct recipients (\"teach **them**\") of the sermon.\n\n2.  **The Setting (Matthew 4:25, 5:1, 7:28-29):**\n    *   Matthew 4:25 states that large crowds followed Jesus from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and \"from beyond the Jordan.\" This sets the stage for the sermon.\n    *   Matthew 5:1 explicitly mentions Jesus seeing the crowds before going up the mountain.\n    *   Matthew 7:28-29 confirms that when Jesus finished, \"the crowds were astonished at his teaching.\" This indicates the crowds were present and heard the sermon, even if it was primarily addressed to the disciples.\n\n3.  **The Nature of the Sermon:**\n    *   The content is profoundly challenging and sets a high ethical standard (e.g., the Beatitudes, radical commands like loving enemies, turning the other cheek). This type of teaching is characteristic of instruction given to those already committed to following a teacher, not a general evangelistic appeal to the uncommitted masses.\n    *   It addresses themes central to discipleship: the nature of true righteousness exceeding that of the scribes and Pharisees, the cost of following Jesus, the relationship between faith and works, prayer, fasting, wealth, anxiety, judging others, and the \"narrow gate.\" These are topics directly relevant to those seeking to live as Jesus' followers.\n\n4.  **Scholarly Consensus:**\n    *   The majority view among scholars (both evangelical and critical) is that the Sermon was primarily addressed to the disciples. The structure of Matthew's narrative (crowds present -> Jesus addresses disciples) strongly supports this.\n    *   The presence of the crowds is acknowledged, but they are understood as overhearing the instruction given to the core group of followers. The astonishment of the crowds at the end underscores this dynamic.\n\n5.  **Alternative Perspective (Minority View):**\n    *   A small minority of scholars (often those questioning the historicity of the Sermon as a single event) suggest it might have been a compilation of sayings directed more broadly to the crowds or the church community Matthew was writing for. However, the narrative context within Matthew strongly favors the disciples as the primary audience.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n*   **Primary Audience:** Jesus' disciples (the core group of followers).\n*   **Secondary Audience:** A large, diverse crowd from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, and surrounding areas who were present and overheard the teaching.\n*   **Author's Purpose (Matthew):** Matthew likely presents this sermon as foundational teaching for his community (a Jewish-Christian audience), emphasizing Jesus' authority and the nature of true righteousness required of his followers. The disciples as the primary audience serves this purpose perfectly.\n\nTherefore, while the crowds witnessed the event, the Sermon on the Mount is best understood as Jesus' foundational instruction to his inner circle of followers – the disciples – setting the ethical and spiritual standard for those who would follow him.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns with the biblical text and mainstream scholarly synthesis on the Sermon on the Mount. Factual accuracy: - Matthew 5:1-2 explicitly identifies the disciples as the ones Jesus teaches, and the LLM cites this. - Matthew 4:25 establishes that large crowds were following Jesus from various regions, and Matthew 5:1 and 7:28-29 indicate the crowds’ presence and reaction. - The content of the Sermon ( Beatitudes, radical teachings on righteousness, etc.) is accurately characterized as geared toward discipleship. - Luke 6:20-49 is correctly mentioned as a parallel (the Sermon on the Plain), noting a related but distinct pericope. - The minority view acknowledging a broader-or-community-oriented reception is also accurately noted, though it is rightly labeled as a smaller minority. - The inferred purpose in Matthew (for a Jewish-Christian audience) and the framing of the Sermon as foundational for Jesus’ followers are standard scholarly positions. Nuance: The response acknowledges scholarly debate and presents a balanced picture: primary audience = disciples; crowds overheard as secondary; some scholars contest the unity/historicity of a single “sermon,” though this does not undermine the central claim. Relevance: The answer directly addresses the question and preserves key textual evidence and scholarly context without venturing into theological interpretation beyond historical-contextual framing. Overall, the LLM provides a thorough, accurate, and appropriately nuanced evaluation of the Sermon’s primary audience."
