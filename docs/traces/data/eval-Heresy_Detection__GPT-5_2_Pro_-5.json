    "expected": "This is Gnosticism, an ancient heresy. It contradicts Christianity in multiple ways: Christianity teaches salvation through faith in Christ's public work (not secret knowledge), affirms the goodness of God's material creation (Genesis 1), and proclaims resurrection of the body (not escape from physicality). Gnosticism was explicitly condemned by early church fathers and the New Testament writings (especially 1 John and Colossians).",
    "output": "This is **not orthodox Christian teaching**; it closely matches **ancient Gnosticism**, a major **early Christian heresy** (2nd century and following), and it was rejected by the church’s bishops, creeds, and theologians (e.g., Irenaeus in *Against Heresies*).\n\n## Why it’s heretical\n\n### 1) “Salvation comes through secret spiritual knowledge”\nOrthodox Christianity teaches that salvation is **publicly proclaimed** in the gospel and received by **grace through faith in Christ**, not by access to hidden “esoteric” knowledge reserved for an elite.\n\n- The apostles preach an open message for “all nations,” not a secret system for insiders (cf. Matthew 28:19–20).\n- Paul explicitly rejects “secret” elitist spirituality as a basis for salvation (cf. Colossians 2:8–23).\n- The historic church summarized the saving message in public “rules of faith” and later creeds precisely to oppose “secret” reinterpretations.\n\nGnosticism typically replaces **trust in Christ** with **gnōsis** (hidden knowledge) as the means of redemption.\n\n### 2) “Matter is evil”\nOrthodox Christianity rejects the claim that the material world is evil by nature. Scripture teaches:\n\n- God created the world and called it **good** (Genesis 1).\n- Evil is not “matter,” but **sin and rebellion** within God’s good creation.\n- Christians affirm “the maker of heaven and earth” (Apostles’ Creed)—a direct contradiction of Gnostic dualism.\n\nGnostic systems often depict the material world as a prison and sometimes portray the creator of the material order as inferior or hostile—ideas incompatible with biblical monotheism.\n\n### 3) “Salvation is escape from the material world”\nChristian salvation is not escape from creation but **redemption and renewal** of creation.\n\nKey orthodox beliefs that contradict this:\n- **The Incarnation:** The Son of God truly became flesh (John 1:14). If matter were intrinsically evil, the Incarnation becomes unthinkable or is reduced to an illusion (a related heresy called **Docetism**).\n- **Bodily Resurrection:** Jesus rose bodily, and Christians hope for the resurrection of the body (1 Corinthians 15).  \n- **New Creation:** The biblical hope is a renewed heavens and earth, not abandonment of the physical realm (Romans 8:18–25; Revelation 21).\n\n## Conclusion\nThe statement describes **Gnostic/dualistic theology**, not Christianity. Orthodox Christian doctrine teaches salvation through **Christ’s death and resurrection**, received by **grace through faith**, within God’s **good creation** that will be **redeemed**, not discarded.",

It accurately asserts that orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith in the public gospel of Jesus Christ, not through secret knowledge; it affirms the goodness of material creation (Genesis 1) and the bodily resurrection and eschatological renewal of creation (John 1:14; 1 Corinthians 15; Romans 8; Revelation 21). It explicitly contrasts Gnostic dualism with biblical anthropology (incarnation) and soteriology. It cites appropriate scriptural touchpoints (e.g., Matthew 28:19–20, Colossians 2:8–23) and notes early church condemnation (Irenaeus) though it could broaden to mention broader patristic and creedal condemnations. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced, with no significant theological errors.)"
