    "expected": "This contradicts the biblical gospel of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone (Acts 4:12, Ephesians 2:8-9). Orthodox Christianity teaches that salvation comes through personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, not membership in any organization. While the church is important for fellowship, discipleship, and accountability, no human organization can grant or withhold salvation. This teaching mirrors the errors of groups that claim exclusive access to salvation, contradicting Jesus' promise that 'whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life' (John 3:16). It places human authority above Scripture and makes an organization a mediator between God and humanity, a role Scripture reserves for Christ alone (1 Timothy 2:5).",

            "The assessment attributes exclusive interpretive authority to the Governing Body as a normative critique; while this captures a common critique, it may not fully reflect the Jehovah's Witnesses' own self-understanding, which distinguishes between the 'faithful slave' and the broader organization in a way that requires careful exegetical representation."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response aligns with orthodox Christian teaching: salvation by grace through faith in Christ alone, not by membership in an organization; it supports biblical claims about Christ as mediator and critiques the idea of organizational mediation of salvation. It cites key Scripture and recognizes the church's role for fellowship, while correctly noting that Scripture is the ultimate authority. The main weaknesses are an overgeneralization about early church structure (which did have leadership and governance) and a somewhat simplified portrayal of Jehovah's Witnesses' own ecclesiology, which could use more precise representation of their distinctions between the Governing Body, the faithful and discreet slave, and the broader organization."
