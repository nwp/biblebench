    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "My dear friend, first and foremost, I want you to know that my heart breaks with yours. The loss of a child is an unimaginable sorrow, a wound that cuts to the very core of who we are as parents. I'm so sorry for your pain, and I don't pretend to have easy answers or quick fixes. It's okay to grieve deeply—God Himself grieves with us. Let's sit with this together for a moment, and I'll do my best to offer some biblical wisdom, not as pat answers, but as a fellow traveler in this broken world.\n\nYou're right to question those well-meaning but often hurtful platitudes like \"it's God's will\" or \"everything happens for a reason.\" They can feel like salt in an open wound, especially when they seem to paint God as distant or cruel. Let's unpack this biblically, with both truth and tenderness.\n\n### God's Love and the Reality of a Broken World\nThe Bible affirms that God is loving—profoundly so. Scripture tells us that \"God is love\" (1 John 4:8), and He demonstrated that love by sending His own Son, Jesus, to suffer and die for us (John 3:16; Romans 5:8). But we live in a world fractured by sin and death, a consequence of humanity's fall (Genesis 3; Romans 5:12). Tragedies like car accidents aren't part of God's original design; they're intruders in His good creation. God doesn't \"will\" evil in the sense of causing or delighting in it. The prophet Jeremiah reminds us that God's heart is not to afflict us willingly: \"For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone\" (Lamentations 3:33, NIV).\n\nThat said, God is sovereign—He reigns over all things (Psalm 103:19). Yet His sovereignty doesn't mean He micromanages every tragedy as if it were His direct plan. Sometimes, suffering comes from human choices (like reckless driving), natural consequences, or the general brokenness of the world. We see this in the story of Job, a man who lost everything, including his children, through no fault of his own. Job wrestled with God, crying out, \"Why?\" (Job 3:11), and God didn't condemn him for it. Instead, God met Job in his pain, reminding him of His vast wisdom and care, even when answers feel elusive (Job 38–42). Your questions aren't a sign of weak faith; they're an honest lament, and the Psalms are full of them (e.g., Psalm 13:1–2: \"How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever?\").\n\n### Does Everything Happen for a Reason?\nAs for \"everything happens for a reason,\" the Bible does promise that God can redeem even the darkest moments for good. Romans 8:28 assures us: \"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.\" But notice it doesn't say God causes all things—rather, He works in and through them. Your child's death isn't \"good\" in itself; it's a profound evil. Yet God, in His mercy, can bring beauty from ashes (Isaiah 61:3), perhaps through deepened compassion in you, stronger bonds in your community, or even eternal hope that points others to Christ. We may not see the full \"reason\" this side of heaven, and that's okay—it's not our job to figure it all out, but to trust the One who holds it all.\n\nThink of Jesus at the tomb of His friend Lazarus (John 11). Even knowing He would raise Lazarus, Jesus wept. He entered fully into human grief, showing us that God isn't aloof; He's with us in the valley of the shadow of death (Psalm 23:4). Your child's death grieves God's heart too—He hates death, calling it the last enemy to be destroyed (1 Corinthians 15:26).\n\n### Practical Steps Forward\nGrief like this isn't linear; it's a journey, and God walks it with you. Here are a few practical, Scripture-grounded steps to consider:\n- **Lament Honestly**: Pour out your heart to God, as David did in the Psalms. Write down your questions, anger, or confusion—He can handle it. Consider joining a grief support group, like GriefShare, where you can share with others who've walked this road.\n- **Lean on Community**: Don't isolate yourself. Ecclesiastes 4:9–10 reminds us that two are better than one in times of stumbling. Reach out to trusted friends, your church family, or a counselor who can help you process this without judgment.\n- **Cling to Hope**: Your child is safe in God's presence if they knew Him, or even if not, we entrust them to His perfect justice and mercy (Romans 14:8). And one day, God will wipe away every tear, and death will be no more (Revelation 21:4). Until then, hold onto Jesus, who conquered death through His resurrection.\n- **Seek God's Presence Daily**: Start with simple prayers or reading comforting Scriptures like Psalm 34:18: \"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.\"\n\nFriend, you're not alone in this. God loves you fiercely, even in your doubt, and He's not offended by your questions—He's drawing near to you. If you'd like, we can pray together right now: *Heavenly Father, wrap Your arms around this grieving parent. Comfort them in their sorrow, remind them of Your unchanging love, and give them strength for each day. Help them see glimpses of Your goodness amid the pain, and sustain them until the day all is made new. In Jesus' name, Amen.*\n\nI'm here if you want to talk more—about your child, your faith, or anything else. May God's peace, which surpasses understanding, guard your heart (Philippians 4:7).",

          "rationale": "The response is pastorally rich and theologically solid overall. It rightly affirms Gods love, distinguishes between Gods sovereignty and His not actively willing evil, and holds up biblical grounds for lament, suffering within a fallen world, and redemptive purposes (Romans 8:28; John 11; 1 Cor 15:26; Rev 21:4). It grounds its claims in Scripture (e.g., John 3:16; Romans 5:8; Psalm 34:18; Job 38–42; Lamentations 3:33; Psalm 23:4), and it offers compassionate, practical guidance. Nuance is captured in its distinction between what God wills vs. what He allows, and in acknowledging mystery about Gods purposes in tragedy. Minor caveats concern careful wording around a deceased childs salvation and a precise use of Romans 14:8; adjusting those phrasings would sharpen biblical precision without changing the overall pastoral integrity."
