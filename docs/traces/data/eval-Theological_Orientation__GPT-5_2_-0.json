    "expected": "",
    "output": "“Inspired” is a theological claim about *origin and authority*: Scripture is given by God through human authors so that what it teaches is God’s word for the church.\n\n## 1) What Christians mean by “inspired”\nTwo classic biblical texts frame the doctrine:\n\n- **2 Timothy 3:16**: “All Scripture is *God-breathed* (theopneustos) and profitable…”  \n  The emphasis is not on a mechanism (dictation vs. not) but on Scripture’s divine source and its function in forming God’s people.\n\n- **2 Peter 1:20–21**: “No prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation… but men spoke from God as they were *carried along* by the Holy Spirit.”  \n  The image suggests genuine divine superintendence alongside genuine human speech.\n\nHistorically, most Christians also stress that inspiration is **not** usually understood as mechanical dictation. The Bible shows diverse styles, vocabularies, genres, and perspectives (e.g., Luke’s preface describing research, *Luke 1:1–4*; Paul’s occasional letters; poetic psalms; apocalyptic imagery).\n\nSo inspiration typically includes two affirmations held across many traditions:\n\n1) **God is the primary author** (Scripture is God’s word in a real sense).  \n2) **Human authors are real authors** (with culture, language, genre, intent).\n\n## 2) Does “inspired” imply “without error”? Different Christian answers\nChristians agree Scripture is authoritative, but they differ on how to describe its truthfulness and the scope of “error.”\n\n### A) Full (or “plenary/verbal”) inerrancy (common in conservative Evangelical Protestantism)\nThis view holds that because God is truthful, Scripture—properly interpreted—is **without error in all that it affirms**, including history and facts, at least in the **original writings** (“autographs”). Key points:\n\n- **“In all it affirms”** matters: poetry, metaphor, approximation, and phenomenological language (“the sun rises”) are not treated as errors because they are not intending to teach astronomy.\n- It often distinguishes **inerrancy of the autographs** from the reality that copyists introduced mistakes. These are addressed through **textual criticism** (comparing manuscripts to recover the earliest attainable text).  \n- Many inerrantists admit ordinary features of human communication: rounding numbers, summarizing speeches, using sources, differing chronological arrangements, etc., without calling these “errors.”\n\nA representative modern articulation is the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978)**.\n\n### B) Infallibility focused on faith and salvation (common in Catholic and Orthodox theology, and in many mainline Protestants)\nHere “inspired” is paired with the claim that Scripture is **reliably true for what God intends it to teach for our salvation and faithful living**, without necessarily demanding modern precision in every ancillary detail.\n\n- **Roman Catholic teaching (Vatican II, *Dei Verbum* 11)** says Scripture “teaches… faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings *for the sake of our salvation*.”  \n  Catholics may differ internally on how far that extends (some are close to full inerrancy; others allow that certain historical/scientific incidental claims may reflect ancient assumptions).\n- **Eastern Orthodox** approaches often emphasize Scripture’s role within **Holy Tradition** and the Church’s interpretive life. The stress is on Scripture’s trustworthiness for revealing God and forming holiness, with less focus on defining inerrancy in modern propositional terms.\n\nThis approach typically says: the Bible is not trying to be a modern textbook of science or a fully harmonized chronicle, and some apparent “discrepancies” may arise from genre, ancient historiography, or the Bible’s pastoral/theological aims.\n\n### C) “Limited inerrancy” / “limited errorlessness”\nSome theologians affirm that Scripture is completely true in matters of faith and morals, but **may contain errors** in incidental historical or scientific details because inspiration does not override all human limitations. They’ll point to:\n\n- The Bible’s use of ancient cosmological imagery (e.g., “firmament,” “pillars of the earth”) as *phenomenological or poetic*, yet sometimes presented in ways that sound factual to modern ears.\n- Differences in parallel accounts (e.g., details in Kings/Chronicles or the Gospel narratives) as evidence of ordinary historical reporting and theological shaping.\n\nCritics of this view worry it can become hard to draw principled boundaries around what counts as “incidental” vs. “theological,” potentially weakening trust in Scripture.\n\n### D) Neo-orthodox / “Scripture becomes the word of God”\nAssociated with Karl Barth and others: the Bible is a human witness that God uses to speak. Inspiration is located especially in God’s *act* of speaking through Scripture, not necessarily in error-free propositions. Many who adopt this view are comfortable acknowledging more historical difficulties in the text while still confessing Scripture’s unique authority as a means by which God addresses us.\n\n## 3) What about historical/scientific statements?\nA key issue is **what the text intends to affirm** and **how genre works**.\n\n- Biblical authors often describe the world as it appears (phenomenological language), or use poetic/cosmological imagery for theological purposes.  \n- Ancient historiography did not operate with modern expectations about quotation, chronology, or exhaustive detail. Ancient authors could arrange events thematically or craft speeches to convey the substance of what was said.\n\nThus, even many who defend inerrancy will say: not every statement is meant as technical description. Conversely, those who allow possible “errors” will often say: Scripture’s purpose is not undermined if an ancient incidental detail reflects the limitations of its human authors.\n\n## 4) What about manuscript transmission—can there be copying errors?\nHere there is wide agreement across most Christian traditions:\n\n- **We do not possess the original manuscripts.** We possess many thousands of copies, and they include **variants** (spelling, word order, occasional omitted lines, etc.).\n- Most variants are minor; a small number are meaningful; very few are both meaningful and hard to resolve.  \n- Through **textual criticism**, scholars can usually determine the earliest reading with high confidence.\n\nSo even among those who affirm “inerrancy,” it is typically applied to the **original text**, while acknowledging **errors in transmission** occurred. The theological claim is then that God has nevertheless preserved Scripture sufficiently for the church’s faith and practice.\n\n## 5) A balanced summary\n- To call the Bible “inspired” is to confess that God authoritatively speaks through these writings by the Holy Spirit, using real human authors in real historical contexts.  \n- Christians disagree on whether this requires **complete factual inerrancy in every domain** or whether Scripture is **without error in what God intends to teach for salvation**, allowing that some incidental historical/scientific details may reflect ancient contexts.  \n- Nearly all Christians acknowledge **manuscript transmission includes variants**, though most also affirm that the text is reliably preserved and that core Christian doctrine does not depend on a disputed variant.\n\nIf you want, I can illustrate how different traditions would handle a specific “problem passage” (e.g., Gospel differences in the resurrection accounts, numbers in Kings vs. Chronicles, Genesis and cosmology) and show how the interpretive principles work in practice.",
