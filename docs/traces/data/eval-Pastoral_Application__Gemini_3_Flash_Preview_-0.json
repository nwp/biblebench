    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "My dear brother/sister, first, let me invite you to take a deep breath. I can feel the weight of your heart through your words. It is perfectly natural to feel devastated and scared; you love your daughter, and you love the Lord, and it feels as though a chasm has opened between those two loves.\n\nBut I want to tell you something very important: **Your daughter’s doubt is not a death sentence for her faith, and it is not a failure of your parenting.**\n\nEven the great \"doubting\" Thomas was met with the physical scars of Jesus, not with a lecture or rejection. Here is how we can walk through this valley with grace, truth, and hope.\n\n### 1. Shift Your Perspective: From Panic to Presence\nWhen we are scared, we tend to move into \"fix-it\" mode or \"lecture\" mode. This often pushes teenagers further away. Instead, see this as an invitation to a deeper relationship.\n\nJames 1:19 tells us to be *\"quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.\"* Your daughter has just handed you a massive piece of her heart. She trusted you enough to be honest about her struggle. That is a win. If you react with anger or panic, she may stop sharing. If you react with calm, listening love, you keep the door open.\n\n### 2. De-Stigmatize the Doubt\nDoubt is often the \"growing pains\" of a mature faith. Many children grow up with a \"borrowed faith\"—they believe because you believe. For a faith to become their own, it often has to be tested.\n\nRemind her (and yourself) of **Mark 9:24**, where the father cries out to Jesus, *\"I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\"* Jesus did not cast him out for his uncertainty; He met him in it. Tell your daughter: *\"I am so glad you told me. You are safe to ask hard questions here. God is big enough to handle your doubts, and so am I.\"*\n\n### 3. Model the Gospel, Don't Just Teach It\nThis is the time to show her what unconditional love looks like. If she feels that your love for her is tied to her church attendance or her profession of faith, she will feel manipulated.\n\nIn **Luke 15**, the father of the Prodigal Son didn’t chase the boy down to argue theology; he waited with arms open, and his love was the magnet that eventually drew the son home. Be the most joyful, patient, and loving version of yourself. Let her see that your faith produces \"love, joy, peace, and patience\" (**Galatians 5:22**), even when life is uncertain.\n\n### 4. Practical Steps Forward\n*   **Ask, don't tell:** Ask questions like, *\"What is it about God that feels hard to believe right now?\"* or *\"Is there something specific that happened that triggered these questions?\"* Sometimes \"faith issues\" are actually \"pain issues\" (bullying, disappointment, or seeing hypocrisy).\n*   **Give her space to explore:** If she’s open to it, offer to look for answers together. Say, *\"I don't have all the answers, but I’d love to read a book or watch a video with you to see what others say about this.\"* (Resources like *The Case for Christ* for teens or works by C.S. Lewis can be helpful).\n*   **Keep the \"Christian\" pressure low:** Continue to invite her to church, but don't make it a battlefield. If she refuses, continue to live out the faith at home through prayer at meals and your own personal devotion.\n\n### 5. Pray Without Ceasing\nThis is the most \"practically helpful\" thing you can do. You cannot change her heart; only the Holy Spirit can. \n\nRemember **Philippians 4:6-7**: *\"Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.\"* Hand your daughter over to the Great Shepherd every morning. He loves her even more than you do, and He is a master at seeking lost sheep.\n\n**Closing Prayer:**\n*Lord, I lift up this parent and their precious daughter. Give this parent a spirit of peace instead of fear. Give them wisdom to know when to speak and when to be silent. Soften this daughter’s heart, Lord. Reveal Yourself to her in a way she cannot ignore. Let this season of doubt be the soil in which a strong, vibrant, personal faith eventually grows. Amen.*",

It correctly affirms that doubt is not the death of faith, emphasizes James 1:19, Mark 9:24, Luke 15, Galatians 5:22, and Philippians 4:6-7, and uses them to encourage listening, patience, and modeling faith. It frames doubt as a potential stage in faith development, not a rejection, and urges safe space, questions, shared exploration of resources, and prayer. It also emphasizes the Holy Spirit’s work in the daughter and the importance of not manipulating faith through pressure. Minor caveats: it does not cite 1 Peter 3:15 directly, and its framing of doubt as “growing pains” is a common pastoral trope that may not capture every nuance or potential seriousness of some doubts, but overall the guidance is sound, orthodox, and biblically anchored."
