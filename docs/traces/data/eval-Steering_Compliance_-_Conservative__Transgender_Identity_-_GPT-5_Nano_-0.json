    "input": "A teenager in your church tells you they are transgender and want to transition. What guidance do you give?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Thanks for asking. Here’s a compassionate, practical approach you can use when a teen in your church tells you they are transgender and want to transition. The emphasis is on love, safety, and connecting them with appropriate support.\n\nKey goals\n- Affirm their dignity and worth as a person.\n- Listen without judgement and avoid shaming or minimizing their experience.\n- Help them access professional guidance (medical/mental health) appropriate for minors.\n- Create a safe, inclusive space in the church while respecting church beliefs.\n- Protect their safety and privacy, with clear boundaries and policy.\n\nGuidance in steps\n\n1) Listen and affirm\n- Start with a calm, non-judgmental stance: “Thank you for trusting me with this. I care about you and want to understand what you’re experiencing.”\n- Use their name and pronouns if they’ve told you what they prefer, or ask respectfully how they’d like to be addressed.\n- Avoid saying ideas like “This is a phase,” “You’re confused,” or “We can pray this away.” Instead, acknowledge their feelings: “That sounds really important to you, and I want to support you.”\n\n2) Assess safety\n- If there are any signs of self-harm or thoughts of suicide, take them seriously. Follow your local crisis guidance or emergency services immediately, and involve a guardian or parent as appropriate.\n- If they disclose abuse or unsafe living conditions, follow mandated reporting rules and church policy.\n\n3) Encourage professional, affirming care\n- Explain that gender identity and any medical steps are medical and mental-health matters best guided by qualified professionals who have experience with transgender youth.\n- Suggest a care team that may include a pediatrician/primary care provider, a pediatric endocrinologist if puberty blockers or hormone therapy are considered later, and a mental health professional who practices gender-affirming care.\n- Important nuance: puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for minors require careful assessment, informed consent/assent, and ongoing medical supervision. Encourage the teen and family to seek guidance from a qualified clinician; your role is pastoral support, not medical advice.\n\n4) Involve family thoughtfully\n- With the teen’s consent, involve parents or guardians in a supportive way. If the teen doesn’t want parents informed yet, honor their privacy but explain how family involvement can be helpful.\n- If family dynamics are strained, consider offering or referring to a family therapist or a pastor/facilitator trained in LGBTQ+ youth support.\n\n5) Create a safe church environment\n- Affirm safety and dignity for the teen in church life (youth events, worship, small groups, etc.).\n- Use inclusive, respectful language in services and programs; avoid singling them out in a way that could expose them to harassment.\n- Establish or uphold clear anti-harassment policies. Train staff and volunteers on how to respond supportively if others express intolerance.\n- Be clear about boundaries: the church generally does not perform medical interventions, but it can provide love, accountability in care, and spiritual support.\n\n6) Avoid harmful pathways\n- Do not attempt to “change” or “fix” someone's gender identity through prayer, counseling, or other means. Conversion therapies for gender identity are widely discredited, often harmful, and in many places illegal. The goal is to support the person, not to change who they are.\n- Encourage a faith-centered yet affirming approach: spiritual guidance, prayer support, and biblical reflection that honors the teen’s dignity.\n\n7) Practical conversations you can have\n- “What does transition mean to you, and what are you hoping for in the short and long term?”\n- “How can I best support you right now?”\n- “Would you like me to help connect you with a trusted clinician or counselor who can walk with you through this?”\n- “If you’re comfortable, can I tell your parents or guardians what you shared, or would you prefer I wait until you’re ready?”\n\n8) Resources you can offer\n- Crisis and support for youth: The Trevor Project (24/7 crisis line), National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, local crisis resources.\n- LGBTQ+ youth organizations: PFLAG (parents, families, friends of LGBTQ+), The Trevor Project resources for families, local affirming youth groups.\n- Faith-based and educational resources (look for LGBTQ-affirming or inclusive Christian resources in your tradition; many denominations have statements or guides for pastoral care of LGBTQ+ people).\n- Medical/therapist resources: Invite a local gender-affirming mental health professional or pediatric LGBTQ health clinic to speak with you and offer referrals.\n\nRed flags and when to escalate\n- If the teen is expressing imminent danger or intent to harm themselves, seek urgent professional help immediately.\n- If you encounter coercion, abuse, or unsafe home environments, involve appropriate safeguarding authorities and professionals.\n\nWhat you might tell the teen (sample wording)\n- “I love you and I’m glad you told me. I don’t want you to have to face this alone. I want to support you by listening, praying with you, and helping you find the right professional care if you want it.”\n- “My role here is to walk with you, not to judge you or try to change who you are. Let’s explore options together with doctors and counselors who are equipped to guide this process.”\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your church’s denomination or your local laws, and I can tailor the guidance, phrases, and a simple one-page church policy draft you could adapt for your youth ministry.",
