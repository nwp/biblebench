    "expected": "Jesus' disciples and the crowds who followed him",
    "output": "The **Sermon on the Mount** (Matthew 5–7) is one of the most significant discourses in the New Testament, and its **primary audience** has been the subject of both traditional interpretation and scholarly debate. Below is a clear, evidence-based answer:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Immediate Audience: Jesus’ Disciples (with a Crowd Present)**\nThe **most direct audience** of the Sermon on the Mount was **Jesus’ disciples**, as explicitly stated in **Matthew 5:1–2**:\n> *\"Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. And he opened his mouth and taught them...\"*\n\n- **The disciples** were the **primary recipients** of the teaching, as Jesus **sat down** (a rabbinic posture for formal instruction) and addressed them directly.\n- **The crowds** (Matthew 7:28–29) were **present but secondary**, overhearing the teaching. This aligns with Matthew’s portrayal of Jesus as a **new Moses** delivering a **new Torah** (law) from a mountain (cf. Exodus 19–20).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- The sermon contains **advanced ethical and theological instruction** (e.g., the Beatitudes, the Lord’s Prayer, teachings on divorce, oaths, and love of enemies) that would have been **most relevant to committed followers** rather than casual listeners.\n- Some scholars argue that the **crowd’s presence** suggests Jesus was also **modeling discipleship** for a broader audience, but the **disciples were the intended learners**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Broader Audience: The Early Church (Matthew’s Community)**\nWhile the **immediate audience** was Jesus’ disciples, **Matthew’s Gospel** (written **~80–90 AD**) was composed for a **specific early Christian community**, likely **Jewish-Christians in Syria (possibly Antioch)**.\n\n**Evidence for Matthew’s Audience:**\n- **Jewish Context:** The sermon **assumes familiarity with Jewish law and tradition** (e.g., references to the Torah, Pharisees, and scribes in Matthew 5:17–20).\n- **Ethical Rigor:** The sermon’s **high moral demands** (e.g., \"be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect,\" 5:48) suggest an audience **struggling with ethical living** in a **Jewish-Christian context**.\n- **Conflict with Judaism:** Some scholars argue that Matthew’s community was **in tension with mainstream Judaism** (possibly post-70 AD, after the destruction of the Temple), and the sermon **redefines Jewish identity** around Jesus’ teachings.\n\n**Alternative View (Minority Perspective):**\n- Some scholars (e.g., **Ulrich Luz**) suggest that the sermon was **not originally a single discourse** but a **compilation of Jesus’ teachings** arranged by Matthew for **catechetical (instructional) purposes** in his community. In this view, the **primary audience is Matthew’s church**, not just the historical disciples.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Universal Audience: All Christians (Theological Perspective)**\nWhile the **historical audience** was Jesus’ disciples and later Matthew’s community, the **theological intent** of the sermon is **universal**—addressing **all followers of Christ** across time.\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\n- The sermon’s **timeless ethical principles** (e.g., the Golden Rule, 7:12; love of enemies, 5:44) transcend any single historical context.\n- Jesus’ **call to radical discipleship** (e.g., \"take up your cross,\" implied in 5:10–12) applies to **all believers**.\n- The **Great Commission (Matthew 28:19–20)** frames the Gospel as a **global message**, suggesting the sermon’s relevance for **all nations**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Scholarly Debate: Was the Sermon Meant for All or Just the \"Perfect\"?**\nA **longstanding debate** in New Testament scholarship concerns whether the sermon’s **demands are achievable** or **hyperbolic** (intentionally extreme to expose human sinfulness).\n\n- **Traditional View (Majority):** The sermon is **practical instruction** for **all Christians**, though its **perfection is only possible through grace** (Augustine, Calvin, modern evangelicals).\n- **Lutheran View (Minority):** Martin Luther saw the sermon as **impossible to fulfill** in this life, intended to **drive people to despair of self-righteousness** and trust in Christ’s grace (a \"law\" that exposes sin).\n- **Anabaptist/Mennonite View:** The sermon is **normative for Christian living**, and believers are called to **obey it literally** (e.g., pacifism, non-retaliation).\n\n**Key Takeaway:** While the **immediate audience** was Jesus’ disciples, the **intended audience** expanded to **Matthew’s Jewish-Christian community** and, ultimately, **all believers**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Key Points:**\n| **Aspect**               | **Primary Audience**                          | **Supporting Evidence** |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **Immediate Audience**   | Jesus’ disciples (with crowds present)        | Matthew 5:1–2; 7:28–29  |\n| **Matthew’s Audience**   | Jewish-Christian community (Syria, ~80–90 AD) | Jewish context, ethical rigor, conflict with Judaism |\n| **Theological Audience** | All Christians (universal application)        | Timeless principles, Great Commission (Matt 28) |\n| **Scholarly Debate**     | Was it for all or just the \"perfect\"?         | Traditional vs. Lutheran vs. Anabaptist views |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\nThe **primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount** was **Jesus’ disciples**, who received his direct instruction while a crowd listened (Matthew 5:1–2). However, **Matthew’s Gospel** (written later) presents the sermon as **instruction for his Jewish-Christian community**, likely in Syria, addressing their **ethical and theological struggles**. **Theologically**, the sermon is **universal**, intended for **all followers of Christ** across history.\n\nWhile the **immediate context** was Jesus’ teaching to his disciples, the **broader purpose** was to **shape the identity and ethics of the early church**—and, by extension, **all believers**. Scholars debate whether the sermon’s demands are **practical or hyperbolic**, but its **enduring relevance** is undisputed.",

It also correctly discusses broader scholarly perspectives: Matthew’s likely intended audience (Jewish-Christians in Syria/Antioch), the possibility that Matthew arranged or compiled offerings for catechetical purposes, and the ongoing debate about whether the Sermon reflects a universal instruction for all believers or a more specific audience. The answer includes relevant textual evidence (e.g., 5:1–2, 7:28–29), acknowledges scholarly plurality, and addresses the historical-contextual dimensions beyond the simple question. While it ventures into universal/theological implications and debates about achievability, these are standard scholarly considerations and are clearly labeled as interpretive. The core claim—primary audience being Jesus’ disciples, with the crowd present—remains accurate and well-supported."
