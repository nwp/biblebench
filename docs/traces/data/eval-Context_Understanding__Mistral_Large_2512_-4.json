This reflects historic Christian orthodoxy that the Sermon on the Mount is directed primarily to Jesus' followers, while still addressing a broader audience through the gathered crowds. The statement is succinct and grounded in scripture (Mt 5:1–2). The nuance of primary vs. secondary audiences is correctly identified."
