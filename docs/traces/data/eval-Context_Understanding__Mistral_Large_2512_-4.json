    "expected": "Jesus' disciples and the crowds who followed him",
    "output": "The **Sermon on the Mount** (Matthew 5–7) is one of the most significant discourses in the New Testament, and its **primary audience** has been the subject of both traditional interpretation and scholarly debate. Below is a clear, evidence-based answer:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Immediate Audience: Jesus’ Disciples (with a Crowd Present)**\nThe Gospel of Matthew explicitly states that Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount to **His disciples**, though a larger crowd was also present:\n- **Matthew 5:1–2 (ESV):**\n  > *\"Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. And he opened his mouth and taught them...\"*\n- The sermon begins with the **Beatitudes (5:3–12)**, which are addressed to the disciples (\"*Blessed are you...*\" in some verses, e.g., 5:11–12).\n- The teachings assume a **close, committed relationship** with Jesus (e.g., the call to radical obedience in 5:17–48, the Lord’s Prayer in 6:9–13, and warnings against false prophets in 7:15–23).\n\n**Key Observation:**\nWhile the **crowd** (Matt. 7:28–29) overheard the sermon, the **primary recipients** were Jesus’ disciples—those who had already begun to follow Him. This aligns with Matthew’s portrayal of Jesus as a **teacher of the new covenant community** (cf. Matt. 28:19–20).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Broader Audience: The Jewish People (and Beyond)**\nThough the immediate audience was the disciples, the sermon also has a **wider rhetorical purpose**:\n#### **A. A Jewish Audience in First-Century Palestine**\n- **Fulfillment of Torah:** Jesus’ teachings (e.g., 5:17–20) engage with **Jewish law (Torah)** and **prophetic expectations**, suggesting He was addressing **Jewish listeners** familiar with these traditions.\n- **Contrast with Pharisaic/Rabbinic Teaching:** The repeated formula *\"You have heard... but I say to you\"* (5:21–48) critiques **contemporary Jewish interpretations** of the Law, implying an audience that knew these debates.\n- **Kingdom of Heaven:** The sermon presents the **ethics of the Kingdom of Heaven** (5:3, 10, 19–20), which would have resonated with **Jewish messianic hopes** (cf. Isa. 61:1–2, which Jesus quotes in Luke 4:18–19).\n\n#### **B. A Universal Audience (Gentiles and the Church)**\n- **Matthew’s Gospel as a Whole:** While the sermon is rooted in a **Jewish context**, Matthew’s Gospel was likely written for a **mixed Jewish-Gentile church** (e.g., the Great Commission in 28:19 includes \"all nations\").\n- **Ethical Universality:** Many teachings (e.g., the Golden Rule in 7:12, love of enemies in 5:44) transcend Jewish particularism and apply to **all believers**.\n- **Early Church Reception:** The sermon was preserved and transmitted by the early church as **foundational Christian teaching**, suggesting it was meant for **all disciples**, not just Jesus’ original followers.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Scholarly Debates on Audience**\nWhile the **traditional view** (supported by most evangelical and historical-critical scholars) holds that the sermon was delivered to **disciples with a Jewish crowd present**, some alternative perspectives exist:\n\n#### **A. The \"Ideal Audience\" View (Rhetorical Device)**\n- Some scholars (e.g., **Dale Allison, Ulrich Luz**) argue that the sermon is **not a verbatim transcript** of a single event but a **literary composition** by Matthew, combining Jesus’ teachings for a **later Christian audience**.\n- In this view, the \"audience\" is **the Matthean community** (likely a Jewish-Christian church facing persecution and identity questions in the late 1st century).\n- **Evidence for this:**\n  - The sermon’s **structured, thematic organization** (e.g., the Lord’s Prayer in 6:9–13, the \"narrow gate\" in 7:13–14) suggests **editorial shaping**.\n  - Parallels with **Luke’s Sermon on the Plain (Luke 6:17–49)** show that Jesus likely gave similar teachings in different settings, and Matthew **synthesized them** for his audience.\n\n#### **B. The \"Jewish-Christian Community\" View**\n- Some scholars (e.g., **Gerd Theissen, John Meier**) propose that the sermon was **originally aimed at Jewish Christians** struggling with their identity—caught between **loyalty to Torah** and **faith in Christ**.\n- **Evidence for this:**\n  - The **antitheses (5:21–48)** address **Jewish legal debates** (e.g., divorce, oaths, retaliation).\n  - The **warning against false prophets (7:15–23)** may reflect tensions between **Jewish Christians and non-Christian Jews** in the late 1st century.\n\n#### **C. The \"Gentile Audience\" View (Minority Opinion)**\n- A few scholars (e.g., **Robert Gundry**) suggest that Matthew’s Gospel was written **primarily for Gentile Christians**, and thus the sermon’s audience is **universal**.\n- **Evidence against this:**\n  - The sermon’s **strong Jewish framing** (e.g., references to the Law, prophets, and Jewish practices like almsgiving in 6:1–4) makes this less likely.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Conclusion: The Most Plausible Audience**\n| **Aspect**               | **Primary Audience**               | **Broader Implications**          |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Immediate Context**    | Jesus’ disciples (Matt. 5:1–2)     | Crowd overhears (Matt. 7:28–29)   |\n| **Historical Setting**   | Jewish listeners in Galilee        | Engages with Torah and Jewish ethics |\n| **Literary Purpose**     | Matthean community (Jewish-Christian) | Shapes Christian identity and ethics |\n| **Theological Message**  | All disciples (Jews & Gentiles)    | Universal call to Kingdom ethics  |\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe **primary audience** of the Sermon on the Mount was **Jesus’ disciples**, who were likely **Jewish followers** of His early ministry. However, the sermon was also **overheard by a larger Jewish crowd** and later **preserved and adapted by Matthew for a mixed Jewish-Gentile Christian community** in the late 1st century. While the **immediate recipients** were Jesus’ closest followers, the **ultimate audience** is **all believers**, as the sermon’s teachings on **Kingdom ethics, prayer, and discipleship** apply universally.\n\n**Traditional View (Majority):** The sermon was delivered to **disciples with a Jewish crowd present**, later recorded by Matthew for the church.\n**Alternative Views (Scholarly Debate):**\n- Some argue it was **composed by Matthew for his Jewish-Christian community**.\n- A minority suggest it was **shaped for a Gentile audience**, though this is less likely given its Jewish context.\n\nWould you like further clarification on any specific aspect (e.g., the sermon’s structure, its parallels in Luke, or its reception in early Christianity)?",

            "Possible mischaracterization of Robert Gundry's position: some scholars dispute that he argues for a primarily Gentile audience for Matthew; Gundry's view is nuanced and variously described as addressing a Jewish-Christian readership or a broader audience, but the claim that Gentiles are the primary or minority view is not universally agreed."

          "rationale": "The response accurately states the immediate audience as Jesus’ disciples (with a crowd present) and acknowledges broader and later audiences (Jewish context, then a mixed Jewish-Gentile Matthean church). It correctly notes scholarly debates (ideal audience as literary composition, Jewish-Christian community, and Gentile-readership possibilities) and cites Luke’s parallel as a contextual comparator. The major caveat is a somewhat simplified depiction of Gundry’s position; other scholars describe his stance differently. Overall, the answer is thorough, well-contextualized, and appropriately cautious about scholarly disagreement."
