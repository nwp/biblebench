    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "**Short answer**\n\nNo.  The statement “As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become” is not compatible with orthodox Christian theology.  It expresses a view that is central to Mormon teaching—human beings can, in time, become like God (become “gods” or “child‑of‑Gods”), but Catholic, Orthodox and most evangelical–Reformed traditions hold that God is unchanging and that humans can participate in or be “made like God” only by grace, never by becoming God in the same essence.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What the statement means in its original context\n\nIn the early LDS literature the phrase was used to illuminate a distinctive gospel theme:\n\n1. **Human likeness to God** – “As man now is, God once was” stresses that the divine spirit has a human heart, a mortal body, and is an “exalted man.”  Mormon scripture (e.g., Doctrine & Covenants 93:4–8, Acts of the Apostles—LDS) teaches that “the Father was once a man” and that “the Son is He who became a man.”  \n2. **Progressive exaltation** – “As God now is, man may become” points to the belief that, after death, faithful Mormons can continue to progress, receive the highest priesthood, and ultimately “become God” (exaltation).\n\nThus the phrase encapsulates the doctrine of **eternal progression**: the “first Adam” is God‑like, the “second Adam” is human, and the *third Adam* (Jesus) is a bridge between the two; and mortals can ascend to the *third Adam’s* rank.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How mainstream Christianity interprets “becoming like God”\n\nChristianity uses a similar language—“to be *like* God” or “to become *in the likeness of God*”—but with very different theology.  Several key points must be noted:\n\n| Principle | Orthodox Christian view | LDS view (the statement) |\n|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Nature of God** | God is one, immutable, and ineffable.  (John 1 1, 1 10; Hebrews 1 8). | God was a man; God may become “like man” but also “God may become” (a new being). |\n| **Human participation in divinity** | Theosis/divinization: Christians are *partakers* of the divine nature by grace (2 Cor 5 17; 2 Pet 1 4; John 17 1; 1 John 5 4).  No claim that humans *become* God in essence. | Human beings, after faithful living and following the plan of salvation, become *gods* (exalted). |\n| **Change in God** | God does not change in nature or character (Immanuel: “God” is immutable; Phil. 2 13). | God is portrayed as increasing in glory, *transcending* or *becoming* more (sometimes described as “eternal progression of the Godhead”). |\n| **Scriptural support** | “God made us to be like Him” (1 Cor 1 6) – symbolic, not literal. | Doctrine & Covenants texts claim that God himself was once a man, and may become God. |\n\n### 2.1  Theological motifs that differ\n\n1. **The Trinity vs. Eternal Progression**  \n   - Orthodoxy holds that one God exists in three persons.  The *oneness* of God is essential.  If humans were to become God, this would disturb the Trinity’s essential unity and could invite polytheism (Kalam 12‑15).  \n   - LDS theology suggests that the “Father,” “Son,” and “Holy Ghost” are three *separate* gods who can develop and eventually become “gods.”  This is a form of **three‑person polytheism** contrary to Trinitarian doctrine.\n\n2. **Nature of the Divine vs. Nature of Man**  \n   - The Christian *divine nature* is *uncreated* and *eternal* (1 Sam 8:21; Isaiah 44:32).  Humans are created beings (John 1:3, 1 John 3:1).  The *mystery of Christ* reveals that the divine nature can be “made manifest” (2 Cor 5:18), but this is not “self‑becoming.”  \n   - Latter‑Day Saints assert that the divine nature itself can be *developed* in persons and that a human can *become* an exalted deity. This is a fundamentally different anthropological and soteriological picture.\n\n3. **Immaturity vs. Maturity in God’s Character**  \n   - Christian anthropology holds that human growth is to “become *like* God” in *character* (love, holiness, mercy). The word “maturity” in Christ’s soteriology (Phil. 3:20–21, 2 Cor 5:1, 2 Tim 3:9) is about *union* with Trinity, never a transformation into the Godhead.  \n   - The Latter‑Day Saint phrase uses “mature” in a literal ontological sense: God as a man maturing into a *higher* god.\n\n4. **Scriptural Foundations**  \n   - The Christian canon contains no clear statement that God ‘once was a man’ and that *man may become God*.  The passages cited in LDS scripture (e.g., D&C 20, 111) are not part of the Christian canon, and were written in the 19th‑century context.  \n   - In contrast, the LDS canon interprets some scriptural references (e.g., Genesis 3:17, 1 Ne 1:3, 1 Tim 3:16) as *support* for a progression of God, whereas mainstream Christianity reads them as metaphorical or historical.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Orthodox Christian perspectives on “becoming like God”\n\nAlthough the language of “becoming like God” is used by many churches, the *meaning* is sharply circumscribed:\n\n1. **Theosis (Eastern Orthodox)** – In the writings of Gregory Palamas, *theosis* is an experiential participation in the divine energies.  It is not a claim that one becomes “God” (the divine essence).  In Greek, “theosis” means “becoming god-like,” but the word *logos* has a technical sense distinct from the divine essence.\n\n2. **Deification/Congregation (Catholic)** – Catholic theologians like Thomas Aquinas speak of “participation in God” (participatio in divinis naturis), not a literal change of nature.  Aquinas wrote that humans are *instruments of God’s grace* and cannot attain the divine essence.\n\n3. **Eschatological union (Protestant)** – The evangelical tradition uses the “new creation” paradigm (Philippians 3:20–21, 1 Peter 1:23).  It affirms that believers will be made *like Christ* after resurrection.  Again, this is *union* with Christ, not an ontological identity with God.\n\n4. **Scriptural consistency** – Verses such as John 17:2–3 (“who is in the world, who is in the likeness of the world”) imply that while humans can *bear the likeness of God*, they cannot *be God* as a distinct being.  Moreover, Hebrews 1:8‑9 (“the Lord says to the Father, ‘Your throne…’”) affirms the unique, unchanging nature of the divine.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  The implications for the LDS teaching\n\n1. **The phrase distorts the biblical concept**: In Scripture, God does not “grow” through human development.  John 1:10: “He came into the world, and the world, it was created by Him.  God in His nature never changes.”  This immutability is a core doctrine for the Trinity.  \n\n2. **The phrase introduces the problem of polytheism**: If humans can become God, then multiple gods would exist.  Orthodox Christianity’s Trinitarian formula is specifically formulated to prevent that: *one eternal God in three persons*.\n\n3. **The phrase suggests a different soteriology**: In mainstream Christianity, salvation is an act of God’s grace, with the believer being *rescued* from sin and *made holy*.  The LDS view makes salvation more of a “promotion” or “rewards” system, where the ultimate goal is to become a god.  \n\n4. **Historical context**: The LDS phrase emerged from a 19th‑century reinterpretation of biblical texts in the context of American religious pluralism. It was part of a broader movement to assert a unique covenantal relationship between God and the LDS people (e.g., “the covenant of Abraham,” “the covenant of Isaac,” “the covenant of Jacob”).  These covenant titles have no equivalent in Orthodox or even mainstream Protestant traditions.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  How to communicate about this difference respectfully\n\n1. **Acknowledge the common scriptural ground**: Both traditions value Genesis, the Christological narrative, and the idea of “becoming *like* God.”  \n\n2. **Highlight the difference in nuance**: Use the phrase “participation in divine nature” vs. “becoming” to show the theological shift.\n\n3. **Invite dialog about the nature of God**: Explain why the Trinity is necessary for orthodox faith and how it preserves God’s unity and uniqueness.\n\n4. **Emphasize that the differences are not merely semantic**: They reflect divergent ontological assumptions and soteriological aims.\n\n5. **Offer resources**: Provide links to patristic writings (e.g., St. Athanasius, St. Augustine, St. Gregory Palamas), the Catholic Catechism (Ch. 4:3‑4), and respected expositions on the Trinity.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Bottom line\n\nOrthodox Christian theology—whether Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or evangelical—considers the statement “As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become” **not** to be in harmony with its doctrine.  The core problems are:\n\n1. **The nature of God** – Trinitarian and immutable vs. God as a developing being.  \n2. **Human participation** – Grace‑based “partership” vs. literal ontological identity with God.  \n3. **Scriptural evidence** – Absence of support for “eternal progression of the Godhead” in the canonical Christian scriptures.  \n\nWhile the LDS use the phrase to express an essential belief in eternal exaltation, orthodox Christianity maintains that we are “made in the image of God” and can be “made holy” and “like God” by grace, but we will never *become God* in essence.  The theological divergence is substantial, and orthodox Christianity would regard the statement as inconsistent with its core doctrines.",

The response cites D&C 93:4–8 and vaguely references 'Acts of the Apostles—LDS' as supporting this idea, which is not accurate and can mislead about what LDS scripture teaches.",
            "Oversimplified portrayal of LDS soteriology and the Godhead: The LLM characterizes the LDS view as a straightforward path to 'three separate gods who can develop into gods' and treats it as equivalent to polytheism in the standard Christian sense. LDS belief typically describes the Godhead as three distinct personages united in purpose, with exaltation possible for humanity, but the precise metaphysical details (and whether this constitutes 'polytheism' in orthodox terms) are more nuanced than presented. The response could mislead readers into thinking LDS teaching equates to clear-cut polytheism or a flat 'three separate gods' framework.)",
            "Some minor factual/informational inaccuracies: The LLM sometimes attributes specific LDS scriptural verses or statements in ways that are not canonical (e.g., implying canonical LDS scripture explicitly says 'the Father was once a man' or that D&C 93 explicitly teaches that). It also asserts generalities about 'eternal progression of the Godhead' without distinguishing the LDS emphasis on exaltation and human divinization from orthodox 'theosis' (which is about participation in divine life, not ontological becoming of the divine essence)."

          "rationale": "Overall, the response aligns with orthodox Christian critique: the statement is presented as incompatible with core Christian doctrines (immutability of God, strict monotheism, and soteriological emphasis on grace and union with Christ rather than ontological deification). It provides a useful contrast with the orthodox understanding of theosis (divinization) as participation in God's divine life, not becoming God in essence. However, it contains some historically and canonically imprecise claims about LDS scriptures (canonical status of the phrases, and the specific verses cited), and it presents LDS beliefs in a somewhat oversimplified way (e.g., 'three separate gods' and the nature of exaltation) that could mislead readers about the complexity and nuances of LDS theology. A tighter evaluation would separate canonical LDS scripture from later teachings/phrases, note the nuance in LDS doctrine about the Godhead, and ground critiques more explicitly in primary sources (e.g., patristic and scholastic treatments of divine immutability and theosis, and LDS primary sources and scholarly analyses)."
