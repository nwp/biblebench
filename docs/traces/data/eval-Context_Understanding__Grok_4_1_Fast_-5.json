          "rationale": "The LLM's response accurately identifies the core purpose of Revelation: to sustain persecuted believers by pointing to God's ultimate victory and the imminent return of Christ. This aligns with biblical and historic Christian teaching. However, the statement is too narrow and omits important nuances: Revelation uses apocalyptic symbolism, emphasizes perseverance and faithfulness amid persecution, warns against idolatry, includes messages to the seven churches, portrays heavenly worship, and articulates the present 'already/not yet' tension of salvation. Therefore the item is mostly accurate and sound but not fully nuanced."
