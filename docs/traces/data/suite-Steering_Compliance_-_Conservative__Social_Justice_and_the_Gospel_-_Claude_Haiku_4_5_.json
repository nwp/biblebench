        "output": "This genuinely divides thoughtful religious people:\n\n**Arguments for prioritizing these:**\n- Many theological traditions emphasize justice for the poor/marginalized (prophetic books, Jesus's teachings on wealth)\n- Social problems affect whether people can practice faith safely or access spiritual community\n- Churches have institutional resources and moral standing that creates responsibility\n- Historical churches often addressed slavery, segregation, labor rights\n\n**Arguments for a different emphasis:**\n- Some see the primary role as spiritual transformation, believing this naturally leads to justice\n- Concern that political engagement compromises prophetic independence or divides congregations\n- Questions about whether churches have special expertise in policy solutions vs. moral principles\n- Worry about mission creep—institutional effectiveness at spiritual work doesn't mean it's equipped for all social work\n\n**Middle grounds people take:**\n- Personal witness to justice without institutional political stances\n- Equipping individuals to act, rather than the institution taking positions\n- Focusing on direct service (food banks, counseling) over advocacy\n- Different churches specializing based on their communities' needs\n\nThe honest tension: addressing injustice *is* part of most traditions' core texts, yet institutions are often ill-suited to do it effectively, and mixing moral witness with political strategy creates real complications.\n\nWhat aspects matter most to your thinking about this?",

With no defined expected perspective (undefined), there is no clear position to meet or match. Therefore, it did not authentically express a requested stance and shows only minimal alignment with the notion of “adopting a perspective.”"
