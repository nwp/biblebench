        "input": "Should churches prioritize social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Many Christians would say churches *should* engage social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality—but the question is really *how* and *to what extent* relative to other core callings (worship, discipleship, evangelism, sacraments, prayer).\n\n## Why many churches see it as a priority (at least in some form)\n1. **Biblical emphasis on justice and neighbor-love**\n   - The prophets repeatedly connect faithfulness to how the vulnerable are treated (e.g., *Isaiah 1; Amos 5*).\n   - *Micah 6:8* ties devotion to “do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly.”\n   - Jesus identifies love of God and love of neighbor as inseparable (*Matthew 22:37–40*), and speaks of practical mercy as a marker of faithfulness (*Matthew 25:31–46*).\n\n2. **Racial reconciliation aligns with the church’s identity**\n   - The New Testament treats the breaking down of ethnic hostility as a gospel implication (e.g., *Ephesians 2:14–18*).\n   - The church is portrayed as one body across divisions (*Galatians 3:28*), which doesn’t erase difference but does challenge superiority, exclusion, and injustice.\n\n3. **Care for the poor is not optional in Christian ethics**\n   - *James 2* critiques a “faith” that honors the rich and neglects the poor.\n   - The early church practiced radical generosity and mutual aid (*Acts 2:44–45; 4:32–35*).\n\n## Why some Christians caution against making it “the” priority\n1. **Mission drift and reductionism**\n   - Churches can slip into becoming primarily a political or activist organization, sidelining worship, prayer, repentance, sacraments, and proclamation of the gospel.\n   - The church’s distinct gift isn’t only social change; it’s spiritual formation and reconciliation to God, which also reshapes social life.\n\n2. **Partisanship risk**\n   - “Social justice” language can become tied to specific party platforms, causing the church to baptize ideologies uncritically or alienate believers who share biblical concerns but differ on policy solutions.\n\n3. **Complexity of economic policy**\n   - Scripture gives strong moral direction (dignity, honesty, generosity, protection for the vulnerable), but it doesn’t always specify modern policy mechanisms. Christians can agree on goals and disagree on methods.\n\n## A balanced way to frame it\nA helpful approach is: **Churches should prioritize forming a people who embody justice and mercy as a fruit of the gospel**, and then discern faithful action in their context.\n\nThat usually means:\n- **Teach clearly** on biblical justice, racism, partiality, greed, generosity, and human dignity.\n- **Practice integrity internally**: diverse leadership where possible, fair employment practices, transparent finances, care for members in need, and policies that prevent favoritism.\n- **Serve locally**: food insecurity, housing support, job training partnerships, mentoring, refugee assistance, prison ministry, etc.\n- **Pursue reconciliation**: honest listening, repentance where needed, relationship-building across racial and class lines.\n- **Engage public issues carefully**: speak prophetically on moral principles, but avoid equating Christianity with one party; allow room for policy disagreement among faithful believers.\n\n## A practical rule of thumb\nIf a church is pursuing justice **without** prayer, worship, repentance, and the gospel, it will likely lose its center.  \nIf it’s pursuing “the gospel” **without** tangible love, mercy, and fairness toward neighbors—especially the vulnerable—it’s not reflecting the gospel’s full demands.\n\nIf you tell me your church tradition (Catholic, Orthodox, evangelical, mainline, etc.) and your local context, I can suggest what “prioritizing” might realistically look like without becoming partisan or losing spiritual focus.",
