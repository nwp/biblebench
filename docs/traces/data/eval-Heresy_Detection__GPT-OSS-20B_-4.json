    "expected": "This resembles Marcionism, a second-century heresy that rejected the Old Testament and taught there were two different gods. This is false. Orthodox Christianity affirms the unity of God across both Testaments. The same God who created the world, gave the law, and showed justice in the Old Testament is the God who sent Jesus. Jesus himself affirmed the Old Testament (Matthew 5:17-18) and revealed God's character as both just and merciful throughout scripture.",
    "output": "**Short answer:**  \nThe claim is *heretical* for the following reasons:\n\n| What the statement says | Why it is wrong (according to mainstream Christian doctrine) |\n|---|---|\n| “The God of the Old Testament is different from the God of the New Testament.” | Scripture teaches that the *same* God has always existed—Trinitarian, one in essence, two persons, eternally. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the *universal* God of Israel, of the Jewish prophets, and of the Christians. |\n| “The Old Testament God was wrathful and evil.” | The Old‑Testament God never “was evil.”  \n  * He is described as angry when the covenant is broken yet *always* righteous, merciful and covenant‑faithful (Psalm 103:8‑13; Psalm 89:14; Isaiah 53:5‑10).  \n  * “Wrathful” is a descriptive term for God’s *justice* (e.g., Romans 9:18), not a moral verdict. |\n| “Jesus revealed the true, good God.” | Jesus is *God* in person and role, not merely a revelation of a different function of the same God. The New‑Testament reveals the fullness of God’s character—love, mercy, justice—rather than “the true God” being a new entity. |\n\n\nBelow is a more detailed analysis that explains the theological problems in the statement and points to why orthodox Christianity rejects it.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Unity of God Across Scripture\n\n### a. Old‑Testament (OT) God\n- **Covenant God** – God repeatedly affirms His covenant relationship with the people of Israel (“I am the Lord, the God of your fathers… I am the God who watches over you”) (Deut. 32:4–5; Exod. 34:6‑7).  \n- **Righteous, Loving, and Just** – Psalm 89:14 says, “Justice and judgment are the foundations of your throne.”  \n- **Incarnation** – In a Mormon‑like or Gnostic reading, some might say the OT was a “lesser” God; however, prophetic readers (Isa. 43:11; Daniel 2:44) speak of the same God who will be “the God of all nations.”  \n\n### b. New‑Testament (NT) God\n- **Continuation of the Old‑Testament God** – Paul writes in Romans 9:1‑2 that the “grace and truth” are “not of the Israelites alone.”  \n- **The Same Trinity** – Paul affirms that the one God is revealed as Father, Son, and Spirit (e.g., 2 Cor. 13:14; 1 Cor. 15:24‑28).  \n- **Manifestation of Love Through the Incarnation** – Luke 1:35 says the Messiah is “the Son of God.” His incarnation is a *full redemption* of the old covenant rather than a new system.  \n\n**Orthodox Understanding:**  \nThe correct mainstream belief is that the *same* God (unified in essence and eternally one) is the God of the OT and the NT. *The Old‑Testament God is the Old‑Testament God*; *the New‑Testament God is the New‑Testament God* in a different level of revelation, not a different person or entity.\n\n---\n\n## 2. “Wrathful and Evil” Is Mischaracterizing God\n\n### Chalcedonian “wrath”\n- **God’s “wrath”** is the expression of His holiness and justice when sin is present (cf. Romans 9:18 “He might have shown mercy”).  \n- **God is not “evil.”** Scripture concedes that *God is far from evil* (Psalm 103:5; 1 John 4:8).  \n\n### Theological Motive: “Good God vs. Wrathful God”\n- The statement appears influenced by **dualistic** or **deistic** thoughts that view the Old‑Testament God’s wrath as a sign of a lesser or even an evil deity.  \n- Christianity teaches a God **who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent**. The “wrath” is a corrective action, not a moral flaw.\n\n### Scriptural Example of Justice and Mercy\n- **Isaiah 53**: “He was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities” – a description of suffering that reflects judgment but also ultimate salvation.  \n- **Romans 5:8**: “Who, though legally guilty, dies for some deserving…for those who do not yet call on God.”  \n\nThus, presenting the Old‑Testament God as “evil” grossly distorts covenanted Scripture.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Jesus Does Not “Reveal a Different God”\n\n### In Christianity, Jesus = God\n\n- **John 1:1–3**: “In the beginning was the Word… and the Word was God.”  \n- **Colossians 2:9**: “In [Christ] lives all the fullness of the deity in bodily form.”  \n\nThus, Jesus is *not a lesser or alternative deity*; He is the *same* deity who was everywhere known as the SJ. To separate the OT‑God from the NT‑God is to break faith in the *Incarnation*—the foundation of the Christian faith.\n\n### “True God” vs. “Old‑Testament God”\n- The NT texts (e.g., Hebrews 1:2‑3; 2:18‑22) explicitly show that the NT reveals the *full reality* of God's character, confirming the OT revelations.  \n\nSolomon’s statement “the true God” is thus a *desire for a fuller revelation, not a claim that a new god exists.*\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Heresy in Context\n\n### Key doctrines that the statement conflicts with\n\n1. **Monotheism** – The only monotheistic Jewish‑Christophilic tradition recognizes a *single* immutable God.  \n2. **Incarnation and Redemption** – An essential Christian belief is that the same God who created the world has become human (Christ) to atone.  \n3. **Continuity of the Covent** – The OT covenant is superseded, not aborted; it is fulfilled (Malachy 3) by the New Covenant.\n\n### Historically *heretical* positions resembling this statement\n\n| Heresy | Similarity |\n|--------|------------|\n| **Deism / Dualism** – “Old God\" punished, “New God” enlightened | Claim of separate, more compassionate God |\n| **Early Gnosticism** – “Higher, good god” vs. “lower, evil platon\" |  |\n| **Charismatic Baha’ism** – “God changed after 2000 yrs” |  |\n\n---\n\n## 5. How to Correct the View\n\n1. **Education about biblical theology** – Emphasise that the *same God* is present in both Testaments.  \n2. **Explain “wrathful” vs. “evil”** – Show that God's wrath is an expression of justice, not malice.  \n3. **Introduce the concept of revealing covenant** – OT reveals God's covenant with Israel; NT reveals the same covenant in a broader sense.  \n4. **Explain the person of Christ** – To depict Jesus as a “new god” denies the Incarnation and the sufficiency of the Old Testament revelations.  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Summary\n\n**Orthodox Christianity** holds that:\n\n- **God never changed.** The same Triune God revealed Himself progressively.  \n- **He is loving, merciful, and just**; His wrath is a merciful justice, never an evil disposition.  \n- **Jesus is the Incarnate God** – not a “new” deity but the fullest self‑revelation of the Old‑Testament God for humanity.  \n\nTherefore, the statement “The Old‑Testament God was wrathful and evil, while Jesus revealed the true, good God” is inconsistent with the core doctrines of the Christian faith and is therefore considered a heretical viewpoint.",
