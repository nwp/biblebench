    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "This teaching is **heretical**, not orthodox.\n\n### Why it is heretical\nThe claim that Jesus “was not truly divine” and was only **adopted as God’s Son at his baptism** is a classic form of **Adoptionism** (sometimes also connected with **dynamic monarchianism**). Adoptionism teaches that Jesus began as a merely human person and at some point—commonly his baptism—God “adopted” him and endowed him with divine power or sonship.\n\nOrthodox Christianity, by contrast, teaches that:\n\n1. **Jesus is truly divine by nature**, not by adoption.  \n   He is the eternal Son/Word of God. Key biblical texts include:\n   - **John 1:1–3, 14**: “the Word was God… and the Word became flesh”\n   - **Colossians 2:9**: “in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily”\n   - **Hebrews 1:3**: the Son is “the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature”\n\n2. **Jesus is the Son of God from eternity**, not made Son at a moment in time.  \n   Historic creeds summarize this as: **“begotten, not made”** (Nicene Creed). His baptism reveals and inaugurates his public ministry; it does not *create* his divine sonship.\n\n3. **The incarnation means one person with two natures** (divine and human).  \n   In orthodox Christology, Jesus is one divine Person (the Son) who truly assumed human nature. Adoptionism undermines this by implying Jesus becomes Son later, rather than being the Son who became man.\n\n### Historical/doctrinal context\n- The early church rejected Adoptionism as incompatible with apostolic teaching.  \n- The **Nicene Creed (325/381)** and later **Chalcedonian** Christology (451) protect precisely what this statement denies: the **full deity** of Christ and his eternal sonship.\n\n### What Christians do affirm about Jesus’ baptism\nAt Jesus’ baptism, the Father’s voice (“You are my beloved Son”) publicly **attests** who Jesus already is, and the Spirit’s descent marks the beginning of his mission (cf. Matthew 3:16–17). It is **revelation and commissioning**, not adoption.\n\n**Conclusion:** Denying Christ’s true divinity and asserting that he became God’s Son by adoption at baptism is **heretical** because it contradicts the biblical witness and the settled doctrinal consensus of historic Christianity expressed in the ecumenical creeds.",

It cites key biblical texts (John 1:1–14; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:3) and references the historic creeds (Nicene Creed) and Chalcedonian Christology, affirming the two natures and single person of Christ. It also clarifies that Jesus’ baptism reveals his mission and public identity, not the origin of his divinity. The answer situates the doctrine within historical context and avoids conflating adoption with legitimate revelation of Jesus’ mission, providing a precise and biblically grounded explanation."
