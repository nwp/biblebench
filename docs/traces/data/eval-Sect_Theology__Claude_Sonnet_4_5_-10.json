    "input": "Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science, wrote 'Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,' which Christian Scientists study alongside the Bible as authoritative revelation. What's the orthodox Christian perspective on this?",
    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity rejects placing any human writing on par with Scripture's unique divine authority. While commentaries, theological works, and devotional writings can be helpful, the Bible alone is the inspired, inerrant Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16-17). The canon of Scripture was closed by the early church, and no new revelations carry the same authority. Elevating Mary Baker Eddy's writings to scriptural status contradicts the sufficiency of Scripture and opens the door to doctrinal error. When Christian Science teachings contradict clear biblical doctrine (like the reality of sin, the nature of Christ's atonement, or the personality of God), this demonstrates the danger of adding extra-biblical authorities.",
    "output": "# Orthodox Christian Perspective on Christian Science's Dual Scripture Approach\n\n## The Core Issue\n\nOrthodox Christianity across all major traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant) holds that **divine revelation closed with the apostolic age**. The elevation of \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures\" to scriptural authority represents a fundamental departure from historic Christian teaching.\n\n## Specific Theological Concerns\n\n### 1. **The Sufficiency of Scripture**\n- **Orthodox view**: The Bible contains all knowledge necessary for salvation (2 Timothy 3:16-17)\n- **Protestant principle**: *Sola Scriptura* - Scripture alone as the final authority\n- **Catholic/Orthodox view**: Scripture plus Sacred Tradition, but no new revelation after the apostles\n- **Christian Science departure**: Adding authoritative revelation in the 19th century contradicts the \"faith once for all delivered to the saints\" (Jude 3)\n\n### 2. **The Nature of Christ**\nChristian Science teachings in this text deny core orthodox doctrines:\n- **The Incarnation**: Eddy's work redefines Jesus's physical nature\n- **The Atonement**: Reinterprets Christ's death as demonstrative rather than substitutionary\n- **The Resurrection**: Treats it as spiritual rather than bodily\n\nThese contradict ecumenical creeds (Nicene, Chalcedonian) affirmed across all orthodox traditions.\n\n### 3. **The Nature of Reality**\nEddy's metaphysical idealism (matter as illusion, evil as unreal) contradicts:\n- Biblical creation accounts affirming material reality as \"good\" (Genesis 1)\n- Christ's physical incarnation and resurrection\n- The Christian understanding of sin as real rebellion requiring real redemption\n\n## Historical Precedent\n\nThe early church faced similar situations with Gnostic texts claiming special revelation. The response was to:\n- Establish biblical canon based on apostolic origin and consistency\n- Reject texts teaching contrary doctrines, regardless of claimed inspiration\n- Affirm that revelation concluded with the apostles\n\n## Respectful Summary\n\nFrom an orthodox Christian perspective, treating \"Science and Health\" as co-equal with Scripture:\n- Violates the unique authority of biblical revelation\n- Introduces teachings incompatible with essential Christian doctrines\n- Places Christian Science outside orthodox Christianity, despite the name\n\nThis doesn't question the sincerity of Christian Scientists, but recognizes that doctrinal content, not nomenclature, determines theological classification.",

            "Overgeneralization: The claim that \"divine revelation closed with the apostolic age\" is simplified. Catholic and Orthodox teaching hold that public revelation is complete, and no new canonical revelation occurs, but Tradition and magisterial teaching continue to interpret and guard that revelation. This is not the same as saying God no longer reveals truth in any form; the statement could mislead readers about the ongoing role of Tradition and teaching authority in those traditions.",
            "Precision of scripture reference: The statement that \"the Bible contains all knowledge necessary for salvation (2 Timothy 3:16-17)\" reflects a common orthodox Protestant summary, but the exact wording of 2 Timothy 3:16-17 emphasizes Scripture as inspired and profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness rather than explicitly stating \"all knowledge necessary for salvation.\" This is a well-known Protestant formulation, but technically it’s a paraphrase rather than a direct quote.",
            "Limited discussion of private revelation: The response could acknowledge that Catholic/Orthodox traditions reject new public revelation but allow discernment of private revelations within church history, whereas Christian Science is rejecting biblical sufficiency and canonical status; addressing this distinction would improve nuance."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM's answer is largely aligned with historic Christian orthodoxy: Scripture is viewed as the primary and sufficient norm for faith and practice, Mary Baker Eddy's writings are not on par with Scripture, and Christian Science is portrayed as incompatible with core doctrines (Incarnation, Atonement, Resurrection) and with the sufficiency of Scripture. It correctly notes concerns about reality, sin, and the nature of Christ as taught in Christian Science. The main area for refinement is nuance about the Catholic/Orthodox stance on revelation (public revelation vs. Tradition and Magisterial teaching) and a precise rendering of 2 Timothy 3:16-17. Adjusting those points would sharpen doctrinal accuracy without changing the overall correct assessment."
