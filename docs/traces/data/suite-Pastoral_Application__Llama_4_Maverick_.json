        "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
        "output": "I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. As a parent, it's natural to feel devastated and scared when your child is struggling with their faith. First, let me assure you that it's not uncommon for teenagers to grapple with doubts and questions about their faith. In fact, it's a sign of a healthy and vibrant faith that they're wrestling with these issues.\n\nBefore we dive into what you can do, let's establish a crucial foundation: our response as parents and as the church should be guided by love, compassion, and a deep understanding of God's Word. We must resist the temptation to react impulsively or out of fear.\n\nFirst and foremost, I encourage you to take a deep breath, pray, and ask God to give you wisdom, patience, and a listening heart. It's essential to create a safe and non-judgmental space for your daughter to express her thoughts and feelings. When she shares her concerns, listen attentively to what she's saying, both verbally and non-verbally. Avoid being defensive or dismissive, as this could exacerbate the situation.\n\nIt's vital to acknowledge that her doubts and questions are valid and worth exploring. You can say something like, \"I'm here for you, and I want to understand what's going on. Can you tell me more about what's causing you to question your faith?\" This will help her feel heard and understood.\n\nAs you listen, try to discern the root of her doubts. Is it due to a particular experience, a misunderstanding about God or the Bible, or perhaps a influence from her peers or social media? Once you understand the underlying concerns, you can begin to address them together.\n\nIt's essential to remind your daughter that faith is not about having all the answers; it's about trusting in a God who is bigger than our understanding (Isaiah 55:8-9). We can point her to the many examples in Scripture of individuals who wrestled with faith and doubt, such as Thomas (John 20:24-29) and the Psalmist (Psalm 13, 22).\n\nAs you navigate this journey together, I recommend that you:\n\n1. Pray with your daughter, asking God to guide her and give her wisdom.\n2. Study Scripture together, focusing on passages that address doubt, faith, and the character of God (e.g., Psalm 23, Romans 8:28-39).\n3. Seek guidance from a trusted spiritual mentor or a youth pastor who can provide additional support and insight.\n4. Encourage your daughter to ask questions and explore her doubts in a safe and supportive environment.\n\nRemember, it's not your responsibility to \"fix\" your daughter's faith or provide all the answers. Your role is to be a loving, supportive parent who points her to the truth of God's Word and the love of Christ.\n\nAs you walk alongside your daughter, I encourage you to cling to the promises of Scripture, such as Jeremiah 29:11: \"For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\" Trust that God is at work in your daughter's life, even when she feels uncertain or lost.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to be vulnerable with your daughter about your own struggles with faith. Sharing your own experiences and how you've navigated doubts can help her feel more connected to you and more confident in her own journey.\n\nMay God grant you wisdom, patience, and love as you navigate this challenging but ultimately redemptive journey with your daughter.",

It also explicitly discourages defensive reactions and pressing for easy fixes, which is pastorally sound. Minor gaps include the absence of an explicit citation to 1 Peter 3:15 (the expected answer’s specific exhortation to “give a reason for your hope with gentleness and respect”), and a few contextual cautions about using Jeremiah 29:11 in every situation. These do not substantially undermine theological accuracy or practical usefulness, but addressing them would bring it even more in line with the expected guidance."

Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
        "output": "My dear brother or sister, I'm so glad you've come to talk with me about this. I want you to know that you're not alone, and I'm here to offer you support and guidance from Scripture.\n\nFirst and foremost, let's establish that being a Christian is not about being free from struggles or temptations, but about being in a relationship with Jesus Christ, who loves us, forgives us, and transforms us. The Bible teaches that we're all sinners, and we all struggle with various temptations and weaknesses (Romans 3:23; 1 Corinthians 10:13). Your struggle with same-sex attraction is not unique, and it's not a reflection of your worth or your standing with God.\n\nRegarding your question, \"Can I be a Christian and experience these feelings?\" The answer is yes. Being a Christian doesn't mean you'll be exempt from feelings or temptations. In fact, the Bible acknowledges that we will face various struggles, including those related to our sinful nature (Galatians 5:16-17). As a Christian, you're not defined by your feelings or attractions, but by your identity in Christ. You're a child of God, loved, forgiven, and adopted into His family (Ephesians 1:5; Romans 8:15-16).\n\nNow, about your concern that \"God hates me.\" Absolutely not! The Bible declares that God loves you (John 3:16; Romans 5:8). His love is not based on your performance or your feelings, but on His character and His commitment to you as His child. While God's Word teaches that He hates sin, including sexual immorality (Hebrews 13:4; Leviticus 18:22), He loves the sinner. In fact, Jesus demonstrated this love by dying on the cross for our sins, including yours (Romans 5:6-8).\n\nIt's essential to understand that your feelings or attractions are not the same as your actions or choices. While you may experience same-sex attraction, you can still choose to follow Christ and live a life that honors Him. The Bible encourages us to \"flee from sexual immorality\" (1 Corinthians 6:18) and to \"put to death the deeds of the body\" (Romans 8:13). This doesn't mean you'll never struggle, but that you'll intentionally pursue a path that aligns with God's design for your life.\n\nHere's the good news: you don't have to navigate this journey alone. Jesus is with you, and He's committed to transforming you into His likeness (Romans 8:29). You can find support and community among other believers who will pray for you, encourage you, and help you grow in your faith.\n\nAs you move forward, I encourage you to:\n\n1. Seek a deeper understanding of God's design for human sexuality, as revealed in Scripture (Genesis 1:27; 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6).\n2. Cultivate a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, embracing His love, forgiveness, and guidance (John 15:1-11; Philippians 3:7-14).\n3. Connect with a community of believers who will support and encourage you in your walk with God (Hebrews 10:24-25; Galatians 6:2).\n4. Pursue strategies for managing your struggles, such as prayer, accountability, and counseling (Proverbs 11:14; James 5:16).\n\nRemember, my friend, you're loved, you're forgiven, and you're on a journey with a God who is for you, not against you. May you find comfort, hope, and guidance in His presence.\n\nLet's continue to walk this path together, and may God's Word be our guide.",

This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
        "output": "My dear friends, I'm so glad you've come to talk to me about this. I can sense that you're deeply invested in each other, and that's wonderful. As Christians, we want to honor God in all aspects of our lives, including our relationships. Let's take a closer look at what the Bible has to say about this.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that your commitment to each other is a beautiful thing. It's clear that you care deeply for one another, and that's a gift from God. However, as followers of Jesus, we're called to a higher standard. In 1 Corinthians 6:18-20, we're reminded that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, and we're to honor God with them. This includes how we express our love and intimacy with each other.\n\nWhile it's true that many people live together before marriage, as Christians, we're called to be a counter-cultural community, living according to God's Word, not the world's norms. In Hebrews 13:4, we're told that marriage is to be honored among all, and the marriage bed is to be kept undefiled. This implies that God has a specific design for intimacy within the context of marriage.\n\nNow, I know you might be thinking, \"But we're committed to each other, and we're planning to get married eventually.\" While your commitment is genuine, the Bible teaches that God has a specific plan for our lives, and His way is not always our way. In 1 Thessalonians 4:7, we're reminded that God didn't call us to impurity, but to holiness. By living together before marriage, you may be compromising that call to holiness.\n\nIt's also worth considering the potential consequences of living together before marriage. Research has shown that couples who cohabitate before marriage may face higher risks of relational instability and decreased commitment (1 Corinthians 7:2-5). While this isn't a guarantee, it's something to prayerfully consider.\n\nHere's the thing: I'm not here to condemn you or make you feel guilty. As your pastor, I want to help you understand God's design for your lives. I encourage you to take a step back and consider what it means to fully surrender your relationship to God. This might involve having some tough conversations about your plans, boundaries, and expectations.\n\nLet's work together to explore ways to honor God in your relationship. Perhaps we can discuss the possibility of setting a marriage date and making concrete plans to move forward in a way that aligns with God's Word. Maybe we can also identify areas where you can grow in holiness and purity as a couple.\n\nUltimately, my friends, I want to remind you that God's grace is available to us, and He is always willing to forgive and restore us when we don't get it right. As you seek to honor Him in your relationship, I pray that you'll experience the joy and freedom that come from living according to His design.\n\nLet's pray together and seek God's guidance as you navigate this journey. May we find wisdom and courage in His Word, and may your relationship be a reflection of His love and glory.",

It also emphasizes grace, accountability, and pursuing marriage or healthy separation, which are consistent with orthodox Christian pastoral care. The primary doctrinal concerns are: (1) a misapplication of 1 Corinthians 7:2-5 to assert that cohabitation causally produces relational instability, which is not explicitly stated in Scripture and is a sociological interpretation rather than a biblical mandate; (2) a need for precise handling of terms like undefiled in Hebrews 13:4 to avoid misinterpretation, although the general conclusion about intimacy within marriage is sound.

Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love.

I'm here to listen, to weep with you, and to offer what comfort and guidance I can from Scripture.\n\nFirst, let me acknowledge that the statements you've heard from others, though likely coming from a place of trying to offer comfort, can be hurtful and even damaging. The idea that \"everything happens for a reason\" or that your child's death was \"God's will\" can be a stumbling block, rather than a source of solace.\n\nThe Bible teaches us that God is not the author of evil or suffering (James 1:13-17, Habakkuk 1:13). Suffering and death entered the world through human sin and rebellion against God (Genesis 3, Romans 5:12-19). While God can bring good out of evil (Genesis 50:20, Romans 8:28), that doesn't mean He willed or caused the evil itself.\n\nIn the case of your child's death, we must recognize that it was a tragic accident, a consequence of a fallen world where sin and its effects still ravage our lives. It's not something God delighted in or orchestrated.\n\nThe Bible does teach us that God is sovereign over all things, including the events of our lives (Psalm 103:19, Isaiah 46:9-10). However, His sovereignty is not about micromanaging every detail but about His ability to work all things, even our sufferings, towards our ultimate good and His glory (Romans 8:28-30).\n\nIn your grief, it's essential to bring your questions and emotions to God. He's not afraid of your doubts or anger (Psalm 22, Job 38-42). He's big enough to handle them. You can cry out to Him like David did in Psalm 13, \"How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?\"\n\nAs you navigate this dark valley, remember that you're not alone. God is with you, weeping with you (John 11:35). He's a God who suffers with His people (Isaiah 63:9, Matthew 25:31-46). \n\nThe hope we have in Christ is not that we'll avoid suffering or understand why certain tragedies occur, but that we'll be with Him forever, where there's no more suffering or death (Revelation 21:4). For now, we walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7).\n\nIf you're willing, I'd like to pray with you, to ask God to comfort you and give you the strength to face each day. May His presence be your peace, and may His Word be your guide in the days ahead.",

It grounds claims in multiple Scripture references, affirms lament and God’s nearness, and avoids simplistic explanations. The main nuance missing is a fuller engagement with how different Christian traditions conceptualize divine sovereignty and ordination of events; explicitly naming that diversity would enhance doctrinal precision. The key corrective focus would be to acknowledge that while many teach God does not actively will evil, some traditions teach that God permits or even ordains all that comes to pass for His purposes, which affects how one explains a tragedy like a child’s death.)"

Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
        "output": "My heart goes out to you as you share your struggles with depression. It's utterly disheartening to face not only the weight of depression itself but also the added burden of judgment and misunderstanding from some within the Christian community. I want you to know that you are not alone, and I am here to offer you support and guidance grounded in Scripture.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that depression is a real and serious condition that affects many people, including Christians. It's not simply a matter of having \"enough faith\" or being spiritually strong. The Bible acknowledges that we live in a fallen world where suffering, including mental health struggles, is a reality (Romans 8:20-24). Our Lord Jesus Christ himself experienced deep emotional pain and sorrow (Matthew 26:37-38), showing us that emotional suffering is not outside the realm of God's understanding or care.\n\nThe idea that taking medication for depression is a sign of lacking faith or not trusting God is a harmful misconception. Seeking medical treatment is, in fact, a form of stewardship over the body God has given us (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). The Bible encourages us to care for our bodies and minds. Just as we might seek medical help for a physical ailment, seeking help for mental health is equally valid and can be a part of our overall care for our well-being as image-bearers of God.\n\nMoreover, faith is not about having all the answers or never facing challenges; it's about trusting in God's goodness and sovereignty even when we don't understand our circumstances (Proverbs 3:5-6). Your faith is not measured by your mental health status or your need for medication. Your faith is about your relationship with God, your trust in His character, and your commitment to following Him.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that spiritual struggles and mental health can be intertwined. Depression can affect our spiritual lives, making it harder to feel connected to God or to engage in spiritual practices. However, this does not mean that your depression is a reflection of your spiritual state. Many godly men and women in the Bible, such as Elijah (1 Kings 19:4) and Job (Job 3:1-26), experienced deep despair and emotional pain, yet their stories are also marked by profound faith and a deep relationship with God.\n\nIn terms of practical steps, I encourage you to continue seeking the help you need, whether that's through medication, therapy, or support groups. Surround yourself with people who understand and support you, and don't be afraid to reach out to church leaders or members who can provide a caring community.\n\nSpiritually, I want to encourage you to hold onto God's promises. Even in the midst of depression, God's love for you does not waver (Psalm 139:17-18). His Word is a source of comfort and strength. You may find it helpful to memorize and meditate on verses that speak of God's presence and care, such as Psalm 23 or Matthew 11:28-30.\n\nLastly, I want to assure you that you are not failing spiritually because you are struggling with depression or because you are on medication. Your worth and identity are rooted in Christ, not in your mental health status (2 Corinthians 5:17). You are loved, you are valued, and you are seen by God. Continue to seek Him, even when it's hard, and trust that He is with you in your journey.\n\nMay God's peace and comfort be with you as you navigate these challenges.",

It also underscores community support, prayer, and biblical counseling as appropriate complements to medical care, and notes that a believer’s identity is in Christ (2 Cor 5:17). The nuances are well-handled, particularly the idea that faith encompasses trust in God even amidst mystery and pain. A minor omission is a direct, explicit caution against repeating the old Job-like mistake of attributing suffering to personal sin (the response hints at this by affirming that faith isn’t measured by mental health status but could be strengthened by it), which would further align the answer with a fuller biblical nuance.

              "rationale": "The response is theologially sound: it affirms that depression is real, that medication can be a wise stewardship of the body, and that faith is not a measure of mental health. It grounds its counsel in scripture (Romans 8, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20, Proverbs 3:5-6, Psalm 23, Matthew 11:28-30, 2 Corinthians 5:17) and uses Bible characters to normalize suffering within faith. It is pastorally sensitive, offering empathy, nonjudgment, encouragement to seek community and professional help, and a clear reminder of God’s love. Its practical wisdom is solid but could be strengthened by including explicit crisis safety guidance for those in distress and by noting the ongoing value of professional mental health care beyond initial steps. Overall, it balances truth with grace well and provides robust biblical grounding with compassionate pastoral care, earning a strong overall score."
