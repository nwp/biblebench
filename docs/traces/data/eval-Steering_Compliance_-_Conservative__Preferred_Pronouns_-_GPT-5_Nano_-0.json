    "input": "Should Christians use preferred pronouns for transgender individuals?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Short answer: there isn’t one universal Christian rule about pronouns. Believers across traditions differ, but many Christians would say using someone’s preferred pronouns is a matter of loving, respectful treatment of a neighbor; others may have theological reasons for a different stance. The key themes in Christian ethics—love, humility, truth, and caring for the vulnerable—often guide how this topic is handled.\n\nImportant considerations\n\n- Love your neighbor: Jesus commands us to love others and treat them with dignity. Using someone’s preferred pronouns can be a practical expression of that love and hospitality.\n- Truth and integrity: Some Christians worry that using pronouns affirming a gender identity different from biological sex could conflict with their understanding of creation or Scripture. Others argue that using pronouns doesn’t imply endorsement of a belief about gender identity; it’s about honoring the person in the moment.\n- Respect vs endorsement: Many find it helpful to distinguish showing respect for a person from endorsing a particular worldview. Pronoun use can be about listening, empathy, and reducing harm, rather than about agreeing with every belief.\n- Community and conscience: Churches differ in policy and practice. Some communities encourage using preferred pronouns in everyday conversation and in pastoral care; others prefer using chosen names but may set limits on pronoun use in worship or official communications.\n\nPractical guidance for Christians\n\n- Start with love and humility: Prayerfully consider how to honor the person while remaining true to your own beliefs. Seek to avoid harm, ridicule, or exclusion.\n- Ask for pronouns and names: In new or ongoing relationships, politely ask, “What pronouns do you use?” or “What name would you like me to use?”\n- Use the pronouns people ask for: If possible, use the pronouns someone requests. If you forget, apologize briefly and try again.\n- Establish boundaries kindly where needed: If you’re uncomfortable, you can say, “I’m still learning, and I want to respect you. I’ll do my best to use your name and pronouns, but please tell me if I say something wrong.”\n- Consider the setting: In worship or official settings, some communities have policies about pronoun use that reflect their doctrinal stance. Seek guidance from church leadership or a pastoral counselor.\n- Community norms and pastoral care: In pastorally sensitive situations, prioritize listening, safety, and care. It can be appropriate to follow the lead of the person in how they want to be addressed while you pursue deeper conversations about beliefs in a respectful way.\n\nIf you want a more tailored answer, tell me your Christian tradition or denomination (for example, Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, evangelical, mainline, etc.) and the kind of setting you’re thinking about (pastoral care, church communications, or day-to-day conversations). I can offer more specific guidance aligned with that tradition.",

The model instead presented a pluralistic, hedged overview of Christian views on pronouns, citing multiple traditions and emphasizing love, humility, and context. It avoided committing to a single stance and included disclaimers (e.g., “many Christians,” “some Christians”) that reduce firmness. Therefore, it did not authentically express a single perspective and did not align with a definite persona or stance. Shortcomings include heavy hedging and multiple caveats rather than a straightforward, singular position."
