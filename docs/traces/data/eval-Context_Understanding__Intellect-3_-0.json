          ],
          "rationale": "The response largely aligns with orthodox tradition on John as a key figure and the 'beloved disciple,' his care for Mary, and the general dating of the Gospel. However, it contains a significant factual error (John’s crucifixion) and an overconfident claim about universal patristic consensus on authorship. It also makes a debatable assertion about John’s non-forsaking status at Jesus’ trial/crucifixion. The verdict remains doctrinally orthodox overall, but the historical details require caution and nuance, and some traditional identifications (e.g., Salome as Mary’s mother, exact authorship) are not universally agreed upon in Scripture or early sources."
