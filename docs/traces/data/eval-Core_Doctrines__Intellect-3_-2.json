    "expected": "Justification by faith is the doctrine that sinners are declared righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus Christ, not by their own works or merit. It is a legal declaration by God where the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, and their sins are forgiven. This justification is received through faith alone (sola fide), by grace alone (sola gratia), based on Christ's finished work alone (solus Christus).",
    "output": "## The Doctrine of Justification by Faith: Becoming Righteous Before God\n\nJustification by faith is a cornerstone doctrine of historic Christianity, central to the gospel message. It addresses the fundamental human problem of sin and how a holy, righteous God can declare a sinful person righteous. Here's a clear, biblically grounded explanation:\n\n**1. The Problem: Human Sinfulness and God's Righteousness**\n*   **All Have Sinned:** The Bible unequivocally states that all humanity is marred by sin (Romans 3:23, 5:12). Sin is not merely a mistake but a fundamental rebellion against God's law and character, separating humanity from a holy God (Isaiah 59:2).\n*   **God's Righteous Standard:** God is perfectly holy, just, and righteous. He cannot ignore sin or compromise His standard (Habakkuk 1:13, Romans 2:11). His justice demands that sin be punished (Romans 6:23a).\n\n**2. The Impossibility of Self-Righteousness**\n*   **No Human Merit:** The Bible emphatically rejects the idea that anyone can achieve righteousness through their own efforts, moral achievements, religious rituals, or law-keeping (Romans 3:20, 4:4-5; Galatians 2:16, 21; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5). Our best works are inherently flawed by sin and insufficient to meet God's perfect standard (Isaiah 64:6).\n\n**3. God's Solution: The Work of Jesus Christ**\n*   **Christ's Sacrifice:** Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man, lived a sinless life perfectly fulfilling the law on our behalf (Romans 5:19, Hebrews 4:15). He then offered Himself as a substitutionary sacrifice on the cross, bearing the full penalty for human sin – God's wrath and condemnation (Romans 3:25, 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Peter 2:24, 3:18).\n*   **Satisfaction of God's Justice:** Through His death, Christ satisfied the demands of God's justice, paying the debt of sin owed by humanity. He propitiated (turned away) God's wrath (Romans 3:25, 1 John 2:2).\n*   **Righteousness Provided:** Christ's perfect obedience and sacrificial death *provide* a righteousness that is not our own. He *is* the righteousness of God (2 Corinthians 5:21), and through His work, a perfect righteousness is made available to sinners.\n\n**4. The Instrument: Faith (Sola Fide - Faith Alone)**\n*   **Faith Defined:** Faith (Greek *pistis*) is not mere intellectual assent or optimism. It is a whole-hearted trust, reliance, and commitment to Jesus Christ and His finished work on the cross. It involves acknowledging one's own sinfulness and inability, and placing complete confidence in Christ alone for salvation.\n*   **Faith as the Instrument:** Justification is received *through faith* (Romans 3:28, 5:1; Galatians 2:16; Ephesians 2:8). Faith is the empty hand that receives the gift of God's grace. It is not the *basis* of justification (Christ's work is), but the *instrument* by which we lay hold of Christ and His righteousness.\n*   **Contrast with Works:** Faith is set in direct opposition to works-righteousness (Romans 4:4-5). Boasting is excluded because faith acknowledges that salvation is entirely a gift of God's grace (Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 4:5).\n\n**5. The Act of Justification**\n*   **Forensic Declaration:** Justification is a *legal* or *forensic* act of God. It is not a process but a decisive declaration. God, the righteous Judge, declares a believing sinner to be righteous based *not* on their own merit, but on the merit of Jesus Christ, credited to them through faith.\n*   **Imputation:** The righteousness of Christ is *imputed* (counted, credited) to the believer's account (Romans 4:6-8, 22-25; Galatians 3:6, 2 Corinthians 5:21). Simultaneously, the believer's sin is *imputed* to Christ, who bore it on the cross (Isaiah 53:6, 2 Corinthians 5:21, 1 Peter 2:24).\n*   **Positional Righteousness:** The believer is declared righteous *positionally* before God. This is their new standing in Christ, granted by grace through faith.\n\n**6. The Result: Peace with God and New Life**\n*   **Reconciliation:** Justification removes the barrier of sin, resulting in peace with God (Romans 5:1).\n*   **Adoption:** Justified sinners are adopted as children of God (Romans 8:15-17, Galatians 4:4-7).\n*   **Sanctification:** While distinct from justification (which is a one-time declaration), justification inevitably leads to *sanctification* – the lifelong process of becoming more like Christ (Romans 6, Ephesians 2:10). Good works flow from gratitude for salvation, not as a means to earn it.\n*   **Future Hope:** Justification guarantees future glorification – the full redemption of the believer and creation (Romans 5:9-10, 8:29-30).\n\n**Key Biblical Passages:**\n*   Romans 1:16-17, 3:21-26, 4:1-8, 5:1, 8:29-30\n*   Galatians 2:15-21, 3:1-14, 3:21-26\n*   Ephesians 2:8-10\n*   Titus 3:3-7\n*   2 Corinthians 5:21\n*   Genesis 15:6 (Abraham's faith counted as righteousness - foundational)\n*   Habakkuk 2:4 (The righteous shall live by faith)\n\n**In Summary:** A person becomes righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus Christ. Recognizing their own sinfulness and inability, they trust completely in Christ's perfect life and sacrificial death as the sole sufficient payment for their sins. God, acting justly through Christ, declares the believing sinner righteous, imputing Christ's righteousness to them. This justification is a gracious gift received by faith alone, resulting in peace with God, adoption into His family, and the promise of eternal life. It is the foundational act of salvation upon which the Christian life is built.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately explains justification by faith: humans are sinners, Christ’s atonement satisfies divine justice, and justification is received by faith alone, by grace, through the work of Christ. It correctly emphasizes forensic (legal) justification, imputation of Christ’s righteousness, and the rejection of merit-based righteousness. It includes key biblical supports (Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, 2 Corinthians, etc.) and preserves the distinction between justification and sanctification while noting adoption and future glorification. Minor caveats for nuance: some formulations (e.g., phrasing around propitiation and Christ’s righteousness) could be clarified to avoid potential misreadings (e.g., distinguishing Christ’s righteousness imputed to believers from Christ Himself as the source of righteousness). Overall, the response aligns well with historic orthodox teaching (sola fide, sola gratia, solus Christus) and biblical grounding."
