    "input": "Explain justification by faith. How does someone become righteous before God?",
    "expected": "Justification by faith is the doctrine that sinners are declared righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus Christ, not by their own works or merit. It is a legal declaration by God where the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, and their sins are forgiven. This justification is received through faith alone (sola fide), by grace alone (sola gratia), based on Christ's finished work alone (solus Christus).",
    "output": "### 1) What “justification” means\n\n**Justification** is God’s **legal (forensic) act** in which he **declares** a sinner to be **righteous in his sight**, not because the person has become morally perfect, but because God counts them righteous **on the basis of Jesus Christ**.\n\n- “Justified” is courtroom language: to **vindicate/declare righteous**, the opposite of “condemn” (Rom 8:33–34; Prov 17:15).\n- It answers the question: **How can a guilty person be right with a holy God?** (Rom 3:19–26)\n\nSo justification is primarily about **status before God**, not the inward moral transformation (that is more properly **sanctification**, though the two are inseparable in a living faith).\n\n---\n\n### 2) Why we need justification\n\nScripture teaches that all people are sinners and therefore **not righteous before God**:\n\n- “None is righteous, no, not one” (Rom 3:10)\n- “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Rom 3:23)\n\nBecause God is just, sin brings real guilt and judgment (Rom 6:23). We cannot fix this by moral effort or religious performance.\n\n---\n\n### 3) The ground of justification: Christ’s atoning work\n\nGod justifies sinners **because of Christ’s saving work**, especially:\n\n**(a) Christ’s death for our sins (substitutionary atonement)**  \n- God put Christ forward “to be a propitiation by his blood… so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus” (Rom 3:24–26).  \n- “Christ died for our sins” (1 Cor 15:3).  \n- “He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree” (1 Pet 2:24).\n\n**(b) Christ’s resurrection (vindication and life)**  \n- Jesus “was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification” (Rom 4:25).  \nHis resurrection confirms that the payment for sin is accepted and that new life is secured for those united to him.\n\n---\n\n### 4) The means/instrument: faith alone (not works)\n\nThe consistent biblical teaching is that we are justified **by faith**, not by works:\n\n- “We hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law” (Rom 3:28).  \n- “To the one who does not work but believes… his faith is counted as righteousness” (Rom 4:5).  \n- “A person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ” (Gal 2:16).  \n- “By grace you have been saved through faith… not a result of works” (Eph 2:8–9).\n\n**Faith is not the “meritorious cause”** of justification; it is the **empty hand** that receives Christ. The **ultimate source** is God’s grace; the **basis** is Christ’s righteousness; the **instrument** is faith.\n\n---\n\n### 5) How does faith make someone righteous? (Imputation and union with Christ)\n\nA key biblical idea is that in justification God **credits** righteousness to the believer because the believer is **united to Christ**.\n\n- Abraham: “He believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness” (Gen 15:6; quoted in Rom 4:3).  \n- Paul describes “the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe” (Rom 3:22).  \n- The great exchange: “For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Cor 5:21).  \n- “Not having a righteousness of my own… but that which comes through faith in Christ” (Phil 3:9).\n\nIn short: **our sin is counted to Christ** (he bears its guilt and penalty), and **Christ’s righteousness is counted to us** (we are accepted as righteous in God’s court).\n\n---\n\n### 6) What about repentance, obedience, and James?\n\n**Repentance and faith** belong together in conversion (Mark 1:15; Acts 20:21). Turning to Christ includes turning away from sin—not as a payment, but as the posture of a heart coming to God.\n\n**Good works do not justify**, but **justifying faith produces good works**:\n\n- “We are… created in Christ Jesus for good works” (Eph 2:10).  \n- James says, “a person is justified by works and not by faith alone” (Jas 2:24). James is not contradicting Paul; he is addressing a different problem: a **dead ‘faith’** that is merely verbal. James argues that genuine faith is **shown** (vindicated as real) by works (Jas 2:17–18). Paul argues that works are not the **basis** on which God declares us righteous (Rom 4:1–6).\n\nA good summary is: **we are justified by faith alone, but not by a faith that is alone**.\n\n---\n\n### 7) So how does someone become righteous before God?\n\nBiblically, a person becomes righteous before God by:\n\n1. **Hearing the gospel of Christ** (Rom 10:17; 1 Cor 15:1–4)  \n2. **Repenting and believing**—personally trusting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior (Mark 1:15; John 3:16; Rom 10:9–10)  \n3. Being **justified by God’s grace**—God forgives sins and counts the believer righteous **in Christ** (Rom 3:24; 5:1)\n\nTherefore: **Someone is righteous before God not by earning righteousness, but by receiving Christ by faith—so that God declares them righteous because of Jesus.**",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response aligns closely with historic Christian orthodoxy, especially evangelical Protestant soteriology, on justification by faith. Key strengths include: (1) Forensic, legal understanding of justification—God declares the believer righteous, not because of moral perfection but on the basis of Christ, which corresponds to classic statements like Romans 3:28 and 4:5; (2) Ground and means of justification—Christ’s atoning death (substitutionary atonement) and resurrection are presented as the grounds, with faith as the instrument (not as a meritorious cause); (3) Imputation and union with Christ—righteousness credited to believers through faith in Christ, supported by Rom 3:22, 4:3, 2 Cor 5:21, etc.; (4) Faith’s proper place—emphasizes grace, sola fide, and the idea that justification is received by faith, not earned by works, while acknowledging that genuine faith bears fruit (the “not by works, but faith that works” nuance via James 2); (5) Reconciliation of Paul and James—acknowledges differing contexts (dead vs living faith) and resolves apparent tension between Paul’s forgiveness-by-faith and James’ evidence-by-works language; (6) Clear steps for becoming righteous—hearing the gospel, repentance and faith, and justification by grace in Christ. The response also differentiates justification from sanctification, noting they are related but not identical, and affirms repentance and obedience as fruits of genuine faith. Nuance is captured through references to key texts (Rom 3, Rom 4, Gal 2:16, Eph 2:8–9, 5:21; 2 Cor 5:21; Jas 2) and by addressing the doctrinal tension between faith and works. Potential enhancements (not errors) could include explicit mention of adoption and a slightly broader view of sanctification as ongoing transformation in addition to forensic declaration. Overall, the content is biblically grounded and theologically sound."

          "explanation": "The provided response articulates a standard orthodox Protestant/Reformation soteriology: justification by faith alone (sola fide) grounded in Christ's substitutionary atonement and resurrection, with imputed righteousness and union with Christ. It correctly treats justification as a status before God rather than a moral transformation, and it affirms that good works follow from faith. It dialogues appropriately with James 2 to avoid lapsing into a dead faith. No identified heresies (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, etc.) are present. If anything, minor caveats could be raised from other Christian traditions (e.g., Catholic teaching on infused righteousness or the exact relationship of justification and sanctification), but these do not constitute heresy in the context of mainstream Christian orthodoxy."
