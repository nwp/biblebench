It quotes Scripture relevant to justice and social action (Micah 6:8; Isaiah 1:17; Matthew 5:13-16; Luke 10:25-37) to justify both engagement and spiritual concerns, acknowledges historical Christian involvement in social reform, and also warns against overreach and political entanglement by appealing to Jesus' statement that his kingdom is not of this world. It frames the issue as a spectrum with qualified positions rather than a single doctrinal mandate, and it asks disciplined questions about gospel priority, humility, and identity. It does not press a doctrinally conservative program (e.g., specific political doctrines or strict inerrancy) nor does it push a progressive redefinition; instead it foregrounds prudence and pastoral discernment, signaling a moderate stance that allows legitimate diversity of views.",
