    "input": "Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science, wrote 'Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,' which Christian Scientists study alongside the Bible as authoritative revelation. What's the orthodox Christian perspective on this?",
    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity rejects placing any human writing on par with Scripture's unique divine authority. While commentaries, theological works, and devotional writings can be helpful, the Bible alone is the inspired, inerrant Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16-17). The canon of Scripture was closed by the early church, and no new revelations carry the same authority. Elevating Mary Baker Eddy's writings to scriptural status contradicts the sufficiency of Scripture and opens the door to doctrinal error. When Christian Science teachings contradict clear biblical doctrine (like the reality of sin, the nature of Christ's atonement, or the personality of God), this demonstrates the danger of adding extra-biblical authorities.",
    "output": "# Orthodox Christian Analysis of *Science and Health* as Authoritative Revelation\n\n## The Core Claim\n\nChristian Science holds that Mary Baker Eddy's *Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures* (1875) provides the definitive interpretation of Scripture and serves as a co-equal authority with the Bible in worship and study.\n\n## Orthodox Christian Concerns\n\n### 1. **The Sufficiency and Closed Canon of Scripture**\n\nOrthodox Christianity has historically maintained that the biblical canon is closed and sufficient for salvation and doctrine:\n\n- *\"All Scripture is God-breathed and useful for teaching...\"* (2 Timothy 3:16-17)\n- The Reformation principle of *sola scriptura* affirms Scripture as the final authority\n- Even traditions that value church teaching (Catholic, Orthodox) distinguish between Scripture and subsequent commentary\n\nAdding a 19th-century text as *equal* revelatory authority represents a significant departure.\n\n### 2. **Substantive Doctrinal Divergences**\n\n*Science and Health* teaches positions that conflict with historic Christian orthodoxy:\n\n- **Matter as illusion** — contradicts creation as \"very good\" (Genesis 1:31) and bodily resurrection\n- **Sin, sickness, and death as errors of mortal mind** — conflicts with biblical teaching on the Fall and redemption\n- **Reinterpretation of atonement** — moves away from substitutionary or participatory models\n\n### 3. **The Test of Consistency**\n\nOrthodox theology evaluates claimed revelations by their harmony with established Scripture (Galatians 1:8; 1 John 4:1).\n\n## A Fair Acknowledgment\n\nChristian Scientists sincerely believe Eddy's work *illuminates* rather than contradicts Scripture. They would argue she recovered original Christian healing practice.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFrom an orthodox perspective, *Science and Health* functions not as legitimate Christian commentary but as a new revelatory claim that substantially redefines core doctrines—placing it outside historic Christian boundaries while retaining Christian terminology.",

            "Core claim misrepresents Christian Science: The LLM describes Science and Health as a 'co-equal authority' with the Bible. While Christian Scientists view Science and Health as a guiding, authoritative interpretation of Scripture, most do not claim it is equal in status to Scripture or canonical. This overstatement distorts CS’s actual doctrinal posture.",
            "Misrepresentation of Orthodox position: The response frames Orthodox (and Catholic) authority as derived from 'sola scriptura' with tradition as a secondary commentary. Orthodox theology does not accept sola scriptura; it holds Scripture and Holy Tradition (with the teaching of the Church Fathers and Ecumenical Councils) as authoritative together. Treating Orthodoxy as endorsing sola scriptura gives a mistaken view of orthodox governance of doctrine.",
            "Other potential gaps not phrased as errors but worth noting: the answer does not engage with key Christian Scientist doctrines beyond the main points (e.g., the nature of God as Infinite Mind, the unreality of matter, and the particular soteriological framework in CS). Including those would strengthen accuracy and nuance."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer captures some orthodox critique (affirming Scriptural sufficiency, testing claims against Scripture) and notes a tension with CS’s teachings. However, it inaccurately portrays Christian Science as teaching a 'co-equal' authority with the Bible, which is contested by many CS sources, and it misstates Orthodox doctrine by invoking sola scriptura as a defining Orthodox principle. These two factual misrepresentations undermine overall accuracy, though the response does acknowledge some nuance and biblical grounding."
