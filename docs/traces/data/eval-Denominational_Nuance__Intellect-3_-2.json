    "expected": "Calvinism and Arminianism differ primarily on sovereignty and free will. Calvinists emphasize God's unconditional election, where God chooses who will be saved based solely on His will (TULIP: Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance of saints). Arminians emphasize that God's election is based on foreknowledge of who will freely choose faith, that Christ's atonement is unlimited, that grace can be resisted, and that believers can potentially lose salvation. Both affirm salvation by grace through faith and God's sovereignty, but differ on how divine sovereignty relates to human choice. Both views have been held by orthodox Christians throughout church history.",
    "output": "## Understanding Calvinism and Arminianism: A Comparative Overview\n\nAs a theologian committed to orthodoxy and respectful of diverse traditions, I'll explain the key differences between Calvinism and Arminianism. Both are profound attempts to understand God's work in salvation within the bounds of Scripture, affirming core truths like the Trinity, Christ's deity, his atoning death and resurrection, justification by grace through faith, and the final judgment. Their differences primarily lie in the interplay between divine sovereignty and human responsibility.\n\n**Historical Context:**\n\n*   **Calvinism:** Stemming from the theological system developed by John Calvin (1509-1564) in Geneva, building upon Augustine and the broader Reformed tradition. It emphasizes God's absolute sovereignty in salvation.\n*   **Arminianism:** Originating from the theology of Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609), a Dutch Reformed theologian who reacted against certain Calvinist emphases. After his death, his followers (the Remonstrants) formalized his views into five points contrasting with Calvinism.\n\n**Key Differences (Often Summarized in \"Five Points\"):**\n\n1.  **Total Depravity (Calvinism) vs. Partial Depravity (Arminianism):**\n    *   **Calvinism:** Humans are utterly incapable of any good towards God or salvation due to Adam's fall (Total Depravity). They are spiritually dead (Eph 2:1) and cannot respond to God without divine intervention. This doesn't deny common grace or human abilities in non-salvific matters.\n    *   **Arminianism:** While acknowledging the severe effects of sin (making humans *unable* to *initiate* a right relationship with God or *merit* salvation), humans retain a measure of free will (*liberum arbitrium*) and moral ability through prevenient grace. They are not *irresistibly* bound to sin; they can resist God's offer of salvation.\n\n2.  **Unconditional Election (Calvinism) vs. Conditional Election (Arminianism):**\n    *   **Calvinism:** God chooses individuals for salvation *unconditionally* (Eph 1:4-5, Rom 9:11-13). This choice is based solely on God's good pleasure and grace, not on any foreseen faith or merit in the individual. Election is the ultimate cause of salvation.\n    *   **Arminianism:** God's election is *conditional* upon His foreknowledge of individuals who would *freely* believe in Christ through prevenient grace (1 Pet 1:2, Rom 8:29). God's choice is based on His knowledge of their future response of faith. Election is the *result* of God foreseeing faith, not its cause.\n\n3.  **Limited Atonement (Calvinism) vs. Unlimited Atonement (Arminianism):**\n    *   **Calvinism:** Christ's atoning death was *intentionally* and *effectively* for the elect only (John 10:11, 15; 17:9, 12; Rom 8:32-34). While the *value* of Christ's sacrifice is infinite and sufficient for all, its *intended application* is specifically for those whom the Father gave Him. It is not a potential salvation offered to all that depends on human acceptance.\n    *   **Arminianism:** Christ's atonement was *potentially* for all people universally (1 John 2:2; 1 Tim 2:4, 6; Heb 2:9). It provides a *possibility* of salvation for every individual. Its effectiveness *for an individual* depends on their faith. The death removes the *obstacle* of sin for all, making salvation possible, but not necessarily applied to all.\n\n4.  **Irresistible Grace (Calvinism) vs. Resistible Grace (Arminianism):**\n    *   **Calvinism:** God's grace in regeneration (effectual calling) is *irresistible*. When God chooses to save someone, He effectually draws them to Christ through the Holy Spirit (John 6:37, 44; Rom 9:15-16). The spiritually dead person is made alive and *cannot refuse* this saving grace. This is \"monergism\" – God alone acts to bring about salvation.\n    *   **Arminianism:** God's prevenient grace *enables* but does not *compel* a free response. While God's grace is powerful and necessary, individuals retain the ability to *accept* or *resist* it (Acts 7:51; Heb 3:7-19; Rev 3:20). Salvation involves a \"synergism\" – God's enabling grace working *with* human free will.\n\n5.  **Perseverance of the Saints (Calvinism) vs. Conditional Security (Arminianism):**\n    *   **Calvinism:** Those whom God has elected, regenerated, and justified *will* persevere in faith to the end (John 10:27-30; Rom 8:28-39; Phil 1:6; 1 John 2:19). Their salvation is eternally secure because it is grounded in God's unchanging purpose and power, not their own faithfulness. True believers *cannot* lose their salvation.\n    *   **Arminianism:** While God desires believers to persevere (John 17:12, 15), their final salvation is *conditional* upon their continued faith and obedience (Col 1:21-23; Heb 3:14; 2 Pet 1:10-11). A true believer who finally falls away from faith demonstrates they were not truly regenerated (1 John 2:19) or loses their salvation through apostasy. Salvation is maintained by God's grace *and* the believer's cooperation.\n\n**Respecting Diversity, Affirming Orthodoxy:**\n\n*   **Core Agreement:** Both traditions affirm the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds, the authority of Scripture, salvation through faith in Christ alone (sola fide), the necessity of grace, and the ultimate purpose of salvation being God's glory.\n*   **Respecting the Tension:** The differences highlight a profound tension within Scripture itself between passages emphasizing God's absolute sovereignty (e.g., Rom 9) and passages emphasizing human responsibility and freedom (e.g., Deut 30:19; Josh 24:15; Ezek 18; Matt 23:37; Rev 22:17). Both traditions seek to do justice to the whole counsel of God.\n*   **Pastoral Implications:** These differences shape views on evangelism (Calvinism: preach the gospel to all; Arminianism: emphasize human decision), assurance of salvation (Calvinism: based on God's promise to the elect; Arminianism: based on present faithfulness), and the nature of God's love (Calvinism: particular love for the elect; Arminianism: universal love for all humanity).\n*   **Beyond the \"Five Points\":** It's crucial to remember these are summaries. Both traditions have broader theological frameworks (e.g., views on the sacraments, church government, the law) that can vary independently of these soteriological points. Not all who identify as \"Calvinist\" or \"Arminian\" hold every point rigidly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCalvinism and Arminianism represent two major, historically significant, and theologically rigorous approaches to understanding salvation within orthodox Christianity. Calvinism emphasizes God's absolute sovereignty and monergistic action, leading to unconditional election, particular redemption, and eternal security. Arminianism emphasizes human free will and synergism, leading to conditional election based on foreseen faith, universal atonement, resistible grace, and conditional security. Both systems grapple deeply with Scripture, seeking to honor God's sovereignty, human responsibility, and the centrality of Christ's work. While differing significantly on the mechanics of salvation, they share the core gospel message and operate within the bounds of historic Christian orthodoxy. The ongoing dialogue between these perspectives enriches theological understanding and challenges believers to a deeper appreciation of God's grace.",

In classic Arminian thought, depravity is described as 'total' in its effects, with prevenient grace enabling a prevenient response. The term 'partial depravity' is not standard and can mislead about the Arminian position.",
            "1 John 2:19 interpretation: The claim that apostasy proves a person was never truly regenerated reflects a Calvinist reading of the verse. Arminians typically argue that a true believer can apostasize yet still be genuinely saved in grace, or at least that perseverance is not guaranteed by divine decree. The verse is debated and not dispositive for the question of final perseverance.",
            "Rev 3:20 and other cited verses: Using Rev 3:20 (I stand at the door and knock) as evidence of resistible grace is a contested exegetical move. That verse speaks about Jesus’s invitation to individuals to open the door, but it is not universally interpreted as a proof-text for 'resistible grace' in soteriology. Some citations (e.g., Heb 3:7-19, Acts 7:51) are relevant to warnings against hardening or resisting the Spirit, but they do not unambiguously establish a single, uniform stance on the resistibility of grace across all contexts.)"

It is strong on historical framing, the language of monergism vs synergism, and the general contours of each position. However, a couple of specifics are potential points of inaccuracy or over-simplicity in common summaries: (1) Arminian depravity is typically described as total in effect with prevenient grace—not commonly termed 'partial depravity'; (2) 1 John 2:19 is a debated text in discussions of perseverance and can be read differently by Arminians vs. Calvinists; treating it as definitive proof against true regeneration reflects a Calvinist hermeneutic more than a universal Arminian reading; (3) Rev 3:20 is not a straightforward proof-text for "

However, it centers the discussion within Protestant Reformed debates and does not deeply engage Catholic or Orthodox perspectives on related doctrines (e.g., predestination, grace, perseverance).
