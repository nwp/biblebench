          "rationale": "The response accurately defines the hypostatic union as one person (a hypostasis) with two complete and distinct natures, fully divine and fully human, united without mixture or confusion and without division. It gives solid biblical grounding by citing key verses that affirm both natures (John 1:1-14; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:3 for deity; Luke 2:7; Matthew 4:2; John 19:28; Hebrews 4:15; Mark 15:37 for humanity) and a Christological claim that Jesus speaks and acts as both God and man (John 8:58). The Chalcedonian formula is correctly presented as one person in two natures, and the four adverbs (without confusion, without change, without division, without separation) are stated, including in the later portion the correct emphasis on each nature retaining its properties. The theological significance is standard: the union enables true representation and atoning value. Nuance is reasonably captured: emphasis on the unity of a single person and the preservation of each nature, along with perpetual union. Minor room for enhancement exists (the initial sentence could explicitly include all four Chalcedonian clauses, and the response could add further nuances such as the kenosis discussion and more explicit distinctions about the operation of the two natures in the incarnate Christ), but these do not undermine accuracy or orthodoxy."

It cites canonical sources (John 1:1–14; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:3; Luke 2:7; Matt 4:2; John 19:28; Hebrews 4:15; Mark 15:37) and references Chalcedon (451 AD) as defining the formula: one person in two natures; without confusion, without change, without division, without separation. It acknowledges the role of the hypostatic union for salvation (divine efficacy for atonement and human representation) and explicitly lists common heresies to watch for (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, etc.). No unorthodox teaching is evident. A minor editorial note: there is a stylistic duplication of the phrases "
