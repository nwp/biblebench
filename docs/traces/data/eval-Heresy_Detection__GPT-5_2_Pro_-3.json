          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the teacher’s claim as Docetism, a denial of the true humanity of Christ. It accurately states orthodox doctrine: the hypostatic union, that Jesus is fully God and fully human, and that the Incarnation involved a real human body. It cites and aligns with key biblical passages (John 1:14; Luke 24:39; Hebrews 2:14; 1 John 4:2–3; 2 John 7) that oppose docetism, and it notes the historical creeds (Nicene-Constantinople, Chalcedon) and patristic witness (Ignatius). The analysis also explains the theological consequences if the Incarnation were not real (suffering, death, resurrection, and salvation would be undermined). It demonstrates appropriate nuance by distinguishing true Incarnation from mere appearances and by situating the issue within historical orthodoxy. A minor enhancement could be a tighter quotation of the Chalcedonian formula, but it does not constitute doctrinal error."
