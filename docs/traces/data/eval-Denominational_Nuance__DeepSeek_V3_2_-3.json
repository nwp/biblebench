    "expected": "Catholic and Orthodox traditions view church tradition as equally authoritative with Scripture, believing the church's teaching authority (magisterium in Catholicism) reliably interprets both. Protestants hold to 'sola scriptura' - Scripture alone as the final authority, though they value historical creeds and confessions as subordinate standards. Anglicans often take a middle position, valuing tradition and reason alongside Scripture (the 'three-legged stool'). These differences affect views on everything from papal authority to how doctrines develop. Despite differences, all agree Scripture is essential and authoritative.",
    "output": "# Church Tradition and Authority Across Christian Traditions\n\n**Roman Catholicism** holds that Sacred Tradition (capital T) and Sacred Scripture together form the single deposit of faith, with the Magisterium (the teaching authority of bishops in communion with the Pope) as their authentic interpreter. The Pope possesses supreme, full, immediate, and universal ordinary power when speaking *ex cathedra* on matters of faith and morals (papal infallibility). Tradition develops under the guidance of the Holy Spirit through ecumenical councils, papal decrees, and the consensus of the faithful.\n\n**Eastern Orthodoxy** views Holy Tradition as the totality of the Church's life—Scripture, liturgical worship, patristic writings, conciliar decisions, icons, and canonical discipline—all expressing the one apostolic faith preserved unchanged. Authority resides in the collective episcopate, with ecumenical councils (seven accepted) as the highest expression of conciliarity. The Orthodox reject papal supremacy while honoring the Patriarch of Constantinople as \"first among equals.\"\n\n**Anglicanism/Episcopalianism** maintains the \"three-legged stool\" of Scripture, Tradition, and Reason, though with varying emphases across its spectrum. The *Book of Common Prayer* embodies liturgical tradition, while bishops provide apostolic continuity. Authority is dispersed among Scripture, ancient creeds, early councils, and ongoing dialogue, with national or provincial autonomy limiting centralized authority.\n\n**Lutheranism** upholds *sola Scriptura*—Scripture as the sole infallible authority—but respects tradition as a witness to scriptural interpretation, especially the ecumenical creeds and Lutheran Confessions. Tradition serves when it aligns with Scripture but is rejected when it contradicts the gospel. Church authority exists to proclaim God's Word, not to establish new doctrines.\n\n**Reformed/Presbyterian** traditions emphasize Scripture's supreme authority (*sola Scriptura*) and view tradition as fallible human interpretation. The Westminster Confession states that \"the Supreme Judge... can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture.\" Church councils may err; ecclesiastical authority is ministerial rather than magisterial, exercised through presbyterian polity.\n\n**Baptist and many Free Church** traditions typically hold a stricter *sola Scriptura* position, viewing tradition with cautious respect but ultimate suspicion. Local congregations are autonomous under Christ's lordship, with Scripture as the final authority. Creeds and confessions are considered subordinate documents, revisable in light of biblical understanding.\n\n**Pentecostal and Charismatic** movements often prioritize immediate spiritual experience and biblical interpretation under the Holy Spirit's guidance. While valuing apostolic tradition, they tend to be wary of institutionalized tradition that might quench the Spirit's ongoing work. Authority often resides in local pastoral leadership alongside prophetic gifts.\n\n**Common Orthodox Core:** All major traditions affirm the authority of Scripture, the ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene), and the basic Trinitarian and Christological consensus of the early Church. They recognize some form of apostolic succession—whether understood as doctrinal continuity (all traditions), episcopal lineage (Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican), or faithfulness to apostolic teaching (Protestant).\n\nThese differences fundamentally concern **how divine revelation is mediated and authenticated**—whether through an unbroken teaching office, conciliar consensus, confessional standards, or the Spirit-illumined reading of Scripture by the believing community. Each represents a conscientious attempt to balance continuity with Christian origins and responsiveness to the Holy Spirit's ongoing guidance.",

            "Overgeneralization about apostolic succession: The response suggests that all major traditions affirm some form of apostolic succession (doctrinal continuity, episcopal lineage, or faithfulness to apostolic teaching). In Protestant already, especially some streams (e.g., many Reformed and some Baptists) do not acknowledge episcopal apostolic succession as a criterion for ordination or apostolic continuity in the same sense as Catholic/Orthodox use of it.",
            "Misrepresentation of Anglican/Protestant diversity: The statement that Anglicanism provides ‘apostolic continuity’ through bishops and that national autonomy limits centralized authority is a broad simplification. Anglican governance and authority structures vary widely by province, and some Anglicans emphasize via media, synods, and a more complex balance between scripture, tradition, and reason.",
            "Lutheran/confessional nuance: The claim that Lutheranism upholds ‘sola Scriptura—Scripture as the sole infallible authority’ is commonly stated, but Lutherans typically affirm the authority of the ecumenical creeds and the Lutheran Confessions as authoritative explanations of Scripture. The use of ‘infallible’ for Scripture can be misleading in Lutheran contexts, where infallibility is not commonly described in the same Catholic-Ratified sense.",
            "Potentially misleading aura around infallibility: The Catholic claim of papal infallibility (ex cathedra) is technically restricted to very specific doctrinal circumstances (faith and morals, as defined by Vatican I) and is not asserted for all papal utterances. The phrasing here could imply a broader universal application than is standard in Catholic teaching."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer overall aligns with historical summaries of how major traditions view church tradition and authority, and it captures key distinctions (Catholic/Orthodox emphasis on Tradition with Scripture, Protestant sola Scriptura, Anglican via media, etc.). The strongest area needing nuance is the claim about apostolic succession and its acceptance across all traditions. Protestant groups generally reject the episcopal form of apostolic succession as a criterion for authority, while Catholics, Orthodox, and many Anglicans hold some form of apostolic continuity. There are also nuanced differences within Protestant families (Lutheran, Reformed, Baptist, Pentecostal) regarding where authority resides and how tradition relates to Scripture. Some statements could be refined for precision (e.g., Lutherans’ confessional authority versus “sole infallible” Scriptural authority, and the exact scope of papal infallibility). Despite these caveats, the response provides a solid, mostly accurate survey of how traditions view tradition and authority, and it effectively highlights the ongoing conversation about how divine revelation is mediated, authenticated, and interpreted in different contexts."

It avoids privileging a single tradition, explicitly contrasts key positions (papal authority vs. conciliar/episcopal structures, sola Scriptura vs. tradition), and concludes with a balanced summary about how revelation is mediated. Minor areas for nuance could be expanded (e.g., the breadth within Anglicanism or Baptist confessional diversity), but there is no clear favoritism or definitive assertion of one view over others."
