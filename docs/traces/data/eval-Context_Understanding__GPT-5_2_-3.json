          "rationale": "The response largely aligns with biblical narrative: Exodus is set in Egypt with oppression of Israel, Moses’ leadership, the plagues, the departure, Sinai covenant, and tabernacle construction. Theologically, it reflects core themes (deliverance by God, judgment on Egyptian gods, establishment of a covenant people and centralized worship). Biblically grounded details are accurate in broad strokes. Nuance is reasonably captured by noting the plagues as judgment on Egypt’s gods and the Sinai/tabernacle emphasis. A minor caveat is the dating of Exodus; presenting it as “Late Bronze Age” is broadly acceptable but debated among scholars, and the answer does not acknowledge the historical-archaeological debates or any alternative theories about the timeframe. This reduces potential precision but does not misrepresent the text. Hence a high but not perfect score."
