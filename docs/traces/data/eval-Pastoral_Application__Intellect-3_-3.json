    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "My dear friend, I'm so deeply sorry for the profound loss you've experienced. The pain of losing a child is one of life's most devastating wounds, and your heartache is completely valid in the eyes of both heaven and earth.\n\nThe question you've asked cuts to the core of our faith: How can a loving God permit such tragedy? This is the same cry that resonated through history, from the psalmist's lament to Jesus' own anguish in Gethsemane. Your honest struggle is not a sign of weak faith but of a searching heart that deserves compassion, not pat answers.\n\nScripture offers us the profound mystery of divine sovereignty and human freedom intertwined. God does not delight in death but desires life (Deuteronomy 30:19). The psalmist reminds us that \"the Lord is close to the brokenhearted\" (Psalm 34:18), not as a distant deity who decrees tragedy but as a Father who grieves with us.\n\nWhile Scripture teaches that God can bring good out of suffering (Romans 8:28), this is not a flippant explanation for why tragedy occurs. The promise of Romans 8:28 is not a shallow silver lining but a profound declaration that God's redemptive power can work through human brokenness.\n\nIn the face of such mystery, I encourage you to:\n- Rest in God's presence rather than demanding explanation (Isaiah 55:8-9)\n- Express your raw feelings honestly to God, as David did in the Psalms\n- Lean on Christ, who wept at Lazarus' tomb (John 11:35), showing God's empathy in grief\n- Remember that death is not God's final word—resurrection is (1 Corinthians 15:20-26)\n- Allow your faith community to surround and support you (Galatians 6:2)\n\nYour child's death is not part of God's perfect will but a consequence of living in a broken world. Yet even in this tragedy, God is present, offering comfort that transcends understanding (Philippians 4:7) and working to bring healing and purpose beyond what we can presently see.\n\nMay you find solace in the promise that your child now knows no more tears, no more sorrow, and no more pain—a promise that one day will be fully realized for all creation (Revelation 21:4). Until that day, may you feel the arms of Christ holding you in your grief, the presence of the Spirit sustaining you, and the prayers of the church surrounding you.\n\nPlease know that your journey through grief is not one you walk alone. The Good Shepherd walks beside you in the valley of the shadow of death, and He will guide you through this darkness into His glorious light.",

The response could be clearer about the distinction between what God permits and what He decrees, to avoid implying God is uninvolved or purely reactive in tragedy."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer generally aligns with orthodox Christian teaching on sovereignty, the problem of evil, lament, nearness of God, and resurrection hope. It emphasizes that tragedy occurs in a fallen world, not as a desired outcome of God, and it points to Scripture (Psalm 34:18; John 11:35; Rom. 8:28; 1 Cor. 15; Isa. 55:8–9; Gal. 6:2; Phil. 4:7; Rev. 21:4). It also encourages lament, communal support, and trust in God’s presence. A minor theological nuance missing or under-emphasized is a precise treatment of the distinction between God’s sovereign will and God’s permissive will, which can lead to confusion about whether God actively willed the death or allowed it within a fallen order. The response otherwise captures important distinctions and offers a compassionate, biblically grounded pastoral approach."
