    "output": "Short answer: it depends on what you mean by “error” and on your theological assumptions. Scholars, theologians and readers disagree.\n\nKey perspectives\n- Classical inerrancy (many conservative Protestants): the Bible, in the original autographs, affirms no errors in anything it teaches (doctrine, history, science). Apparent contradictions are resolvable by careful study of language, genre and context.\n- Infallibility/limited inerrancy: the Bible is fully reliable for faith and practice (what it affirms about God, salvation, morals), but not necessarily free from incidental historical or scientific imprecision that reflects its ancient context.\n- Critical/scholarly view: the Bible is a collection of ancient documents with theological aims; it contains historical, chronological and factual mistakes, later additions, and contradictions, like any body of ancient literature.\n\nConcrete kinds of issues people point to\n- Textual variants / later additions: some passages are absent from the earliest manuscripts (e.g., John 7:53–8:11, the story of the woman caught in adultery; the longer ending of Mark 16; the Comma Johanneum in 1 John 5:7 is a later addition). These are problems of transmission, not necessarily of original content.\n- Contradictory or differing accounts: the genealogies of Jesus in Matthew and Luke differ in names and structure; the four Gospels give different details of the resurrection events; Judas’ death is described differently in Matthew 27:5 (hanged) and Acts 1:18 (falling and bursting).\n- Numerical/chronological problems: differing census totals and regnal-year chronologies (e.g., 2 Samuel / 1 Chronicles census numbers, dating of the census of Quirinius in Luke 2) raise questions for historians.\n- Historical/archaeological debates: large-scale Exodus and conquest as described in some biblical passages are not straightforwardly corroborated by contemporary archaeology; scholars debate the historicity and scale.\n- Ancient worldview or “science”: some biblical passages reflect an ancient cosmology (e.g., poetic language about the earth’s foundations or the firmament). Many readers treat these as metaphorical or phenomenological language rather than scientific claims.\n- Moral issues: commands and depictions that modern readers find troubling (e.g., slavery regulations, commands to destroy peoples) raise ethical questions; some see these as culturally conditioned, others as problematic.\n\nHow defenders respond\n- Genre and intent: much of Scripture is narrative, poetry, prophecy or parable. Expect different standards of reporting and truth claims than modern historiography or science.\n- Harmonization: claimed contradictions can often be reconciled when you account for perspective, chronology, idiom, or manuscript variants.\n- Inspiration as accommodation: God communicated through ancient authors in their cultural-linguistic frameworks; apparent “errors” reflect human modes of expression rather than theological failure.\n- Autographs vs. copies: many who hold inerrancy restrict it to the original autographs (which are no longer extant); textual criticism seeks to recover them.\n\nA balanced take\n- If you approach the Bible as an ancient library of religious literature, you will find both profound theological insight and a number of historical/textual tensions that deserve critical attention.\n- If you already accept doctrinal inerrancy, you will generally view the Bible as ultimately free from error and seek harmonizations or rely on doctrinal categories (e.g., inspiration, genre).\n- Most readers and scholars occupy a middle ground: they value the Bible’s theological and moral teaching while acknowledging textual variants and some historical or scientific tensions.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Give detailed examples and how scholars on both sides handle them (e.g., Judas’ death, the census of Quirinius).\n- Explain how textual criticism establishes which passages are later additions.\n- Unpack the theological arguments for/against inerrancy.
