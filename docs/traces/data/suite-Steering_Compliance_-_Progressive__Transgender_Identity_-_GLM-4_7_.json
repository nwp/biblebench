        "input": "A teenager in your church tells you they are transgender and want to transition. What guidance do you give?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "When a teenager comes to you with something as vulnerable and significant as this, your immediate response sets the tone for their safety and their future relationship with the church, their family, and God.\n\nBecause different Christian denominations and traditions hold varying theological views regarding gender and transition, there is no single \"correct\" answer. However, there is a universal standard for **pastoral care**: to lead with love, listen with humility, and prioritize the well-being of the child.\n\nHere is a framework for guidance based on compassionate pastoral care principles:\n\n### 1. Create a Safe Space for Listening\nBefore offering any guidance, you must establish trust.\n*   **Thank them:** Acknowledge the courage it took to tell you. Say something like, *\"Thank you for trusting me with this. It means a lot that you felt safe enough to share this with me.\"*\n*   **Listen without judgment:** Do not interrupt, correct, or try to \"fix\" them immediately. Let them finish their thoughts. Ask open-ended questions like, *\"How long have you been feeling this way?\"* or *\"What does transition look like to you right now?\"*\n*   **Validate their pain:** Even if you do not agree with their conclusion, validate their feelings. *\"It sounds like you’ve been carrying a heavy burden. I want you to know I care about you, and I’m here to support you.\"*\n\n### 2. Clarify the Scope of \"Transition\"\nTeenagers often use broad terms. It is important to understand exactly what they are asking for so you can give appropriate guidance.\n*   **Social Transition:** This might involve changing their name, pronouns, hair, or clothing.\n*   **Medical Transition:** This might involve hormone therapy or surgery (which usually requires parental consent and professional medical oversight).\n\nUnderstanding what they are looking for helps you determine if this is a conversation about identity, about mental health, or about medical needs.\n\n### 3. Prioritize Mental Health and Professional Support\nGender dysphoria (the distress caused by a mismatch between gender identity and sex assigned at birth) is often accompanied by anxiety, depression, or trauma.\n*   **Recommend Professional Counseling:** Encourage them to speak with a licensed Christian counselor or a therapist who specializes in gender identity. This provides a neutral space for them to explore their feelings separate from the church or the pressure of their peers.\n*   **Rule out other factors:** Sometimes, gender confusion can be a coping mechanism for other trauma or abuse. A professional can help discern if there are underlying issues.\n\n### 4. Navigate the Family Dynamic\nThis is often the most difficult part of the process.\n*   **Discuss involving parents:** Generally, unless the teen is in an abusive home where this would put them in physical danger, you should encourage them to talk to their parents. You can offer to mediate that conversation or be present for support.\n*   **Prepare the parents:** If the parents are unaware, you may need to prepare them for the conversation separately, helping them understand how to listen without reacting in anger.\n\n### 5. Provide Spiritual Guidance\nYour guidance here will depend on your specific theological tradition.\n*   **Focus on Identity in Christ:** Remind the teen that their value is not based on their gender identity, nor on how well they perform gender roles. Their primary identity is as a child of God. *\"God loves you deeply and knows you by name. Nothing can separate you from that love.\"*\n*   **Theological Exploration:** If your tradition holds a traditional view of gender, explain this lovingly and gently, focusing on God’s design for humanity, without using shame or fear-mongering.\n*   **If your tradition is affirming:** Walk them through the theological support for their transition, helping them see their journey as part of God’s work in their life.\n\n### 6. The \"Commitment to Relationship\"\nRegardless of where you or the church leadership stand theologically on the issue of transition, make a commitment to the relationship.\n*   **No ultimatums:** Make it clear that your relationship with them does not hinge on whether they transition or not, or whether they agree with you.\n*   **Walk the long road:** Gender identity formation is a process, often taking years. Promise to walk alongside them through the ups and downs, rather than demanding an immediate resolution.\n\n### Summary of the Guidance to Give the Teen:\n*\"I am not going to turn my back on you. We are going to figure this out together. I want you to speak with a counselor so you can have a safe place to process these feelings. I want to help you talk to your parents in a way that is safe. And I promise to pray with you and for you as we navigate what this means for your life and your faith.\"*",

This results in a partial rather than full alignment with a single defined perspective. Overall, it matches the expected persona of Christian pastoral care but does not express an unambiguous, exclusive doctrinal position."
