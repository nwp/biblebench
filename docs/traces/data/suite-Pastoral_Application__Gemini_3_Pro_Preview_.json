        "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
        "output": "My dear friend,\n\nFirst, I want you to take a deep breath. I want to thank you for trusting me with this. I can see the fear and heaviness in your eyes, and I want to validate that your pain is real. As parents, our deepest desire is to see our children walk in the truth (3 John 1:4), and when that seems threatened, it feels like our world is crumbling.\n\nBut I want to offer you four anchors to hold onto—anchors grounded in who God is and how He works.\n\n### 1. Do not panic; God is not surprised.\n\nIt is natural to feel devastated, but we must not let fear drive our response. God knew this moment would come before your daughter was even born. He is not unsettled by her questions, and He is not intimidated by her doubts.\n\nRemember, salvation is of the Lord (Jonah 2:9). You have been faithful to plant seeds, but you cannot make them grow; only God can do that (1 Corinthians 3:6-7). This is a crucial moment for you to surrender the burden of being her Savior. You are her parent; Jesus is the Savior. He loves her infinitely more than you do, and He has been pursuing hearts for eternity.\n\nOften, what we see as a terrifying crisis of faith is actually a necessary \"deconstruction\" of a childhood faith so that a robust, adult faith can be built. She cannot survive on your faith forever; she must wrestle to find her own.\n\n### 2. Move from \"Preaching\" to \"Listening.\"\n\nWhen we are scared, our instinct is to lecture. We want to argue them back into the Kingdom. We want to pour every apologetics argument we know onto them. But right now, she doesn't need a lecturer; she needs a safe harbor.\n\nJames 1:19 tells us to be \"quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.\"\n\nAsk her questions. Ask her, \"What makes you feel that way?\" or \"Is there a specific teaching that is bothering you?\" or \"Are you hurting?\" Often, intellectual doubts are masks for emotional pain or disappointment with the church.\n\nIf you react with anger, tears, or panic every time she brings up a doubt, she will stop talking to you. You want to be the safest place in the world for her to voice her confusion. If she can bring her darkness to the light of your kitchen table, the enemy loses his power to isolate her.\n\n### 3. Maintain the Relationship at all costs.\n\nThere is a temptation to withdraw affection or to make every interaction about religion. Please, do not do this. Paul instructs us that it is God’s *kindness* that leads to repentance (Romans 2:4).\n\nLove her extravagantly. Go out for ice cream. Watch movies together. Help her with her homework. Let her see that your love for her is not conditional on her spiritual performance. This mirrors the love of the Father in the parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15). Even when the son was far off, the father was watching and waiting, not shaming.\n\nIf you burn the bridge of relationship, the truck of truth cannot drive over it. Keep the bridge intact.\n\n### 4. Pray with confidence, not despair.\n\nThis is your greatest weapon. When you talk to her, you may stumble over your words. But when you talk to the Father, you are heard in the throne room of Heaven.\n\nPray Philippians 1:6 over her: *\"And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.\"*\n\nPray that God would send other believers into her life—sometimes a teenager needs to hear the truth from a youth leader, a mentor, or a peer rather than a parent.\n\n### A Closing Encouragement\n\nMy friend, you are not a failure because your daughter is questioning. This is not a report card on your parenting. This is a spiritual battle and a spiritual journey.\n\nJude 1:22 tells us to *\"Have mercy on those who doubt.\"* Treat her doubt with mercy, not judgment.\n\nI am here for you. I am here for her if she ever wants to talk to someone outside the family, but let’s not force that. For now, go home, love your daughter, listen to her heart, and trust that the Good Shepherd knows exactly where His lamb has wandered. He is able to bring her home.\n\nLet’s pray together right now.",

Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
        "output": "Thank you for trusting me enough to walk through that door and share what is burdening your heart. It takes immense courage to voice these questions, and I want you to know that this office is a safe place. You are met here not with judgment, but with the same grace that I, and every other believer, desperately need every day.\n\nYou have asked two very deep, painful questions. Let’s sit together with them, opening God's Word to find our footing.\n\n### \"Does God hate me?\"\n\nLet me answer this immediately and unequivocally: **No.**\n\nGod does not hate you. In fact, the very opposite is true. We see in Scripture that God is the Creator of every human soul, and He loves what He has made. But the ultimate proof of His love isn't found in how we feel about ourselves; it is found in the Cross.\n\nRomans 5:8 tells us, *\"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\"*\n\nNotice that verse doesn't say \"Once we had everything figured out\" or \"Once we stopped wrestling with broken desires.\" It says *while* we were sinners. If you are in Christ, God’s affection for you is set on you because of Jesus. He looks at you and sees His beloved child.\n\nIt is true that God hates *sin*—He hates it because it distorts His image in us and separates us from Him. But we must distinguish between the person and the fallenness that affects us all. Satan, the \"accuser of the brethren,\" wants you to equate your temptations with your identity. He wants you to believe you are disqualified from love. But the Gospel says you are fearfully and wonderfully made, and deeply loved, even while you are in the midst of the struggle.\n\n### \"Can I be a Christian and experience these feelings?\"\n\nThe short answer is: **Yes.**\n\nTo understand this, we have to make a vital biblical distinction between *temptation* (or attraction) and *sin*.\n\nHebrews 4:15 tells us that we have a High Priest (Jesus) who is *\"sympathetic to our weaknesses\"* and was *\"tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.\"*\n\nIf Jesus was tempted and yet was without sin, then the experience of temptation itself—the involuntary arrival of a feeling or desire—is not the same as sinning. Sin happens when we welcome that desire, dwell on it, cultivate it, or act upon it (James 1:14-15).\n\nBeing a Christian does not mean you suddenly stop experiencing broken desires.\n*   The Christian who struggles with anger still feels the flash of rage.\n*   The Christian who struggles with greed still feels the pull of materialism.\n*   And the Christian who encounters same-sex attraction still feels that pull.\n\nWe live in a fallen world, and our bodies and minds are subject to the \"groaning\" of creation (Romans 8:23). Your attractions are a result of the Fall, just as sickness or pride are. They are not what God designed, but experiencing them does not mean you are not His.\n\nActually, the fact that you are *conflicted* by these feelings—that you are asking these questions and desiring to honor God—is often an evidence of the Holy Spirit at work in you. A heart that is dead in sin rarely worries about pleasing God. The warfare you feel is the battle between the Spirit and the flesh that Galatians 5 talks about.\n\n### Your Identity and Your Walk\n\nHere is the difficult, yet liberating truth: While you can be a Christian and have these feelings, the call of Christ is to submit *all* feelings to His Lordship.\n\nOur culture tells you that your sexual desires are who you *are*. It says you must act on them to be authentic. Jesus offers a different path. He says that you are who *He* says you are. You are not your sexuality. You are a child of God, bought with a price.\n\nThis means that while the *feelings* may persist, we are called to a life of holiness. Scripture is clear that God’s design for sexual intimacy is reserved for the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6). This is a hard teaching in our current age, and perhaps a heavy cross to carry. But Jesus promises that His yoke is easy and His burden is light—not because the commands are easy, but because He carries the weight with us.\n\nSo, how do we walk this out?\n\n1.  **Don't Identify by your Attemptations:** You are not a \"Gay Christian\" in the sense that your sexuality defines your core nature; you are a Christian—a follower of Jesus—who experiences same-sex attraction. Your identity is hidden in Christ (Colossians 3:3).\n2.  **Bring it into the Light:** Shame grows in the dark. By talking to me, you’ve broken the power of secrecy. Continue to seek community. You need brothers and sisters who will remind you of the Gospel, not condemn you.\n3.  **Focus on Holiness, not Heterosexuality:** Sometimes people think the goal is to become \"straight.\" The goal of the Christian life is to become *holy* and like Jesus. Whether your feelings change or not (and for some they do, for others they don't), your calling is faithfulness to Christ today.\n\n### A Closing Thought\n\nMy friend, you are entering a battle, but you do not fight alone. Please do not let the enemy convince you that your struggle puts you outside the camp of God’s grace.\n\nThe Apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians, listing many struggles including sexual ones, and he said, *\"And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God\"* (1 Corinthians 6:11).\n\nYou are washed. You are loved.\nLet us pray together that God will give you the strength to walk in obedience, and the comfort of knowing you are His.\n\n*Shall we pray?*",

It correctly notes that sexual intimacy is designed for heterosexual marriage (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6) and that Christians may experience ongoing struggles with unwanted desires, including same-sex attraction, while remaining faithful to Christ. The response grounds its main claims in Scripture and maintains a pastoral, pastoral-tone approach, including encouragement to seek community and wise counsel, and a gospel-centered view of love and discipline through the cross (Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 6:11). \n\nNuance-wise, the answer treats temptation as not inherently sinful and emphasizes the need to submit desires to Christ, which is a sound distinction. However, it could better acknowledge the broader spectrum of Christian views on sexuality and relationships, including some traditions that accept committed same-sex relationships or differ on celibacy as a path for believers with SSA. The response implicitly assumes the traditional heterosexual-marriage ethic and does not explicitly discuss a pastoral path (e.g., celibacy as a distinct vocation) beyond general holiness, which slightly limits its scope of nuance. Overall, no theological errors are present, and the core claims are biblically grounded and doctrinally orthodox."

        "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
        "output": "It is good that you are here. The very fact that you are asking this question tells me that the Holy Spirit is active in your lives, prompting you to examine your choices in light of your faith. You are seeking to honor God, and that is a beautiful starting point.\n\nI want to answer you not with a list of rigid rules, but by looking at God’s grand and beautiful design for marriage. I know you love each other, and I can see you are serious about your future. Because of that, I want to give you counsel that protects that future and honors the One who brought you together.\n\nTo answer your question directly: While it is culturally normal, living together before marriage is not God's best for you, nor is it consistent with the biblical pattern for Christian men and women.\n\nLet’s walk through \"why\" together.\n\n### 1. The Design of Marriage: Covenant before Consummation\nIn Genesis 2:24, we see the blueprint for marriage: *\"Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.\"*\n\nNotice the order: Leaving (parents), Cleaving (covenant commitment), and then Becoming One Flesh (sexual intimacy and shared life). Living together attempts to reverse this order. It seeks the privileges of intimacy and shared life without the security and binding nature of the public covenant.\n\nIn Scripture, marriage is not just a piece of paper or a private feeling of commitment. It is a public vow before God and witnesses. It is the \"safe house\" God built for the vulnerability of total intimacy. When we play house without the vow, we are acting out the oneness of marriage without the covering of covenant protection.\n\n### 2. The Call to Be Distinct\nYou mentioned that \"everyone does it now.\" You are right; the culture has shifted. But as followers of Jesus, our standard has never been culture; our standard is Christ.\n\nPaul writes in Romans 12:2, *\"Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind.\"* The world views marriage as a contract rooted in convenience and compatibility testing. The Christian views marriage as a covenant rooted in sacrificial love and holiness.\n\nIf your relationship looks exactly like the world’s, how does it point to Christ? Your marriage is meant to be a picture of Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5). Christ did not \"test drive\" the Church; He gave Himself up for her to make her holy. By waiting, you are telling the world that your trust in God and your reverence for marriage is stronger than cultural pressure or financial convenience.\n\n### 3. Fleeing Temptation\nScripture is realistic about human drive. 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4 tells us, *\"For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor.\"*\n\nIf you are living together and sleeping together, you are engaging in the privileges of marriage without the covenant of marriage. Biblically, this falls under *porneia* (sexual immorality). If you are living together but *not* sleeping together, you are putting yourselves in a furnace of temptation that God commands us to flee. It is unwise to place yourselves in a situation where the struggle for purity is constant and overwhelming.\n\nFurthermore, we must consider our witness. Even if you maintain purity, living together creates the appearance of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22). It confuses your witness to neighbors or younger believers who look to you as examples.\n\n### 4. The Myth of the \"Test Drive\"\nThere is a practical belief that living together prevents divorce because you \"get to know the person.\" Sociologically, statistics actually suggest the opposite: couples who cohabit before engagement often have higher rates of divorce or lower marital satisfaction.\n\nWhy? Because cohabitation creates a \"sliding vs. deciding\" dynamic. You slide into marriage because the lease is up or you share furniture, rather than making a sharp, intentional decision to bind yourselves to one another. God wants your marriage to be built on intentional commitment, not inertia.\n\n### Pastoral Counsel: What Now?\n\nI know this is hard to hear. I know that moving apart is expensive, inconvenient, and feels like a step backward relationally. But obedience to God often comes with a cost—and that cost is always an investment in joy.\n\nHere is my challenge to you: **If you are truly committed to each other, honor that commitment by doing it God's way.**\n\n1.  **Separate your living situation.** I know this is a heavy ask. It might mean moving in with a friend, a distinct roommate situation, or moving back with family for a season. If finances are the only barrier, let the church know; the body of Christ is here to help those seeking to walk in holiness.\n2.  **Set a date.** If you are committed, why wait? If you know this is the person you want to marry, let’s move toward the altar. Biblical marriage doesn't require a $30,000 party; it requires a man, a woman, an officiant, and vows.\n3.  **Repent and Refresh.** If you have fallen into sexual intimacy, bring that to the Cross. There is no shame for those who are in Christ Jesus. Receive His forgiveness, and let that grace empower you to walk in purity from today until your wedding night.\n\nYou are asking, \"Is this really wrong?\" I would flip the question: \"Is this really God's best?\"\n\nI believe you want God’s blessing on your marriage. God loves to bless obedience. I urge you to trust Him, make the hard decision to move apart, and prepare for your marriage the right way. You will never regret honoring God, and you will one day tell your children and grandchildren that you loved God and each other enough to wait.\n\nI am here to walk this with you. Let’s pray.",

It highlights the witness implications (Eph 5; Rom 12:2) and emphasizes grace and repentance rather than judgment, which is pastorally appropriate. The response also offers practical, pastoral steps (separation or moving toward marriage, accountability, and prayer) and acknowledges cultural pressures. It notes the common claim of “test drive” is sociologically contested with a fair presentation of the potential risks, and it remains clear that obedience to God’s design is the path to flourishing. While it could have quoted 1 Cor 6:18-20 explicitly and nuanced scenarios where premarital abstinence might be pursued in limited circumstances, there are no doctrinal errors. Overall, the answer is biblically grounded, theologically sound, and nuanced in its pastoral approach."

        "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
        "output": "My dear friend,\n\nI am so deeply, deeply sorry. There are no words I can say that will take away the crushing weight in your chest right now. Before we look at theology or Scripture, I want to sit with you in the ashes of this grief. I want to weep with you, just as Scripture commands us to mourn with those who mourn.\n\nYou have asked a question that is torn from the very bottom of your soul, and you deserve an honest answer, not a spiritual cliché.\n\nWhen people say, “It was God’s will” or “Everything happens for a reason,” they are usually trying to make sense of the senseless. They often speak out of their own fear, trying to paste a simple label on a tragedy because the chaos such loss represents is terrifying. But in doing so, they have unintentionally painted a picture of God that looks like a monster.\n\nIf \"God's will\" means that God reached down, pushed a car off the road, and took your child because He needed another angel, or because He wanted to teach you a lesson, then I reject that theology, and I believe Scripture does too.\n\nHere is how we can walk through this together, holding onto both truth and grace.\n\n**1. Death is an Intruder, not a Blueprint**\nThe Bible is very clear that death is an enemy. In 1 Corinthians 15:26, Paul calls death \"the last enemy.\" God did not create the world to have car accidents, cancer, or funerals. These things entered the world through the fracture of sin and the brokenness of creation.\n\nWhen your child died, God was not sitting in heaven checking a box on a cold master plan. His heart was breaking. We see this most clearly in Jesus. When Jesus stood at the tomb of his friend Lazarus, even though He knew He was about to raise him, He did not say, \"Well, everything happens for a reason.\" Scripture says, \"Jesus wept\" (John 11:35). He felt the horror of death in his gut. He was angry at the pain death causes.\n\nGod’s \"will\" is not always a specific script of tragedy that He authors; rather, we live in a world where freedom, physics, and human error collide. God allows these natural laws to exist, but He does not delight in the death of the living (Ezekiel 33:11).\n\n**2. God’s Permission vs. God’s Desire**\nWe must distinguish between what God *permits* in His sovereignty and what God *desires* in His heart.\n\nGod is sovereign, meaning nothing happens outside of His knowledge or power. But Scripture teaches that God *does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone* (Lamentations 3:33). He permitted this accident in the mystery of a fallen world, but He did not commit it with malice. He is not a puppet master pulling strings of destruction; He is the Sustainer who holds you while the world crumbles.\n\n**3. Redeeming is Different than Causing**\nThe phrase \"Everything happens for a reason\" is not in the Bible. What *is* in the Bible is Romans 8:28: *\"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him...\"*\n\nNotice the difference. It does not say \"all things *are* good.\" Death is not good. The accident was not good. It does not say \"God caused all things.\" It says God *works in* all things.\n\nThis means that God is so powerful and so loving that He refuses to let this tragedy have the final word. He takes the jagged, terrible shards of this pain and promises to weave them, eventually, into a redemption we cannot yet see. But that does not mean He caused the accident just to teach you something. Your child was not a pawn in a cosmic lesson.\n\n**4. Permission to Lament**\nYou asked, \"How can a loving God will my child's death?\" The answer is that the loving God is arguably more grieved by the unnaturalness of death than you are. He hates it so much that He sent His own Son to die in order to destroy it.\n\nRight now, your task is not to defend God or figure out the \"reason.\" Your task is to lament. Read the Psalms—nearly a third of them are angry cries to God. Psalm 88 ends with the words, *\"Darkness is my closest friend.\"* God included that in the Bible so you would know that your anger, confusion, and darkness are allowed in His presence. You can scream at heaven. God is big enough to handle your grief.\n\n**Pastoral Counsel for the Days Ahead:**\n\n*   **Filter the Voices:** You have my permission to gently ignore those who offer platitudes. When they say, \"It's God's will,\" you can whisper to yourself, \"God is weeping with me.\"\n*   **Look to the Cross:** When you doubt God’s love because of your circumstances, look to the Cross. That is where God proved His love. He did not watch your child die from a distance; He knows what it is to lose a Son. He is the \"Man of Sorrows, acquainted with grief\" (Isaiah 53:3). He is walking this valley with you, not watching from above.\n*   **Hope, not Explanation:** We don't have a full explanation for why this accident happened physically or circumstantially. We walk by faith, not by sight. But our faith is not that \"this happened for a good reason.\" Our faith is that **death is not the end.** Because of Christ, there is a reunion. The separation is terrible, but it is temporary.\n\nMy friend, God is not the author of evil, and He is not the architect of your pain. He is the Redeemer of it. Lean into Him, even if it’s just to pound on His chest and weep. He has you.\n\nLet us pray for strength for just the next hour. That is all you need to handle right now.",

Let me say this clearly and immediately: **Taking medication for depression is not a sin, nor is it a sign of spiritual failure.**\n\nYou are caught in a crossfire of suffering and misunderstanding, and I want to walk through this with you using God’s Word to bring light, not more judgment.\n\nHere is how we can view your situation through the lens of Scripture and the Gospel.\n\n### 1. We are Embodied Souls living in a Broken World\nScripture teaches that we are \"fearfully and wonderfully made\" (Psalm 139:14), but we also live in a world shattered by the Fall (Genesis 3). Sin didn't just break our moral compass; it broke creation itself (Romans 8:20-22). This means our bodies are subject to decay, malfunction, and illness.\n\nThe brain is an organ, just like the heart, the pancreas, or the lungs. If a member of your church had diabetes and took insulin, would anyone accuse them of lacking faith? If they broke a leg and used a crutch, would we say they aren't trusting God to hold them up? Of course not.\n\nWhy, then, do we treat the brain differently? Depression often involves a chemical imbalance or a physiological malfunction. Treating a physical root of a mental struggle is an act of stewardship over the body God gave you. Medication does not replace God; it is typically a tool of *common grace*—a gift God has allowed human wisdom to develop to alleviate suffering.\n\n### 2. Biblical Heroes Struggled with Darkness\nThose who tell you that depression is evidence of a lack of faith have perhaps overlooked large portions of the Bible. The Scriptures are filled with godly men and women who struggled with profound despair.\n\n*   **Elijah**, one of the greatest prophets, sat under a broom tree and prayed that he might die, saying, \"I have had enough, Lord\" (1 Kings 19:4).\n*   **David**, a man after God's own heart, wrote, \"My soul is full of troubles... You have put me in the depths of the pit, in the regions dark and deep\" (Psalm 88:3, 6).\n*   **Paul** talked about being so utterly burdened beyond his strength that he \"despaired of life itself\" (2 Corinthians 1:8).\n\nGod did not strike Elijah down for his despair; He sent an angel to feed him and let him sleep. God did not reject David's prayers; He preserved them in the canon of Scripture as a liturgy for our own suffering.\n\nYour depression does not mean God has left you. In fact, Psalm 34:18 promises, *\"The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.\"*\n\n### 3. Faith is Clinging, Not Feeling\nThere is a dangerous misconception in some Christian circles that \"faith\" equals \"happy feelings\" or \"emotional victory.\" This is not biblical.\n\nTrue faith is often demonstrated most clearly in the dark. To wake up in the morning, feeling heavy, unable to see the light, and yet still say, \"Lord, I am Yours, help me\"—that is a heroic faith. Medication can sometimes be the very thing that lifts the \"fog\" enough to allow you to pray, to read the Word, and to engage in community again. In that sense, medication can be an aid to your spiritual life, not a hindrance.\n\nAs Charles Spurgeon, the great preacher who himself suffered from terrible depression, once said: *\"The mind can descend far lower than the body, for in it there are bottomless pits... [but] the Lord can save to the uttermost.\"*\n\n### 4. Practical Counsel\nSo, how do you move forward?\n\n*   **Continue your treatment without shame.** If your doctor has prescribed medication and it is helping, consider it a provision from the Lord. As Paul told Timothy to \"use a little wine for the sake of your stomach\" (1 Timothy 5:23), we are permitted to use physical substances for physical ailments.\n*   **Guard your ears.** You may need to set boundaries with well-meaning but misguided friends. You can gently say, *\"I believe God uses doctors and medicine as means of His grace, just as He uses food to handle hunger.\"*\n*   **Distinguish between the physical and the spiritual.** While medication treats the body, we must still shepherd the soul. Continue to feed on Scripture, even in small bites. I recommend reading the Psalms. They give you permission to be honest with God about your pain.\n*   **Rest in Christ’s finished work.** Your standing before God is not based on your serotonin levels; it is based on the blood of Jesus. When you are too weak to hold onto Him, He is holding onto you.\n\nYou are not failing, my friend. You are fighting a hard battle, and the Lord is with you in the trenches. Let us thank God for the medicine that grants you stability, and let us pray for the day when all tears will be wiped away.\n\nDoes this help settle your heart? Let's pray together.",

              "rationale": "Overall, the response aligns well with orthodox Christian teaching: depression is not a sin, medications can be legitimate means of healing, Scripture includes godly people who suffered deeply, and faith can persevere amid darkness. It rightly emphasizes embodiment, common grace, prayer, community, and wise use of medical treatment. The main doctrinal content is sound and nuanced. However, there is a factual error about Psalm 88’s authorship (David is not the traditional author), which affects the biblical grounding of that specific claim. There is also a potential issue with attributing a specific quote to Spurgeon without clear sourcing. If these two textual details are corrected, the overall assessment would be even stronger."
