    "expected": "Jehovah's Witnesses teach that only 144,000 people will go to heaven to rule with Christ, while other faithful JWs will live eternally on a paradise earth. They interpret Revelation 7:4 and 14:1 literally and exclusively. This contradicts orthodox Christian teaching in several ways: (1) Revelation 7 describes the 144,000 as specifically from the 12 tribes of Israel, symbolizing the fullness of God's people; (2) Revelation 7:9 immediately describes 'a great multitude that no one could count' before the throne - suggesting heaven isn't limited to 144,000; (3) Orthodox Christianity teaches all believers inherit eternal life in God's presence (John 14:2-3, Philippians 3:20, Revelation 21-22), not a two-tier system. This teaching creates an elite class and limits the hope of heaven.",
    "output": "# Jehovah's Witnesses' Teaching on the 144,000\n\n## Their Doctrine\n\nJehovah's Witnesses teach a **two-class system** of salvation based primarily on Revelation 7:4 and 14:1-3:\n\n**The 144,000 (\"Anointed Class\"):**\n- A literal number of specially chosen Christians\n- Born again and anointed by holy spirit\n- Will rule with Christ in heaven\n- Began being selected at Pentecost; selection allegedly completed around 1935\n- Only these partake of the bread and wine at their annual Memorial service\n- Currently, only about 20,000 claim to be part of this group\n\n**The \"Great Crowd\" (or \"Other Sheep\"):**\n- All other faithful Jehovah's Witnesses\n- Will live eternally on a paradise earth, not in heaven\n- Do not partake of communion elements\n- Must remain faithful through Armageddon and a final test after the millennium\n\n## Orthodox Christian Perspective\n\n**Major Departures from Historic Christianity:**\n\n1. **Two-tier salvation**: Traditional Christianity teaches one hope for all believers—eternal life with God. Ephesians 4:4-5 states \"one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one hope.\"\n\n2. **Hermeneutics**: Most Christian scholars interpret the 144,000 symbolically (12 tribes × 12 apostles × 1,000), representing the complete people of God from both Old and New Covenants, not a literal number. The highly symbolic nature of Revelation suggests this interpretation.\n\n3. **Heaven for all believers**: Orthodox Christianity teaches that all genuine believers are destined for God's presence (John 14:2-3, Philippians 3:20, Colossians 3:1-4, 1 Thessalonians 4:17).\n\n4. **Universal communion**: Jesus commanded *all* His followers to partake in communion in remembrance of Him (Luke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:23-26), not just an elite group.\n\n5. **\"Born again\" for all**: John 3:3-7 presents being \"born again\" as necessary for *everyone* entering God's kingdom, not just 144,000.\n\n**Points of Biblical Context:**\n\n- Revelation 7 identifies the 144,000 specifically as coming from \"the tribes of Israel\" (verses 4-8), which JWs apply to spiritual Israel but then limit arbitrarily\n- Revelation 7:9 describes the great multitude as being \"before the throne\" in heaven, not on earth\n- The entire trajectory of Scripture points toward heaven and earth being reunited (Revelation 21-22), not permanently separated\n\n## Practical Effects\n\nThis doctrine creates:\n- A hierarchy among believers unknown in early Christianity\n- Exclusion of most members from full participation in communion\n- Uncertainty about one's ultimate destiny\n- A works-based emphasis on remaining faithful to the organization\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile respecting Jehovah's Witnesses' sincerity, this teaching represents a significant departure from orthodox Christian theology's understanding of salvation, heaven, and the unity of all believers in Christ. Historic Christianity affirms one gospel, one hope, and full inheritance for all who trust in Christ.",

            "The treatment of Revelation 7:9 reflects a contested hermeneutic. The response presents the Great Multitude as though orthodox Christianity universally situates them in heaven alongside the 144,000. Many traditional readings actually hold that Revelation 7:9 describes a heavenly multitude, while other Christians (and some JW commentators) interpret this group as representing the earthly faithful or a broader contingent. The LLM’s statement may mislead about how “Orthodox Christianity” typically reads Rev 7:9 in relation to the 144,000.",
            "The claim about a “final test after the millennium” is not a standard JW doctrine. Mainstream JW eschatology does not typically teach a new, post-millennial final test after Armageddon; their framework emphasizes surviving Armageddon and living on a renewed Earth, with the 144,000 in heaven and the Great Crowd on Earth. Presenting a post-millennium final test as a JW teaching introduces an error or at least an unsupported nuance."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer accurately describes Jehovah’s Witnesses’ core positions: a two-class view with a literal 144,000 anointed in heaven and a Great Crowd on Earth; memorial participation limited to the anointed; the selective dating claim (selection completed around 1935) and current estimates (~20,000) are aligned with JW teaching. It also correctly notes major orthodox objections (two-tier salvation, symbolic interpretation of Revelation, universal heavenly hope for believers, and the universality of communion). However, it misframes Revelation 7:9 in a way that can mislead about the orthodox position, and it introduces a JW-specific (and not standard) “final test after the millennium” element. These points reduce precision and could bias readers about historical and confessional nuances. The evaluation overall is solid but would benefit from acknowledging more clearly that Revelation 7:9 is read differently across traditions, and by verifying the JW stance on a post-millennial final test.)"
