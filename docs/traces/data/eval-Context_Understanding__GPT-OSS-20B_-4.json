          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns with the biblical text: Matthew 5:1-2 describes Jesus seeing the crowds and his disciples coming to him, with the Sermon delivered in Galilee. The audience is accurately described as primarily the disciples, with the surrounding crowd listening, which matches the dual audience noted in scripture. The mention of “Jewish listeners in Galilee” is historically appropriate given the context. The response captures the main nuance that the Sermon was addressed to Jesus’ followers but was heard by a larger audience, without asserting the Sermon was exclusively for one group. Overall, faithful to biblical teaching and orthodox understanding."
