    "output": "**Short answer:**  \nThe Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5‑7) was delivered by Jesus to the assembled disciples and the large crowd of Jewish listeners who were gathered in Galilee after his proclamation of the coming kingdom. The words were intended primarily for an early Christ‑centered Jewish congregation and later were written by the gospel’s author for the wider early church in Asia Minor.\n\n---\n\n### 1. What the passage itself tells us\n\n| Textual clue | Interpretation |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| **“And seeing the crowds…”** (Matt 5:1) | The sermon was preached before a visibly large public, a common setting for Jesus’ teachings. |\n| **“Gathered around him”** (Matt 5:2) | Indicates that the listeners were close to Jesus—typical of discipleship and early followers. |\n| **Addresses the “you” of the crowd** (e.g., “you that are rich”) | Direct second‑person address, as in a homily to a congregation. |\n| **Frequent references to “the law,” “lawgiver,” “lawful”** | Uses terminology familiar to a Jewish audience that understood the Torah, Hellenistic jurists, and rabbinic discourse. |\n| **“You Yisrael” / “the law”** (Matt 5:17‑20) | Explicitly frames the teaching inside the context of Israel and its covenantal expectations. |\n\nThese dynamics together point to a primary audience of **Jesus’ Jewish disciples and the nearby believers in Galilee**.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. The broader community context\n\n- **Jewish–Christian milieu of Matthew** – Matthew’s gospel is written for an audience that is *primarily Jewish* (most scholars affirm the “traditional view”). The use of Hebrew idioms, references to the prophets, and the presentation of Jesus as the fulfillment of the law all signal a community that sees itself as an Israelite continuation of the Old Testament narrative.\n\n- **Later missionary community** – The final wording of the sermon, as seen in Matthew’s Greek, is tailored for the *later early church* in the Roman provinces (especially in Asia Minor). This does not change the original audience but reflects the *intended readership* of the gospel. Thus, while the preaching was addressed to a Galilean crowd, Matthew wrote the passage for a more diverse Christian audience, which may have included Gentiles.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Scholarly perspectives\n\n| Scholar/View | Position |\n|--------------|----------|\n| **Traditional majority** | The sermon was delivered to the assembled disciples and the crowd of Jews in Galilee. The text itself is a direct narrative of that event. |\n| **Universalist or “multi‑cultural” view** | Some commentators note that the teachings (e.g., “Blessed are the merciful”) have universal applicability, and they argue the sermon had a non‑Jewish component implicitly addressed to Greek‑speaking listeners. This view is supported by the presence of Greek idioms and the anti‑elitist tone appealing beyond the synagogal setting. |\n| **Reconstructionist** | A small minority suggest Jesus’ sermon was mainly privately addressed to a small group (the Twelve or a select group of disciples) with the public hearing a condensed version. This view is less widely accepted. |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Bottom line\n\n- **Immediate, primary audience:**  \n  *Disciples and the gathered crowd of Jews in Galilee, who were following Jesus and had gathered after hearing about the kingdom of heaven.*\n\n- **Secondary, eventual audience (through Matthew’s writing):**  \n  *The early Christian community (predominantly Jewish‑Christians, but later expanded to Gentile converts) in Asia Minor and elsewhere within the Roman Empire.*\n\nThus the Sermon on the Mount can be seen as **first** a practical sermon for Jesus’ immediate Jewish listeners, and **second** a crafted teaching aimed at a later, broader Christian audience, but *the core of its address lies in a Galilean Jewish context.*",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the immediate, primary audience as Jesus’ disciples and the surrounding crowds in Galilee, which aligns with the text of Matthew 5:1 and the traditional reading. It supports this with textual cues (crowds, gathering, addressing ‘you’), and situates the sermon within a Jewish-Galilean context (references to the law and Israel). It also adds a layered, scholarly-informed view by noting Matthew’s likely Jewish-Christian readership and the broader early church in Asia Minor as the eventual audience for the gospel’s readership, which is a standard scholarly hypothesis rather than a universal claim. The response explicitly acknowledges other scholarly perspectives (universalist/multi-cultural, reconstructionist) and uses cautious language where debates exist, reflecting appropriate nuance. In terms of relevance, the answer directly responds to the question about the primary audience and then provides well-supported context. The only potential quibble is the framing of the immediate audience as “Jewish listeners” (the crowd would have included non-Jews in some contexts), but this is not a substantive error given the Galilean Jewish milieu and the dominant scholarly emphasis on a Jewish-Christian audience in Matthew. Overall, the answer is accurate, complete, and nuanced."
