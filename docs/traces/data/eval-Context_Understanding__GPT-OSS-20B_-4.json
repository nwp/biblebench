When he saw the crowds, he sat down… The disciples were also with him.” | The text explicitly identifies the disciples as the people “with” Jesus, indicating that they were the main recipients of His teaching. |\n| **Matthew 5:16‑21** | “Let your light shine before men” – directed at the disciples’ future work. | The sermon is framed as training for the disciples’ mission, not merely a sermon for passive listeners. |\n| **Historical Setting** | 1st‑century Galilee. Jesus holds a “mountain meeting” where he speaks to the assembled crowd. | In the cultural context, “meeting on a mountain” was a familiar format for teaching by a recognized teacher; the crowd was present but the lesson was chiefly for the small group of close followers. |\n| **Early Church Tradition** | Luke’s Gospel records that Jesus taught “on a mountain” to “the crowd.” | Both Gospels situate the event among the disciples and a larger group, implying that the disciples were the intended hearers, with the crowd as witnesses. |\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Disciples as the Core Audience**  \n   * Matthew opens the Sermon on the Mount with the disciples seated beside Jesus (cf. Mark 9:2‑5; Luke 9:5‑6).  \n   * The teaching frequently treats the disciples as part of an “inner circle” (e.g., Matthew 5:14–20, “You are the salt of the earth,” etc.).  \n\n2. **The Larger Crowd as Witnesses / Secondary Audience**  \n   * The crowd is “present” but is not addressed directly for instruction; they are there to observe the disciples receiving the teaching.  \n   * Occasionally, the sermon’s “law-like” structure (e.g., “You have heard… but I say…” in Matthew 5:21‑48) is meant to demonstrate how the disciples should repurpose the Law for a broader public.  \n\n3. **Purpose of the Sermon for the Disciples**  \n   * The sermon equips the disciples for their missionary task—governed by “Holiness” and “Mission” (cf. Matthew 5:13‑16, “You are the salt of the earth, you are the light of the world”).  \n   * It sets theological, ethical, and doctrinal foundations that the disciples would later transmit to future Christian communities.  \n\n4. **Scholarly Consensus**  \n   * The **traditional or majority view** holds that the Sermon on the Mount was delivered to Jesus’ disciples (the people “with” Him) with the large crowd as a listening audience.  \n   * Some scholars emphasize that the teaching was later redacted by the author of Matthew as a didactic tool for the first Christian community.  However, regardless of redaction, the **primary hearers in the original oral context** were the fellow followers—especially the twelve.  \n\n### Bottom Line\n\nThe *primary audience* of the Sermon on the Mount was **Jesus’ disciples**—the fist‑hand, close‑followers who were to embody and spread the message. The many people who gathered on the mountain were **secondary listeners** primarily witnessing the disciples’ instruction. This distinction underlies why the sermon takes the shape of a “masterclass” for the disciples, preparing them for the work that would shape early Christianity.",

            "The response incorrectly cites Luke as teaching 'on a mountain' in the Sermon on the Mount. Luke 6:17–19 describes Jesus teaching in a level place, not on a mountain (the Beatitudes in Luke are often called the Sermon on the Plain). This is a factual error in the source material.",
            "Some phrasing implies Luke explicitly supports the mountain setting, which misrepresents Luke’s narrative localization of the sermon. While Luke does place the event among the crowd and the disciples, the mountain metaphor is Matthew-specific."
          ],
          "rationale": "The core claim—that the primary audience for the Sermon on the Mount is Jesus’ disciples (with the crowd as a secondary audience) aligns with Matthew 5:1–2 and the broader scholarly consensus. The answer appropriately cites Matthew 5:1–2 and discusses how the sermon functions for the disciples, and it acknowledges scholarly nuance about redaction and audience. However, it contains a factual error by attributing Luke’s account to a mountain setting (Luke records a level place). This error affects the factual integrity of the answer, though the overall analysis remains largely reasonable and nuanced."
