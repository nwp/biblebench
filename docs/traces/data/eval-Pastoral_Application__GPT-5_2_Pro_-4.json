    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "No—you are not automatically failing spiritually because you take medication for depression. Depression is a form of suffering, and suffering is not a reliable measure of your faith. Some of God’s most faithful servants knew deep darkness of soul.\n\n### 1) Scripture makes room for believers who feel crushed\nThe Bible doesn’t pretend God’s people always feel “fine.”\n\n- **David**: “Why are you cast down, O my soul…?” (Psalm 42:5).  \n- **A psalm with no happy ending**: Psalm 88 is a believer’s prayer from the pit. God put that in Scripture to teach us that darkness is not the same as godlessness.  \n- **Elijah**, after a great victory, fell into despair and wanted to die (1 Kings 19:4). God’s first care for him was *rest, food, and gentle presence*—not shame.\n\nFeeling depressed is not the same thing as choosing unbelief. Often it’s a burden you’re carrying—emotionally, physically, and spiritually.\n\n### 2) Using medicine can be an act of faith, not a lack of faith\nGod often helps us through “ordinary means”—the care of others, wise counsel, and medicine. Scripture is not anti-medicine.\n\n- **Luke** was a physician (Colossians 4:14).  \n- Paul told Timothy to use a medicinal remedy for his stomach (1 Timothy 5:23).  \n- The Good Samaritan treated wounds with practical care (Luke 10:34).\n\nTaking medication can be like using insulin for diabetes or an inhaler for asthma. It doesn’t replace prayer; it can support you so you’re better able to pray, work, relate, and receive help.\n\nTrusting God does not mean refusing the tools he provides. It means looking to him as your ultimate hope while you use wise help along the way.\n\n### 3) “More faith” is not a simple fix—and guilt is not a cure\nSometimes well-meaning Christians say things that are too simplistic. While it’s true that our spiritual life affects our emotional life, it’s not true that every case of depression is caused by weak faith or hidden sin. The body and soul are intertwined. Sleep deprivation, trauma, hormones, chronic stress, grief, isolation, and genetics can all play a role.\n\nAlso, condemnation is never the voice of Christ toward his struggling people: “There is therefore now **no condemnation** for those who are in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1). Jesus does not break bruised reeds (Isaiah 42:3; Matthew 12:20).\n\n### 4) What you can do—practically and spiritually\nHere are wise next steps that honor both your faith and your health:\n\n1. **Continue working with your doctor/psychiatrist**  \n   Medication isn’t one-size-fits-all. If side effects, numbness, or lack of improvement are issues, ask about dosage changes, different meds, or a careful plan—never stop abruptly without medical guidance.\n\n2. **Consider therapy alongside medication**  \n   Many people benefit from counseling (often CBT, trauma-informed therapy, or grief work). This is not unspiritual; it’s a form of help and wisdom (Proverbs 11:14).\n\n3. **Invite the church in—safely**  \n   Ask a trusted pastor/elder or mature believer to walk with you, pray with you, and check in. “Bear one another’s burdens” (Galatians 6:2). You should not have to carry this alone.\n\n4. **Build small, sustainable spiritual rhythms (not crushing expectations)**  \n   In depression, big goals can backfire. Try “low-lift” practices:\n   - One Psalm a day (especially lament psalms like 42, 43, 88)  \n   - Short, honest prayers: “Lord, have mercy,” “Help me endure,” “I believe; help my unbelief” (Mark 9:24)  \n   - Worship music, brief walks, sitting in sunlight, consistent sleep—these are not “unspiritual”; they’re part of caring for a whole person.\n\n5. **Watch for isolating lies**  \n   Depression often says: *You’re a burden. Nothing will change. God is tired of you.* Those are not God’s promises. God is “near to the brokenhearted” (Psalm 34:18). Your feelings are real, but they are not always reliable narrators.\n\n### 5) A gentle diagnostic question (without shame)\nIt can be helpful—not to blame yourself, but to be honest—asking: *Is there any known sin to repent of, any relationship to reconcile, or any habit worsening my darkness?* Sometimes there is. Often there isn’t. Either way, the answer is the same starting point: bring yourself to Christ, who welcomes the weary (Matthew 11:28–30).\n\n### 6) If you are ever in danger\nIf you’re having thoughts of self-harm or feel unsafe, please seek immediate help—call your local emergency number, go to the nearest emergency room, or contact a crisis hotline in your country. Tell someone you trust right away. That step is courage, not failure.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me: What has your depression been like lately (energy, sleep, hopelessness, anxiety), and do you have supportive people around you? I can help you think through a next-step plan that’s both spiritually and practically grounded.",

It acknowledges depression as a real medical condition and emphasizes the integration of faith, therapy, and medical treatment. Nuance is present in recognizing that not all depression stems from sin or weak faith and in distinguishing condemnation from genuine spiritual concern. It also includes practical guidance (therapy, church support, healthy spiritual rhythms, safety planning) and a clear safety note for self-harm. A potential minor caveat is the brief diagnostic prompt about possible sin; while it is hedged with “often there isn’t” and is contextualized, some readers might misinterpret it. Overall, the answer faithfully reflects orthodox Christian teaching on mental health and medicine."

The guidance is robust, actionable, and pastorally sound."
