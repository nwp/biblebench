    "expected": "Original sin is the doctrine that all humanity inherited a sinful nature from Adam's fall. As a result, all people are born with a inclination toward sin and are spiritually separated from God. This doesn't mean infants are guilty of actual sins, but that human nature is corrupted and inclined toward evil apart from God's grace.",
    "output": "**Original sin** is the Christian doctrine that, because of Adam’s first rebellion against God, all human beings are born **(1) guilty/condemned in relation to God** and **(2) inwardly corrupted in their nature**, so that sin and death characterize human life apart from saving grace in Christ.\n\n## 1) Biblical foundation\n\n### A. Humanity’s fall in Adam (Genesis 3)\nGenesis 3 portrays the first human disobedience and its consequences: alienation from God, disorder in human life, and death. This “fall” is not treated as an isolated private act, but as a decisive event affecting the whole human race.\n\n### B. Adam as representative head of humanity (Romans 5:12–19)\nPaul explicitly ties the condition of all humans to Adam:\n\n- “Sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men…” (Rom 5:12)  \n- “By the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners” (Rom 5:19)  \n- “One trespass led to condemnation for all men” (Rom 5:18)\n\nRomans 5 is central because it frames Adam’s act as having corporate consequences, and it parallels Adam with Christ (“the last Adam”): just as Adam’s one act affects many, Christ’s obedience brings justification and life to many (Rom 5:17–19).\n\n### C. Humans are sinful from the beginning (Psalm 51:5)\nDavid laments, “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me” (Ps 51:5). This is commonly understood as indicating that sin is not merely learned behavior; it is present from our origin.\n\n### D. Humans are born spiritually “dead” and inclined to sin (Ephesians 2:1–3)\nPaul says people are “dead in…trespasses and sins” and are “by nature children of wrath” (Eph 2:1–3), pointing to a built-in condition, not only a series of chosen acts.\n\n### E. Death as universal evidence (1 Corinthians 15:21–22)\n“For as by a man came death… For as in Adam all die” (1 Cor 15:21–22). Universal death is treated as the sign that humanity shares in Adam’s fallen condition.\n\n## 2) What original sin includes\n\nChristian theology has typically described original sin under two related aspects:\n\n### A. **Inherited guilt / condemnation**\nBecause Adam functioned as humanity’s representative, his trespass results in condemnation that reaches his descendants (Rom 5:16–18). This is why Scripture can speak of humanity as already “under wrath” (Eph 2:3) prior to personal acts.\n\n### B. **Inherited corruption (a fallen nature)**\nOriginal sin also means that human nature is now disordered: our desires, reasoning, and will are bent away from God. This corruption produces actual sins in thought, word, and deed (Mark 7:21–23; Jas 1:14–15). We sin because we are sinners by nature; we do not become sinners only after we commit individual sins.\n\n## 3) What original sin is not\n\n- **Not merely imitation:** The doctrine is more than “we copy Adam’s bad example.” Romans 5 portrays Adam’s act as causally connected to universal condemnation and death, not simply inspiration for sinful choices.\n- **Not the claim that humans are as evil as possible:** Many traditions distinguish between being thoroughly affected by sin and being maximally wicked. The doctrine says sin reaches every part of the person, not that every person is as bad as they could be.\n- **Not personal guilt for others’ later sins:** Original sin concerns our relation to Adam’s first sin and the corrupted condition inherited from it, alongside our own subsequent actual sins.\n\n## 4) Major Christian emphases (briefly)\n\n- **Reformed/Protestant traditions** often stress both *imputed guilt* (Adam’s guilt counted to his posterity) and *total depravity* (pervasive corruption), grounded especially in Romans 5 and Ephesians 2.\n- **Roman Catholic theology** typically defines original sin as the **privation of original holiness and justice** inherited from Adam, with an inclination to sin (concupiscence). It affirms the universality of the fall while expressing inherited “guilt” in terms of a fallen state needing grace.\n- **Eastern Orthodox theology** often prefers “ancestral sin,” emphasizing the inheritance of **mortality and corruption** and humanity’s enslaved condition, while tending to speak less in terms of inherited legal guilt—yet still affirming that Adam’s fall profoundly affects all.\n\n## 5) Why the doctrine matters: Christ as the remedy\nOriginal sin sets the stage for the gospel. Scripture presents Jesus as the “last Adam” (1 Cor 15:45): where Adam brought sin and death, Christ brings righteousness and life (Rom 5:17–19). The answer to original sin is not self-repair but **grace**, given through Christ—new birth, forgiveness, and renewed nature by the Spirit (John 3:3–6; Eph 2:4–10).\n\nIf you’d like, I can summarize how original sin relates to infant baptism, human freedom, or the difference between “imputed guilt” and “inherited corruption” in various traditions.",

          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately presents original sin as a twofold condition (inherited guilt/condemnation and inherited corruption) rooted in Adam’s fall, with solid biblical anchors (Rom 5, Eph 2, 1 Cor 15) and a clear articulation of how major traditions differ. It also notes the gospel remedy in Christ and provides appropriate nuance about differences among Reformed/Protestant, Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox perspectives. Some wording could risk readers inferring universal personal guilt for infants unless carefully parsed, and Psalm 51:5 as proof of original sin is a debated point; more explicit discussion of the Orthodox emphasis on ancestral sin versus inherited guilt could enhance precision. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."

          "explanation": "The response presents a mainstream, orthodox account of original sin. It cites key biblical passages (Gen 3; Rom 5; Eph 2; 1 Cor 15; Ps 51:5) and distinguishes two interrelated aspects—imputed guilt (condemnation) and inherited corruption (fallen nature). It acknowledges the variance among major traditions: Reformed/Protestant, Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox, and it correctly notes that original sin is not merely imitation, nor a claim that humans are as evil as possible. It aligns with the idea that Christ is the remedy (the last Adam). Minor caveats: some traditions (especially many Eastern Orthodox) prefer “ancestral sin” language and resist describing inherited guilt in strictly legal terms; the text’s use of “imputed guilt” and “under wrath” may require nuance depending on the reader’s tradition. Overall, no heresy is taught; if anything, the piece is methodical and historically informed. If desired, I can add a more explicit, tradition-by-tradition comparison (e.g., Augustine vs. Pelagian critiques, or Catholic/Orthodox nuance) and address infant baptism implications."
