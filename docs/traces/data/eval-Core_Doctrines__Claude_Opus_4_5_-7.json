    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "# The Doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body\n\n## Definition\n\nThe resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that God will raise the physical bodies of all the dead at the end of the age, reuniting body and soul for eternal existence—the righteous to everlasting life and the unrighteous to judgment.\n\n## Biblical Foundation\n\n**Old Testament Anticipations:**\n- Job 19:26—\"And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God\"\n- Daniel 12:2—\"Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt\"\n- Isaiah 26:19—\"Your dead will live; their bodies will rise\"\n\n**New Testament Teaching:**\n- Christ's bodily resurrection as the paradigm and guarantee (1 Corinthians 15:20-23)\n- Jesus's teaching in John 5:28-29 on the resurrection of all\n- Paul's extended treatment in 1 Corinthians 15, describing the \"spiritual body\" (σῶμα πνευματικόν)—not immaterial, but a body animated and transformed by the Spirit\n\n## Key Theological Distinctions\n\n**Continuity and Transformation:** The resurrection body maintains personal identity with the earthly body yet is glorified—imperishable, glorious, powerful (1 Cor. 15:42-44). Christ's risen body bore the wounds yet transcended physical limitations.\n\n**Against Gnosticism:** This doctrine affirms the inherent goodness of material creation. Salvation is not escape *from* the body but redemption *of* the body (Romans 8:23).\n\n## Creedal Affirmation\n\nThe Apostles' Creed confesses: \"I believe in...the resurrection of the body.\" This has been the universal Christian confession across Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant traditions.\n\n## Pastoral Significance\n\nThis doctrine grounds Christian hope not in disembodied existence but in embodied, renewed life within the new creation—where God dwells with His people in resurrected fullness.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response closely mirrors historic Christian teaching on the resurrection of the body: it describes a physical, glorified resurrection at the eschaton, not mere spiritual immortality; it grounds the doctrine in key biblical texts (OT anticipations such as Job 19:26; Daniel 12:2; Isaiah 26:19; NT affirmations in 1 Cor 15, John 5:28-29) and identifies the continuity and transformation of the resurrected body (sōma pneumatikon) while noting that Christ’s risen body bears wounds. It correctly emphasizes the holistic redemption of the person (body and soul), the anti-Gnostic emphasis, and creedal affirmation (resurrection of the body). The pastoral aim—hope in embodied life in the new creation—is appropriately included. Minor caveats include: (1) the text treats the resurrection as a single eschatological event without addressing the sometimes emphasized intermediate state between death and resurrection in various traditions; (2) while generally accurate, the claim of the Apostles’ Creed as universally phrased “the resurrection of the body” can vary slightly in wording across traditions (some use “the resurrection of the dead”). Overall, the core doctrinal content is accurate, well-supported biblically, and properly nuanced."

          "explanation": "The response presents an orthodox, biblical, and creedal understanding of the resurrection of the body. It affirms bodily resurrection, continuity and transformation, the goodness of material creation, and rejects Gnosticism and Docetism. It cites appropriate biblical texts (1 Corinthians 15; John 5; Romans 8:23; Job, Daniel, Isaiah) and notes the Apostles' Creed. No Arian, Modalist, Pelagian, Gnostic, or Docetic claims are made. Minor clarifications could note nuances in Paul’s term σῶμα πνευματικόν (spiritual body) and the exact wording of creedal confessions, but these do not constitute heresy."
