        "output": "That depends on what you mean by “the Bible,” what you mean by “errors,” and what you think the Bible is trying to *affirm* (history? science? theology? moral teaching? all of the above). Different Christian traditions and scholars answer it differently.\n\n## 1) Classic evangelical/protestant “inerrancy” answer: **No (in what it affirms)**\nMany evangelicals hold that Scripture is *inerrant*: everything the biblical authors intend to assert is true, because God is truthful.\n\n- This view often adds important qualifiers:\n  - **Inerrant in the original writings (“autographs”)**, while acknowledging copyist mistakes and translation issues.\n  - **Genre matters**: poetry uses metaphor; parables aren’t history; apocalyptic is symbolic; “phenomenological” language (“sunrise”) isn’t a scientific claim.\n  - **“What it affirms”** is what the author intends to teach, not every possible modern inference.\n\nA standard modern articulation is the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978)**.\n\n## 2) Catholic and some other traditions: **No error in what God intends for our salvation, but not necessarily in every incidental detail**\nThe Catholic Church typically speaks of Scripture as teaching “without error” the truth God wanted put into Scripture **for the sake of salvation**, while also emphasizing interpretation according to genre and authorial intent.\n\n- *Dei Verbum* (Vatican II) says the books of Scripture “teach solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings **for the sake of salvation**.”\n- This is often read as: the Bible is fully reliable in its saving message, but not necessarily meant to function as a modern scientific or technical textbook.\n\n## 3) “Infallibility” (common in many mainline Protestant approaches): **The Bible is trustworthy in its purpose, but may contain factual/chronological tensions**\nMany Christians hold Scripture is *infallible* in accomplishing God’s purpose (revealing God, forming faith, teaching salvation), while allowing that it may include:\n- differences in reported numbers, chronology, or phrasing across parallel accounts,\n- historical or scientific descriptions shaped by ancient perspectives,\n- editorial seams from compilation and transmission.\n\nOn this view, those are not “failures” of Scripture’s spiritual authority, but features of how God used human authors in real historical contexts.\n\n## 4) Critical/academic approach (common in secular scholarship and some Christian scholarship): **Yes, there are errors and contradictions by modern factual standards**\nMany critical scholars treat the Bible as a library of ancient texts with diverse sources and aims. They often argue it contains:\n- genuine historical disagreements between sources,\n- legendary development in certain narratives,\n- theological diversity that sometimes produces tension between texts.\n\nFrom this perspective, the Bible can still be profoundly valuable, but not uniformly “error-free” as a factual record.\n\n## 5) A key complication: textual transmission\nEven people who affirm inerrancy typically acknowledge:\n- **textual variants** exist across manuscripts (most are minor; a few are significant),\n- therefore, “the Bible” as you encounter it in translations is mediated by textual criticism and translation decisions.\n\nThis doesn’t automatically mean the Bible “errs,” but it matters for how the question is framed.\n\n---\n\n### A clarifying question (because it changes the answer)\nWhen you say “errors in what it affirms,” do you mean:\n1) theological/moral teaching,  \n2) historical claims,  \n3) scientific descriptions, or  \n4) any kind of discrepancy between passages?\n\nIf you tell me which of those you mean (and what tradition/context you’re coming from), I can give a more precise answer with concrete examples and how each view addresses them.",
