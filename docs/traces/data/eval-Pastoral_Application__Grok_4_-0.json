    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "My dear friend, first and foremost, let me say how deeply I appreciate you coming to me with this burden on your heart. As a parent myself, I can only imagine the weight of devastation and fear you're carrying right now—it's a profound pain to see someone we love, especially our child, wrestling with doubts about the very foundation of our faith. You're not alone in this; many godly parents have walked this path, from the biblical figures like Abraham and Sarah, who navigated their own uncertainties, to countless families in our church community. Let's turn to God's Word together for guidance, and I'll offer some practical steps rooted in Scripture to help you respond with wisdom and love.\n\n### Start with Compassion and Listening\nRemember, your daughter is a precious gift from God (Psalm 127:3), and her questions don't diminish her value or your role as her parent. It's normal for teenagers to explore their beliefs—faith isn't inherited like eye color; it must become personal. The Bible shows us that even great heroes of faith, like Thomas (John 20:24-29), had moments of doubt, and Jesus met him with grace, not condemnation. Jesus didn't scold Thomas; He invited him to see and believe.\n\nSo, begin by listening without judgment. Create a safe space for her to share her thoughts openly. James 1:19 urges us, \"Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.\" Ask gentle questions like, \"What parts of faith are you struggling with?\" or \"What experiences have led you to these questions?\" Avoid debates or lectures that might push her away—Ephesians 6:4 reminds fathers (and parents) not to exasperate their children, but to bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. Your goal isn't to \"fix\" her doubt immediately but to show her the love of Christ through your patience.\n\n### Model Authentic Faith and Pray Fervently\nAs you process your own grief, lean into the Lord. It's okay to feel scared—pour that out to Him, as David did in the Psalms (e.g., Psalm 42:11: \"Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God\"). But don't let fear drive your actions. Instead, model a living faith. Deuteronomy 6:6-7 instructs us to impress God's commandments on our children by talking about them when we sit at home, walk along the road, lie down, and get up. Live out your belief in everyday ways—through kindness, forgiveness, and joy—even amid your pain. Let her see that faith sustains you, not just as a set of rules, but as a relationship with a loving God.\n\nAbove all, pray. Commit this to God in persistent prayer, as Jesus taught in Luke 18:1-8 with the parable of the persistent widow. Pray for her heart to be softened, for wisdom in your words, and for the Holy Spirit to draw her back (John 6:44). Involve your spouse or trusted friends in prayer, and consider fasting if the Lord leads. Remember, salvation is God's work, not ours (Ephesians 2:8-9); we plant seeds, but He gives the growth (1 Corinthians 3:6-7).\n\n### Seek Wise Counsel and Community Support\nProverbs 22:6 promises, \"Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.\" This doesn't mean faith journeys are always linear—think of the prodigal son in Luke 15:11-32, who wandered far but returned to a father's open arms. If your daughter is open, gently encourage her to talk with a youth pastor, mentor, or counselor who can address her questions thoughtfully. Resources like C.S. Lewis's *Mere Christianity* or Lee Strobel's *The Case for Christ* might help if she's intellectually curious, but only suggest them without pressure.\n\nDon't isolate yourself—share this with a small group or trusted elders in the church for support and accountability (Galatians 6:2: \"Carry each other's burdens\"). If there are underlying issues like trauma, peer pressure, or mental health struggles contributing to her doubts, professional Christian counseling could be invaluable. And if she's willing, invite her to church events or service opportunities where she can experience God's love in action, not just theory.\n\n### Hold onto Hope in God's Faithfulness\nFinally, my friend, take heart: God is sovereign and pursues the lost sheep with relentless love (Luke 15:3-7). Your daughter's questions don't mean she's lost forever; they could be the beginning of a deeper, more authentic faith. Trust in His timing and goodness, even when it's hard. As 2 Peter 3:9 assures us, the Lord is patient, \"not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.\"\n\nLet's pray together right now: *Heavenly Father, we lift this precious daughter to You. Soften her heart, reveal Your truth, and surround her with Your peace. Give this parent wisdom, strength, and unwavering love. May Your grace prevail in this family. In Jesus' name, Amen.*\n\nI'm here for you—let's talk more if you'd like, or I can connect you with others who've been through similar seasons. God bless you as you navigate this with faith and love.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns with orthodox Christian teaching on doubt as part of faith development, emphasizes compassionate pastoral care, and grounds its guidance in Scripture. It correctly references and applies key biblical passages (James 1:19; Ephesians 6:4; Psalm 42:11; John 20:29; Deuteronomy 6:6-7; Luke 18:1-8; Ephesians 2:8-9; 1 Corinthians 3:6-7; Luke 15:11-32; Galatians 6:2; John 6:44; 2 Peter 3:9) to encourage listening, modeling authentic faith, praying, seeking wise counsel, and understanding God’s sovereignty in salvation. It also acknowledges the possibility of underlying issues (trauma, mental health) and recommends professional counseling when appropriate, which is prudent and pastorally responsible. The response emphasizes parental love, creates a safe space for questions, and avoids coercive tactics, while pointing toward resources and ongoing community support. Minor caveats exist only in how Proverbs 22:6 is framed as a guarantee (the passage is best understood as a principle about faith formation rather than an absolute promise), but the reply itself already notes that faith journeys are not strictly linear and includes balanced nuance. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."

It is pastorally sensitive, offering compassion, safe space for questions, modeling authentic faith, and involving community and professional resources when needed. It provides practical wisdom through actionable steps: listening-first, avoiding judgment, praying, seeking mentors, and inviting constructive resources, while encouraging ongoing dialogue and patience. It remains biblically grounded by repeatedly citing and aligning with Scripture and Christian practice. The balance between truth and grace is well-maintained: it upholds doctrinal convictions while prioritizing love, empathy, and the daughter’s well-being. Some refinements could include a more explicit, time-bound action plan and heightened attention to honoring the daughter’s autonomy and pace in her faith journey."
