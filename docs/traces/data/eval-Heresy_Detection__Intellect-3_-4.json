    "input": "Someone teaches: 'The God of the Old Testament is different from the God of the New Testament. The Old Testament God was wrathful and evil, while Jesus revealed the true, good God.' What's wrong with this view?",
    "expected": "This resembles Marcionism, a second-century heresy that rejected the Old Testament and taught there were two different gods. This is false. Orthodox Christianity affirms the unity of God across both Testaments. The same God who created the world, gave the law, and showed justice in the Old Testament is the God who sent Jesus. Jesus himself affirmed the Old Testament (Matthew 5:17-18) and revealed God's character as both just and merciful throughout scripture.",
    "output": "This teaching represents a **serious heresy**, specifically a modern form of **Marcionism**, condemned throughout church history. Here's a breakdown of why it's wrong and inconsistent with orthodox Christian doctrine:\n\n1.  **Violation of Divine Unity and Immutability:**\n    *   Orthodox Christianity affirms the absolute unity of God (Deuteronomy 6:4). There is only one God (Isaiah 45:5-6, 18, 22; 1 Corinthians 8:4-6; Mark 12:29-30).\n    *   God is also immutable in His essential nature and attributes (Malachi 3:6; James 1:17; Psalm 102:26-27). While He relates to humanity in different ways (e.g., as Creator, Redeemer, Judge), His fundamental character remains consistent.\n    *   The statement posits *two* different divine beings: an \"evil\" Old Testament God and a \"good\" New Testament God (revealed by Jesus). This directly contradicts the doctrine of the one, unchanging God.\n\n2.  **Misrepresentation of the Old Testament God:**\n    *   **Wrath is not the only attribute:** While God's righteous wrath against sin is clearly present in the Old Testament (e.g., the Flood, Sodom and Gomorrah, the Exile), it is *always* presented alongside His attributes of **love, mercy, grace, patience, faithfulness, and longsuffering**. Key passages reveal God's self-description:\n        *   Exodus 34:6-7: \"The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, and forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty...\"\n        *   Psalm 103:8-10: \"The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. He will not always chide, nor will he keep his anger forever. He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities.\"\n        *   Lamentations 3:22-23: \"The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases, his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.\"\n    *   **God's actions are consistently relational:** God's judgments are often framed within His covenant relationship with Israel, aimed at discipline, correction, and ultimately restoration. His deliverance (Exodus), provision (Manna), and promises (Davidic Covenant) are acts of profound grace and love.\n    *   **The God of the Psalms:** The Psalms overwhelmingly praise God's love, mercy, faithfulness, and goodness (e.g., Psalms 100, 136).\n\n3.  **Misrepresentation of the New Testament God:**\n    *   **God's wrath is not absent:** The New Testament explicitly teaches that God's wrath *remains* against sin and unrighteousness (John 3:36; Romans 1:18-32; 2:5, 8; Ephesians 5:6; Colossians 3:6; Revelation 6:16-17, 19:15). Jesus himself spoke more about judgment and hell than anyone else in the New Testament (e.g., Matthew 10:28, 13:40-42, 25:41-46).\n    *   **Jesus reveals the *same* God:** Jesus explicitly identified himself with the God of the Old Testament (e.g., \"Before Abraham was, I AM\" - John 8:58, echoing Exodus 3:14; \"I and the Father are one\" - John 10:30). He taught his disciples to pray to \"Our Father,\" the God revealed in the Old Testament. He constantly referenced Old Testament scriptures as authoritative and fulfilled them.\n\n4.  **Contradiction of Jesus' Own Teachings and Actions:**\n    *   Jesus upheld the authority and divine origin of the entire Old Testament (Matthew 5:17-18, Luke 16:17, John 10:35).\n    *   He constantly referenced Old Testament figures and events, presenting them as part of God's unified redemptive plan (e.g., his teachings on the Law and the Prophets, his references to Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Elijah, etc.).\n    *   Jesus' actions, like driving out money changers (echoing Old Testament zeal for God's holiness - John 2:13-17), demonstrate his identification with the God of justice as well as love.\n\n5.  **Undermining the Coherence of Scripture and Salvation History:**\n    *   The Bible presents itself as a unified revelation from the one true God. The New Testament authors constantly interpret Old Testament events, prophecies, and laws as pointing forward to Christ and the New Covenant (e.g., Hebrews, Romans 3:21-26, 1 Peter 1:10-12).\n    *   The New Covenant promised in Jeremiah 31:31-34 is presented as a *fulfillment* and *internal transformation* of the relationship with the *same* God, not a rejection of Him and an introduction of a new one.\n\n**Why is this Heresy Dangerous?**\n\n*   **Creates a False Dichotomy:** It splits God's character, making Him seem schizophrenic and undermining His sovereignty and consistency.\n*   **Misreads Scripture:** It ignores the full revelation of God's character in *both* testaments.\n*   **Denies the Unity of God's Plan:** It severs the connection between God's actions in the Old Testament and His ultimate revelation in Christ, making the Old Testament irrelevant or even misleading.\n*   **Undermines the Authority of Christ:** Jesus himself affirmed the Old Testament and identified with the God it reveals. Rejecting the Old Testament God is ultimately rejecting the God Jesus worshipped and revealed.\n*   **Promotes Anti-Semitism:** Historically, this view has fueled contempt for Judaism and the Old Testament as inferior or evil, which is contrary to the Apostle Paul's teaching (Romans 9-11).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe teaching that the God of the Old Testament is fundamentally different and inferior to the God revealed by Jesus is **heretical** because it violates the core doctrines of the unity and immutability of God, misrepresents the character of God revealed in both testaments, contradicts the teachings and actions of Jesus himself, and severs the organic unity of God's revelation and salvation history. Orthodox Christianity affirms that the God who revealed Himself in creation, the Old Testament covenants, the Law, the Prophets, and ultimately in Jesus Christ is the *same* God – perfectly consistent in His holiness, justice, love, mercy, and grace. The New Testament reveals the *fullness* and *interiority* of that same God through Christ, not a *different* God.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately identifies the teaching as a form of Marcionism and treats it as a serious doctrinal error. It upholds the orthodox doctrine of the unity and immutability of God across the Old and New Testaments, while acknowledging that wrath is a biblically attested attribute of God in both Testaments and that God’s judgments are related to covenant faithfulness. It correctly argues that the New Testament does not negate the Old Testament God; Jesus affirms and fulfills the OT, and NT writings interpret OT revelation in light of Christ, preserving a coherent salvation history. The response cites key scriptures (e.g., Exodus 34:6-7; Romans 1:18-32; John 8:58; Matthew 5:17-18; Hebrews 9-10 arguments) to ground its claims. It also notes the historical danger of anti-Semitism attached to the view and the risk of undermining Scripture’s unity. Nuance-wise, it recognizes the complexity of divine revelation being unified across covenants rather than a simple dichotomy, and it emphasizes that God’s actions in the OT (judgment, justice) are relational within His covenant, while still remaining the same God who is loving and merciful. A potential minor nuance not fully explored is the full biblical discussion of immutability versus apparent divine relenting in specific passages (e.g., Exodus 32:14, 1 Samuel 15:11), though the answer uses a standard reformational understanding that God’s essential nature does not change even as He relates differently in various covenants. Overall, the answer is theologcally accurate, doctrinally sound, well-grounded in Scripture, and nuanced in its treatment of the issue."
