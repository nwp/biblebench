    "expected": "Christians hold various eschatological views: Premillennialism believes Christ returns before a literal thousand-year reign. Postmillennialism expects Christ returns after the church establishes God's kingdom on earth. Amillennialism sees the millennium as symbolic of the current church age. Within premillennialism, pretribulationists believe the rapture precedes tribulation, while post-tribulationists place it after. Preterists see many prophecies as fulfilled in 70 AD. Despite these differences, all orthodox Christians affirm Christ's personal return, final judgment, bodily resurrection, and eternal states of heaven and hell. The timing and details are disputed, but the core hope remains.",
    "output": "Grace and peace to you. As we approach the subject of **Eschatology**—the study of \"last things\"—it is essential to begin where the vast majority of Christians agree.\n\nRegardless of denomination, the core orthodox consensus, affirmed in the Nicene and Apostles’ Creeds, is that Jesus Christ will return to judge the living and the dead, that there will be a bodily resurrection, and that God will establish a New Heaven and a New Earth. The ultimate hope of Christianity is that God wins, evil is defeated, and Christ makes all things new.\n\nHowever, Christians interpret the *timeline* and the *nature* of these events differently. These differences largely hinge on the interpretation of **Revelation 20**, which describes a \"millennium\"—a thousand-year reign of Christ.\n\nHere are the four major Christian views on the end times, presented with respect for their biblical reasoning and historical heritage.\n\n***\n\n### 1. Amillennialism (The \"Now\" Kingdom)\n\n**The Perspective:**\nThe term *a-millennialism* implies \"no millennium,\" but a prominent theologian of this view, Anthony Hoekema, suggested \"Realized Millennialism\" is a better description. This view holds that the \"thousand years\" mentioned in Revelation 20 is a symbolic number representing a long period of time—specifically, the \"Church Age\" between Christ’s first ascension and His second coming.\n\n**Key Beliefs:**\n*   Satan was bound by Christ’s victory on the cross, limiting his ability to deceive the nations and allowing the Gospel to spread.\n*   Christ is reigning *now* in heaven and through His Church on earth spiritually.\n*   They do not expect a literal, political earthly reign of Jesus before the end.\n*   **The End:** Christ will return once. In a single, simultaneous event, the dead will be raised, judgment will occur, and the New Heavens and New Earth will physically commence.\n\n**Who holds this:**\nThis is the historic position of the **Roman Catholic Church**, original **Protestant Reformers** (Luther and Calvin), the **Eastern Orthodox Church**, and many modern **Anglican, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Reformed** bodies.\n\n***\n\n### 2. Postmillennialism (The \"Victorious\" Kingdom)\n\n**The Perspective:**\n*Post*-millennialism teaches that Christ will return *after* the millennium. This view holds an optimistic philosophy of history, believing that the Holy Spirit will gradually advance the Kingdom of God on earth through the preaching of the Gospel.\n\n**Key Beliefs:**\n*   The \"millennium\" may not be a literal 1,000 years, but a golden age of spiritual prosperity and righteousness achieved as the vast majority of the world converts to Christianity.\n*   The world will not end in chaos, but in a state of high Christianization.\n*   **The End:** After this long period of righteousness, Christ returns to a world that has been made ready for Him, followed by the resurrection and judgment.\n\n**Who holds this:**\nThis view was very popular among the **Puritans** and in 18th/19th-century America (including figure such as Jonathan Edwards). While its popularity waned during the World Wars, it maintains a strong following today among certain streams of the **Reformed** tradition and **Christian Reconstructionists**.\n\n***\n\n### 3. Historic Premillennialism (The \"Future\" Kingdom)\n\n**The Perspective:**\n*Pre*-millennialism teaches that Christ returns *before* the millennium to establish a literal earthly reign. The \"Historic\" qualifier distinguishes this view as the one held by many early Church Fathers (like Justin Martyr and Irenaeus) before the rise of Amillennialism.\n\n**Key Beliefs:**\n*   The Church represents the \"spiritual Israel\" but does not replace the promises of a future earthly kingdom.\n*   Society will likely grow worse as the end approaches (Tribulation).\n*   Believers will remain on earth through the Tribulation, suffering alongside the world but sustained by God.\n*   **The End:** Christ returns to earth, resurrects the faithful, and reigns physically for 1,000 years (a literal or long period). Afterward, a final rebellion occurs (Gog and Magog), followed by the final judgment and the New Creation.\n\n**Who holds this:**\nThis view has seen a resurgence in modern times and is found among various **Evangelical** denominations, some **Baptists**, and the **Early Church** historians.\n\n***\n\n### 4. Dispensational Premillennialism (The \"Rapture\" View)\n\n**The Perspective:**\nThis is the most complex and distinct view, largely developed in the 19th century (associated with John Nelson Darby and later the *Scofield Reference Bible*). It emphasizes a strict distinction between **Israel** (the distinct ethnic nation) and the **Church**.\n\n**Key Beliefs:**\n*   God has two distinct plans: one for earthly Israel and one for the spiritual Church.\n*   **The Rapture:** The distinctive feature of this view is the \"Pre-Tribulation Rapture.\" They believe Christ will come *in the air* to snatch away (rapture) true believers before a seven-year period of Great Tribulation on earth.\n*   During the Tribulation, God turns His attention back to ethnic Israel.\n*   **The End:** After the seven years, Christ returns physically (with the Church) to destroy the Antichrist, save national Israel, and establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom in Jerusalem.\n\n**Who holds this:**\nThis is the dominant view in American pop culture (e.g., the *Left Behind* series) and is held by many **Baptists**, **Pentecostals**, **Non-denominational** churches, and **Calvary Chapel** affiliates.\n\n***\n\n### Summary of the \"Blessed Hope\"\n\nWhile these debates can sometimes be heated, it is vital to remember that these are \"in-house\" discussions among the faithful.\n\n*   The **Amillennialist** encourages us to see the spiritual victory of Christ *today*.\n*   The **Postmillennialist** encourages us to trust in the power of the Gospel to transform society.\n*   The **Historic Premillennialist** encourages us to endure suffering with patience.\n*   The **Dispensationalist** encourages us to live with urgency, watching for Christ at any moment.\n\nDespite these differences, all orthodox Christians stand together, looking toward the eastern sky, praying the prayer of the early church: *Maranatha*—\"Come, Lord Jesus.\"",

It preserves core orthodox expectations (Christ’s personal return, bodily resurrection, final judgment, new creation). However, it omits Preterism, a recognized eschatological framework, and could use clearer, more precise articulation of the timing nuances between historic premillennialism and dispensational premillennialism (especially regarding when the rapture occurs relative to the tribulation). Additional nuance around other hermeneutical approaches (preterism, idealism, historicism) would further strengthen the coverage."
