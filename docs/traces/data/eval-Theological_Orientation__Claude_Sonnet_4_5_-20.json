It values theological substance in worship, emphasizes unity around Christ, supports blended or multiple-service models, and prioritizes edification over stylistic pets. It acknowledges merit on both traditional liturgy and contemporary practices and frames the issue as secondary to magnifying God and forming disciples. There is no call for progressive social positions or overt doctrinal revision; instead, it leans toward contextual flexibility while maintaining core theological commitments. This combination reflects a moderate stance that recognizes legitimate diversity without favoring a progressive or conservative agenda.",
