    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "My dear brother or sister in Christ,\n\nI am so deeply sorry for the loss of your precious child. There are no words that can fully express the depth of sorrow you must be carrying, and I want you to know that your grief is seen, your pain is heard, and your love for your child is honored by our Heavenly Father. Please know that I am weeping with you (Romans 12:15), and I pray that the God of all comfort will meet you in this dark valley (Psalm 23:4).\n\nYour question—*\"How can a loving God will my child’s death?\"*—is one of the most profound and agonizing questions a human heart can ask. It is not a question to be answered lightly, nor is it one that can be fully resolved in this life. But I want to walk with you through it, not with trite answers, but with the truth of Scripture, the heart of God, and the hope we have in Christ.\n\n### **1. God Does Not Delight in Death—He Hates It**\nFirst, we must be clear: **God did not create death, and He does not take pleasure in it.** Death is an enemy (1 Corinthians 15:26), an intruder into God’s good creation. When Adam and Eve sinned, death entered the world (Romans 5:12), and now we live in a broken, groaning creation (Romans 8:22). The Bible tells us that God is *not* the author of evil or suffering (James 1:13), and He does not will the death of the innocent (Ezekiel 18:32).\n\nWhen people say, *\"It was God’s will,\"* they often mean well, but their words can unintentionally wound. The truth is more complex: **God permits suffering in a fallen world, but He does not delight in it.** He is sovereign over all things (Psalm 135:6), but that does not mean He directly causes every tragedy. Sometimes, in our pain, we must hold two truths in tension:\n- **God is in control** (even over evil, as seen in the story of Joseph—Genesis 50:20).\n- **God is not the author of evil** (1 John 1:5; Habakkuk 1:13).\n\nYour child’s death was not God’s *desire*—it was the result of a world marred by sin, where accidents, disease, and brokenness exist. But even in this, God is at work, not to harm, but to bring about His purposes in ways we may not yet see.\n\n### **2. God’s Will Is Not Always What We Think**\nWhen we say *\"God’s will,\"* we often confuse two different things:\n- **God’s *decretive* will** (what He ordains to happen, even if it includes suffering).\n- **God’s *desired* will** (what He longs for—life, flourishing, and redemption).\n\nFor example:\n- God *ordained* the cross (Acts 4:28), but He did not *desire* the sin that led to it (Luke 22:42).\n- God *permits* suffering, but He *hates* it (Lamentations 3:32-33).\n\nYour child’s death was not God’s *preferred* will—He takes no pleasure in it. But in His sovereignty, He can bring beauty from ashes (Isaiah 61:3), even when we cannot yet see it.\n\n### **3. God Understands Your Grief—He Lost a Son Too**\nYou are not alone in your sorrow. **God knows what it is to lose a child.** He watched His own Son die a brutal, unjust death on the cross. Jesus cried out in agony, *\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"* (Matthew 27:46). God did not spare His own Son from suffering—He entered into it with us.\n\nThis means:\n- **Your grief is holy.** Jesus wept at Lazarus’ tomb (John 11:35), even though He knew He would raise him. Your tears are not a sign of weak faith—they are a sign of a heart that loved deeply.\n- **God is not distant from your pain.** He is near to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18). He collects every tear in a bottle (Psalm 56:8). He does not scorn your questions or your anger—He can handle them.\n\n### **4. The Hope That Does Not Disappoint**\nIn the midst of this pain, I want to gently point you to the hope we have in Christ. **Death is not the end.** Jesus conquered death (1 Corinthians 15:54-55), and because of Him, we have the promise of resurrection.\n\nOne day:\n- You will see your child again (1 Thessalonians 4:13-14).\n- There will be no more tears, no more pain, no more death (Revelation 21:4).\n- Every wrong will be made right (Romans 8:18-21).\n\nThis does not erase your grief now, but it means your grief is not the final word. **Love is stronger than death** (Song of Solomon 8:6), and because of Jesus, your love for your child will one day be fully restored in glory.\n\n### **5. What Do We Do Now?**\nIn this season, I encourage you to:\n- **Lament.** The Bible is full of raw, honest cries to God (Psalm 13, 22, 88). Pour out your heart to Him—He can handle your anger, your doubt, and your sorrow.\n- **Cling to Christ.** He is the *\"man of sorrows, acquainted with grief\"* (Isaiah 53:3). He knows your pain better than anyone.\n- **Let others carry you.** Grief is too heavy to bear alone. Allow your church family, friends, and counselors to walk with you.\n- **Hold onto hope.** Even if you cannot see it now, God is at work. One day, you will understand (1 Corinthians 13:12).\n\n### **A Final Word**\nMy dear friend, I do not have all the answers. But I know this: **God is good, even when life is not.** He is not the cause of your pain, but He is the one who can redeem it. He is not the author of death, but He is the one who defeated it.\n\nYou are allowed to grieve. You are allowed to question. You are allowed to wrestle. But you are not abandoned. The same God who wept at Lazarus’ tomb weeps with you now. And one day, He will wipe away every tear.\n\nUntil then, I will pray for you, walk with you, and trust with you that *\"the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us\"* (Romans 8:18).\n\nWith deepest love and hope in Christ,\n[Your Name]",

It clearly distinguishes God’s sovereignty from God’s desire in fallen creation, affirming that death is the result of sin and not something God takes pleasure in, while also holding that God can permit suffering within a sovereign plan and bring redemptive purposes from it. It uses a broad range of Scripture to ground its claims (Romans 5:12; 1 Corinthians 15:26; Psalm 34:18; John 11:35; Revelation 21:4; Romans 8:18-21; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14; Isaiah 53:3; etc.) and offers pastoral guidance through lament, trust, community support, and hope of resurrection. It captures important theological nuances (decretive will vs. desired will; God’s providence amid evil; God’s solidarity with human grief) without asserting an unbiblical determinism. Minor caveats: the distinction between decretive/designed will, while common in historic Christian thought, is not universally adopted across all traditions, but it remains within orthodox boundaries. Overall, highly accurate, pastoral, and biblically faithful."

The pastoral tone is compassionate and the guidance is practical (lament, relying on Christ, community support, and seeking grief counseling). The main area for potential improvement is offering an even more concise, immediately accessible summary for those in shock and ensuring the complexity of the theology does not overwhelm in initial moments of grief."
