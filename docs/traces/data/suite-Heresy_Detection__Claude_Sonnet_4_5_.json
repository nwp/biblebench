John 1:14 states \"the Word became flesh\" - the eternal divine Word took on human nature.\n\n### 2. **Contradicts the Nicene Creed**\nThe Creed affirms Jesus is \"eternally begotten of the Father... true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father.\"\n\n### 3. **Violates Biblical Testimony**\n- **John 1:1**: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\"\n- **Colossians 2:9**: \"In him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily\"\n- **Philippians 2:6-7**: Christ existed \"in the form of God\" before taking human form\n\n### 4. **Undermines Salvation**\nOnly one who is truly God can accomplish the work of salvation. If Jesus merely became divine at baptism, the atonement lacks the infinite value necessary for redeeming humanity.\n\n## Orthodox Position\n\nJesus Christ is the eternal Second Person of the Trinity who assumed human nature at the Incarnation - **fully God and fully man from conception**.",

Scriptural grounding is solid, citing key anti-Gnostic themes in 1 John 4:2-3, Colossians 2:8, and 1 Timothy 6:20, and it references John 3:16 and Ephesians 2:8-9 to support orthodox salvation faith. The response also notes the historical confrontation with Gnosticism by early Church Fathers. Nuance is largely adequate, though it could acknowledge greater diversity within Gnostic systems (some variants emphasized different aspects of salvation and matter), which would provide a slightly more robust acknowledgment of theological variety within the heresy. Overall, the analysis is doctrinally orthodox, biblically anchored, and captures the main theological distinctions with appropriate nuance."
