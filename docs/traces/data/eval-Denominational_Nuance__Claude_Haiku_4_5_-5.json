    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",

            "Treats 1 Corinthians 13:8-10 as a single decisive cessationist interpretive key (that 'perfect' refers to Scripture's completion) while this passage is widely debated among scholars; some argue 'perfect' could refer to Christ's return or to maturity of the church, not necessarily the canonization of Scripture.",
            "Some wording assumes 'all gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12-14' continue universally; in practice, continuationist positions often differentiate between categories of gifts (e.g., 'sign gifts' vs. non-sign gifts) and may not affirm every listed gift as actively ongoing in all contexts."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response offers a solid overview of the main positions and includes relevant biblical references, which reflects solid scriptural grounding. However, it enshrines some common but debated points (tongues as definitive evidence, Mark 16:17-18 as a clear canonical proof-text, and a single-dominant interpretation of 1 Cor 13:8-10) without noting significant scholarly and theological caveats. It also treats the continuationist claim about 'all gifts' as universally accepted, whereas many charismatics distinguish between different kinds of gifts. These nuances are important for a precise, biblically cautious treatment. Overall, the answer is accurate and nuanced but could improve by acknowledging manuscript issues, broader interpretive debates, and intra-tradition diversity."

          "explanation": "The response is largely balanced, presenting both Charismatic/Pentecostal and Cessationist perspectives and noting common ground. However, it uses phrasing that could be read as more critical of cessationist positions (e.g., claiming their claims “often lack biblical support or involve fraud/psychology”) and foregrounds tongues as evidence of the Spirit, which aligns with Charismatic theology. Overall, there is no explicit endorsement of one tradition over the other, and middle-ground positions are acknowledged, yielding a mostly ecumenical approach with a minor lean toward ongoing gifts."
