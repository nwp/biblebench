    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "This teaching, often referred to as the \"Lorenzo Snow couplet,\" serves as a concise summary of the doctrine of **Eternal Progression**, a core theological tenet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS).\n\nTo analyze this respectfully and accurately, we must break the couplet into its two distinct claims and compare them against historical, orthodox Christian theology (defined here by the consensus of the early Church Councils, such as Nicaea and Chalcedon, and the traditions of Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant Christianity).\n\n### Part 1: \"As man now is, God once was.\"\n\n**LDS Theology:**\nThis phrase asserts that God the Father was not always God. Instead, He was once a mortal being who lived on an earth, presumably underwent a process of testing and growth, and eventually attained exaltation/godhood. It implies that God has a physical body of flesh and bone (Doctrine and Covenants 130:22) and exists within time and space, subject to a progression of His own.\n\n**Orthodox Christian Theology:**\nThis concept represents a fundamental departure from orthodox Christian doctrine regarding the nature of God.\n\n1.  **Aseity and Eternality:** Orthodox theology holds that God is the *Uncreated Creator*. He is defined by *aseity* (self-existence). He has no beginning and no end (Psalm 90:2). There was never a time when God was not God.\n2.  **Immutability:** Classical Christian theism teaches that God is immutable (unchanging) in His essence (Malachi 3:6, James 1:17). He does not \"progress\" from a lower state to a higher state; He is perfection itself.\n3.  **Spirituality:** Jesus teaches in the Gospel of John that \"God is spirit\" (John 4:24). While the Second Person of the Trinity (Jesus) took on a human body in the Incarnation, orthodox theology maintains that God the Father is immaterial and infinite, not confined to a physical form.\n\n**Conclusion on Part 1:**\nThis portion of the teaching is **inconsistent** with orthodox Christian theology. Orthodoxy rejects the idea that God the Father arguably evolved from a human state or that He is one of a lineage of gods. It maintains a strict Creator-creature distinction: God is the unique, uncreated source of all reality, not an exalted creature.\n\n***\n\n### Part 2: \"As God now is, man may become.\"\n\n**LDS Theology:**\nThis phrase refers to the doctrine of **Exaltation**. It teaches that faithful human beings have the potential to become gods. This involves inheriting all that the Father has, including the power to create, rule over worlds, and continue the family unit eternally. It views humanity as literal spirit children of God with the same species/nature as God, currently in an embryonic state.\n\n**Orthodox Christian Theology:**\nThis area requires a nuanced analysis, as there are linguistic similarities but deep metaphysical differences.\n\n1.  **Theosis / Deification:** In Eastern Orthodox theology (and to varying degrees in Western traditions), there is a doctrine called *theosis*. Church Fathers like St. Athanasius famously said, \"God became man that man might become god.\" This sounds very similar to the LDS couplet.\n2.  **The Creator-Creature Distinction:** However, the meaning of \"becoming god\" differs radically.\n    *   **Orthodox View:** Humans \"become god\" by *participation* and *grace*, not by *nature*. We become like God in His moral character (holiness, love, immortality) and participate in His divine life (2 Peter 1:4). However, a human never becomes a self-existent creator; humans remain forever created beings. We never become the object of worship.\n    *   **LDS View:** The LDS understanding suggests an ontological change where humans effectively join the class of beings that God belongs to. Because LDS theology rejects the immense gap between Creator and creature (seeing them as the same species at different stages), the potential for divinity is more literal and more comprehensive than the orthodox view of sanctification.\n\n**Conclusion on Part 2:**\nWhile there is a superficial agreement in language (both speak of humans partaking in divinity), the underlying metaphysics render the teaching **inconsistent** with orthodoxy. Orthodox theology maintains that humans will be glorified but will never cross the ontological abyss to become independent deities equal in nature to the Uncreated God.\n\n***\n\n### Summary Analysis\n\nThe couplet \"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become\" implies a worldview often categorized theologically as **henotheism** or **monolatry** (the worship of one God among many potential gods), combined with a materialistic view of the divine beings (God has a body).\n\n**Points of Agreement:**\n*   Both traditions agree that human beings have a divine destiny and are meant to be glorified and transformed into the image of Christ.\n*   Both agree that this process is only possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\n\n**Points of Departure:**\n*   **The Nature of God:** Orthodoxy views God as the uncaused First Cause, eternally God. LDS theology views God as an exalted man with a history of progression.\n*   **The Nature of Man:** Orthodoxy views man as a created being distinct from the Creator. LDS theology views man as co-eternal with God (in terms of intelligence/spirit matter) and of the same species.\n\n**Final Verdict:**\nThe teaching is **not consistent** with orthodox Christian theology. It collapses the essential distinction between the Uncreated God and the created order, altering the definitions of both God and humanity in ways that the historic Christian creeds (Nicene, Apostles', Athanasian) explicitly exclude.",

            "The response treats the Lorenzo Snow couplet as an explicit, uniform LDS doctrine about God being mortal and progressing in all LDS teaching. In reality, there is variation within LDS interpretation, and the couplet is historically tied to a particular interpretiveTradition; some LDS adherents may not affirm the exact progression implied. This makes the characterization somewhat oversimplified.",
            "The label of the couplet as potentially indicating henotheism/monolatry is arguable and not universally accepted as a precise theological category for LDS belief. While not fatal, this adds a contested nuance that could mislead readers who expect a standard, uncontested taxonomy.",
            "Overall, a minor caveat about the uniformity of the LDS claim could improve precision."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer accurately identifies the core orthodox critique: God is eternal, unchanging, and the Creator, while humans are created and do not become deities in the LDS sense. It correctly notes the orthodox counterpart to theosis (participation by grace, without changing the ontological nature of God). It grounds the discussion in scripture and historic creeds, and it distinguishes between participation in divine life and becoming a self-existent creator. The main area for improvement is a more precise handling of LDS doctrinal variations and the contested use of terms like henotheism; these are nuanced issues that should be framed as interpretive sensitivities rather than definitive categories."
