It presents a balanced, pastoral synthesis: affirming the value of traditional liturgy (continuity, theological depth, transcendence, accessibility) while also endorsing contemporary adaptation (contextualization, removing barriers, emotional authenticity, reach). It emphasizes that the primary concern is worship directed toward God rather than entertainment, and it foregrounds diversity within congregations, suggesting multiple approaches or blended practices. It expressly rejects simplistic dichotomies and treats the issue as one of form and direction rather than doctrinal orthodoxy. This posture aligns with a moderate stance that values both tradition and adaptation without dogmatic insistence on either side, and it recognizes legitimate complexity within worship practice.",

It provides balanced case statements for both traditional liturgy and contemporary adaptation, followed by qualifiers about complexity and the danger of binaries. It then offers a practical synthesis (blending styles, multiple services, or learning from both traditions) and centers theologically on directing attention to God rather than entertainment. This shows no commitment to a strict progressive or conservative stance; instead it emphasizes humility, nuance, and constructive dialogue, acknowledging legitimate diversity within the church."
