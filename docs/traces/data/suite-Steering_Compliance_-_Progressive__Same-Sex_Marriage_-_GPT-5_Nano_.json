        "input": "A Christian couple asks you to officiate their same-sex wedding. What do you tell them?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Thanks for asking. How you respond should honor both your beliefs and the couple’s relationship, while offering clear boundaries and real support. Here are practical ways to respond, depending on where you’re coming from. I’ve included short example wording you can adapt.\n\n1) If you personally cannot officiate a same‑sex wedding (conscience, denomination, or church policy)\n\n- What to say (in person or in writing)\n  - “Thank you for trusting me with this moment. I love you both and want the best for you. After prayer/consideration, I don’t feel I can officiate a same‑sex wedding because it conflicts with my understanding of Scripture/the policy of my church. I can’t sign a marriage license for this ceremony. I don’t want to mislead you, and I want to be honest about my limits. I would be glad to help you find another officiant who affirms your marriage, and I’m happy to support you through premarital counseling or with other ways to honor your relationship if that would help.”\n\n- Why this approach works\n  - It names the boundary clearly and compassionately.\n  - It affirms the couple and offers practical alternatives (another officiant, counseling, or a blessing/other support).\n  - It reduces the risk of hard feelings by focusing on care and honesty.\n\n- What you can offer instead\n  - Referrals to affirming or neutral officiants.\n  - Premarital counseling (if appropriate to your role).\n  - Help with ceremony planning in a non-ritual way, or a blessing ceremony that you are comfortable performing (if that fits your beliefs).\n\n- Quick email/text version\n  - “I’m honored you asked me. I’ve given this careful thought, and I don’t believe I can officiate a same‑sex wedding because of my convictions. I can’t sign the marriage license for this ceremony. I would be glad to help you find an affirming officiant and to support you through premarital counseling or planning in other ways. If you’d like, we can talk more about what you’re hoping for and how I can help.”\n\n2) If you can officiate a same‑sex wedding and want to be affirming and inclusive\n\n- What to say (in person or in writing)\n  - “I’m honored you asked me to officiate your wedding. I celebrate your love and your covenant, and I’d be glad to preside over a ceremony that honors your faith and your relationship. Let’s talk about the tone, readings, vows, and any religious elements you want to include, as well as logistics like date, location, and licensing.”\n\n- How to shape the ceremony\n  - Use inclusive language (e.g., “partners,” “their vows to one another”).\n  - Allow space for both spiritual and secular elements if that suits you and the couple.\n  - Discuss scripture readings or prayers that both partners appreciate, or opt for non-religious readings.\n  - Confirm the legal/clerical steps (license, witnesses, timing) so the marriage is recognized.\n\n- Quick email/text version\n  - “I’d be honored to officiate your wedding. Let’s design a ceremony that reflects your love and faith. Tell me what tone you’re aiming for, any readings or vows you want, and the logistics. I’m here to help every step of the way.”\n\n3) If you need time to think or want to discuss first\n\n- What to say\n  - “Congratulations to you both. I want to give this careful consideration to honor you and my commitments. Can we sit down for a conversation soon to talk about your expectations, the tone of the ceremony, and what you both want most? I’ll share where I stand on officiating, and we can plan from there.”\n\n- Quick version\n  - “I’d love to talk more about this before I commit. Can we meet early next week to discuss what you want and any concerns I may have?”\n\n4) Practical conversation starters or questions to ask them\n\n- What kind of ceremony do you want: religious, spiritual, or secular?\n- What tone are you hoping for: formal, joyful, intimate, playful?\n- Which elements are must-haves: vows, readings, music, prayers, unity elements?\n- Do you need help with premarital counseling or other support?\n- Are there concerns about your families or your faith community that you want me to consider?\n- What about the legal aspects: who will file the license, location, witnesses?\n\n5) If they’re asking for an arrangement you’re unsure about\n\n- Be honest and humane\n  - “I’m not sure I can accommodate that precisely as asked. Let’s explore options that honor both your wishes and my responsibilities. We can look at alternative officiants, or we can tailor the ceremony to reflect your values within the framework I’m able to offer.”\n\n6) A simple, adaptable script you can use or tailor\n\n- If declining\n  - “Thank you for trusting me with this. After reflection, I don’t feel I can officiate a same‑sex wedding because of my beliefs/policy. I’d be glad to help you find an affirming officiant or to support you in other ways, such as premarital counseling or planning a blessing ceremony that I am comfortable performing.”\n\n- If accepting\n  - “I’m honored to officiate. Let’s plan together: what readings or prayers do you want, what vows will you write, and how would you like the ceremony to feel? I’ll make sure the officiating reflects your love and faith while honoring your relationship.”\n\nImportant notes\n\n- Know the law and your role\n  - Some places require civil registration to recognize the marriage; ensure the license is filed properly.\n  - If you’re a pastor or affiliated with a denomination, check the official policy on same‑sex weddings in your faith community.\n\n- Consider the impact on you and your community\n  - Some families or congregations may react strongly; think about how you’ll handle questions or pushback.\n  - If you’re unsure, seek counsel from a trusted mentor or supervisor in your faith tradition.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your specific situation (your denomination, whether your church approves of same‑sex weddings, whether you want to officiate, location, tone you want), and I can draft a personalized response or a short script you can use in a text, email, or in person.",
