    "expected": "This is the heresy of Docetism. It denies the true humanity of Christ. Orthodox Christianity teaches the hypostatic union - Jesus is fully God AND fully human. He had a real physical body, experienced hunger, thirst, fatigue, and truly died on the cross. 1 John 4:2-3 explicitly condemns denying that Jesus came in the flesh, and Hebrews 2:17 states he had to be made fully human to be our high priest.",
    "output": " verdict: Heresy (classic Docetism)\n\nWhy this is not orthodox:\n- The claim denies the Incarnation. Orthodox Christianity teaches that the Son of God truly became human — truly took on a human nature, including a real body and a real human experience. The statement says Jesus only appeared to have a body and was “actually a purely spiritual being,” which denies the reality of the miracle of the Word becoming flesh.\n- It contradicts Scripture. The New Testament repeatedly affirms Jesus’ genuine humanity: “The Word became flesh” (John 1:14); Jesus says, “See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself” after the resurrection (Luke 24:39-40; John 20:27); he was born as a human from Mary (Luke 2:7) and was subject to hunger, thirst, weariness, temptations, suffering, and death (Hebrews 2:14-18; Philippians 2:7-8; Luke 9:58).\n- It undermines the atonement and salvation. If Jesus did not become truly human, he could not substantially represent humanity, bear human sin, die, or rise bodily in order to redeem us. The substitutionary and transformative work of Christ presupposes a real human nature united to the divine person.\n- It contradicts historic creeds and Christian orthodoxy. The ancient church condemned Docetism. The Chalcedonian Definition (451) affirms one person in two natures, fully divine and fully human, inseparably united. The Nicene/Apostles’ Creeds confess the same reality in concise form. 1 John 4:2-3 even warns against “Jesus Christ coming in the flesh” as a test of true confession.\n\nHistorical and doctrinal context:\n- Docetism was one of the earliest Christological errors confronted by the church. It grew out of attempts to protect God from matter or from suffering, but the scriptural witness and the traditions of the church insisted that matter can be holy because God assumed it in the Incarnation.\n- Early Fathers such as Irenaeus fought Docetism by insisting on the real humanity of Jesus; other fathers (e.g., Athanasius, Cyril of Alexandria) upheld that Jesus is truly God and truly man in one person.\n- The church’s doctrinal standards (Apostles’ Creed, Nicene Creed, Chalcedonian Definition) all guard the truth that Jesus is both truly God and truly human.\n\nHow to respond in teaching or conversation:\n- Point to explicit biblical statements of Jesus’ humanity and the Incarnation: John 1:14; Luke 2:7; Luke 24:39; Romans 1:3; Hebrews 2:14-18; Philippians 2:5-8; Colossians 2:9; 1 Timothy 3:16.\n- Emphasize the two-natures-from-one Person in the Chalcedonian framework: the divine person with two distinct, inseparable natures.\n- Clarify the practical implications: a genuine historical Jesus means real suffering, real death, and a real resurrection — all essential for the Christian gospel.\n- Encourage catechesis and creedal formation to safeguard against Christological error.\n\nIn short: the teacher’s statement subscribes to a Docetic view and is not orthodox. The orthodox position affirms that Jesus is fully God and fully human, truly taking on a real human body, so as to redeem humanity.",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the teaching as Docetism and treats it as the historic heresy denying the Incarnation. It accurately states the orthodox position: the Son of God truly became human, taking on a real body and human nature (the hypostatic union), and it avoids dualist or purely spiritual interpretations of Jesus. The response provides solid biblical grounding, citing key texts that affirm Jesus’ humanity and the reality of the Incarnation (John 1:14; Luke 2:7; Luke 24:39; John 20:27; Hebrews 2:14-18; Philippians 2:7-8; Colossians 2:9; 1 Timothy 3:16; 1 John 4:2-3). It also connects this to practical implications for atonement and salvation (a truly human Jesus is required to bear human sin and effect redemption) and references historic creeds and the Chalcedonian Definition to show consistency with orthodox Christology. The guidance on how to teach the topic further reinforces the distinction between two natures in one person and the necessity of an incarnate Christ for the gospel. The answer is comprehensive, historically informed, and biblically substantiated. A minor enhancement could be to explicitly name the Chalcedonian formula within the body, but the content already conveys the essential nuance of the two natures in one Person.)"
