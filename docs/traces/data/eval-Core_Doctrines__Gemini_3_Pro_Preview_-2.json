    "expected": "Justification by faith is the doctrine that sinners are declared righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus Christ, not by their own works or merit. It is a legal declaration by God where the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, and their sins are forgiven. This justification is received through faith alone (sola fide), by grace alone (sola gratia), based on Christ's finished work alone (solus Christus).",
    "output": "Here is a systematic, theological explanation of the doctrine of Justification by Faith.\n\n### Introduction: The Hinge of Salvation\nIn systematic theology, **Justification** is the legal declaration by God that a sinner is righteous. It is traditionally regarded by Protestants as \"the article upon which the church stands or falls\" (*articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiae*).\n\nTo understand how someone becomes righteous before God, we must answer three questions: What is the legal problem? What is the basis of the solution? And how is that solution applied to the individual?\n\n### 1. The Legal Problem: Universal Guilt\nBefore we can understand justification, we must understand the biblical diagnosis of humanity.\n*   **The Standard:** God is infinitely holy and just. His law demands perfect obedience.\n*   **The Reality:** \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23).\n*   **The Dilemma:** God cannot simply overlook sin, for doing so would compromise His justice (Proverbs 17:15). Therefore, humanity stands condemned in a cosmic courtroom, guilty and without the ability to pay the penalty or generate the righteousness required to dwell in God's presence.\n\n### 2. The Nature of Justification: A Forensic Declaration\nThe biblical Greek word for justify, *dikaioō*, is a **forensic** (legal) term. It does not mean \"to make someone internally good\" (which is the separate process of *Sanctification*), but rather \"to declare someone righteous\" in a legal sense.\n\nWhen God justifies a sinner, He issues a verdict. He declares that the person is:\n1.  **Forgiven:** The penalty of the law has been satisfied; the person is \"not guilty.\"\n2.  **Righteous:** The person is regarded as having kept the law perfectly.\n\n### 3. The Ground of Justification: The Imputation of Christ’s Righteousness\nIf we are sinners, how can God legally declare us righteous without lying? He does this not based on our own intrinsic morality, but based on the work of Jesus Christ. This occurs through a theological mechanism known as **Double Imputation** (The Great Exchange):\n\n*   **Our Sin Imputed to Christ:** On the cross, the guilt of the believer was credited (imputed) to Jesus. He bore the wrath of God as a substitute. \"He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree\" (1 Peter 2:24).\n*   **Christ’s Righteousness Imputed to Us:** Conversely, the perfect obedience of Jesus—His distinct life of fulfilling the Law—is credited to the believer’s account.\n\nThe Apostle Paul summarizes this in 2 Corinthians 5:21: *\"For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\"*\n\nTherefore, the believer possesses an **alien righteousness** (*iustitia aliena*)—a righteousness that is not their own, but is essentially Christ's righteousness worn like a robe (Isaiah 61:10, Philippians 3:9).\n\n### 4. The Instrument of Justification: Faith Alone (*Sola Fide*)\nHow does a person receive this specific righteousness? The Bible is emphatic that it is received by **faith alone**, apart from works of the law.\n\n*   *\"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast\"* (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n*   *\"And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness\"* (Romans 4:5).\n\n**What is saving faith?**\nTheologically, faith is the *instrumental cause* of justification. Imagine a beggar reaching out an empty hand to accept a gold coin from a king. The hand (faith) does not create the gold; it only receives it. Faith is the act of looking away from one's own merit and trusting entirely in the merit of Christ.\n\nSaving faith consists of three elements:\n1.  **Notitia (Knowledge):** Understanding the facts of the Gospel.\n2.  **Assensus (Assent):** Agreeing that these facts are true.\n3.  **Fiducia (Trust):** A personal reliance on Christ alone for salvation.\n\n### 5. The Relationship Between Faith and Works\nA common misunderstanding is that if works do not save us, we are free to continue struggling in sin without consequence (Antinomianism). However, biblical theology distinguishes between *justification* and *sanctification* without separating them.\n\nWhile we are justified by faith *alone*, the faith that justifies is *never alone*.\n*   **Justification** is the root: Our legal standing before God changes instantly upon belief.\n*   **Good Works** are the fruit: Because the Holy Spirit regenerates the justified sinner, their life will inevitably begin to change.\n\nAs James 2:17 states, \"Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.\" James is arguing that a claim to faith that produces no life change is a false faith. However, the works themselves contribute nothing to the legal verdict of justification; they are merely the evidence that the verdict has been rendered.\n\n### Summary\nTo be righteous before God is not to achieve a level of moral perfection through human effort. Rather, it is to be united to Christ through faith. By trusting in Him, God credits Christ’s perfect obedience to your account and Christ’s death to your debt.\n\nTherefore, we have \"peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\" (Romans 5:1), resting secure not in what we have done, but in what He has done for us.",

            "The response centers on 'imputation' and 'double imputation' (alien righteousness) as the core mechanism. While this is a classic Protestant articulation, some traditions (e.g., Roman Catholic and some Orthodox theologies) would emphasize different nuances (e.g., infused righteousness or transformation) within justification and sanctification. A brief note acknowledging these broader perspectives would improve balance."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns closely with historic Protestant-orthodox teaching on justification: forensic declaration, grounding in Christ’s redemptive work, imputation of Christ’s righteousness, forgiveness of sins, faith as the instrument, and the distinction between justification and sanctification. It cites key scriptures (Rom 4:5; Eph 2:8–9; 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 3:23; James 2:17) and articulates the usual distinctions (alien righteousness, not by works, faith alone, fruit of faith). Minor points for improvement include prioritizing Romans 3:25–26 over Proverbs 17:15 for the justice of God and noting broader Christian perspectives that differ on the exact mode of righteousness (imputation vs impartation) without negating the core justification framework."

          ],
          "explanation": "Overall, the response reflects classic Protestant soteriology: justification by faith alone (sola fide), forensic justification, and imputed righteousness (iustitia aliena) through Christ. It correctly distinguishes justification from sanctification and cites key scriptures. The main concerns are interpretive differences among traditions (e.g., Catholic/Orthodox understandings of infused righteousness and the relative order of regeneration/justification) and a wording nuance that could imply justification occurs after regeneration. These are not heresies, but are debates that distinguish historic confessional positions. The treatment of faith as the instrumental cause and the emphasis on 'the not guilty' verdict are consistent with orthodox Protestant doctrine."
