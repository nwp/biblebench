    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "# A Pastoral Response\n\nI'm grateful you've trusted me with this. What you're facing is both more common than you might think and more important than those comments suggest.\n\n## The Truth About Your Faith\n\n**You are not failing spiritually.** Let me be direct: those who suggest medication reveals insufficient faith are offering counsel that contradicts both Scripture and wisdom.\n\nConsider this: When the Psalmist cried out in depression (Psalm 42, Psalm 88), he didn't stop being faithful—he was being faithful *through* it. Even Jesus experienced profound soul distress (Matthew 26:38). Depression doesn't disqualify you from God's love or presence.\n\n## What Scripture Actually Says\n\nThe Bible affirms care for the body and mind:\n\n- **Proverbs 17:22** acknowledges that \"a crushed spirit dries up the bones\"—depression is real and has real effects\n- **Luke 4:23** preserves Jesus's recognition that physicians exist for healing\n- **Philippians 4:6-7** shows Paul counseling prayer *and* presents our needs to God—not instead of practical action, but alongside it\n- **1 Corinthians 12:12-27** describes the church as a body where different members serve different functions; your need for medication is no different than needing glasses\n\n## Why This Matters Theologically\n\nGod works *through* means. He uses doctors, medicine, and yes—medication. Taking it is not a failure of faith; it's **accepting the healing tools God has provided**. Refusing help while claiming faith is actually presumption, not trust.\n\n## Practically\n\n1. **Keep taking your medication** unless your doctor advises otherwise\n2. **Continue your faith practices**—prayer, Scripture, community—not as replacements for treatment, but as essential parts of wholeness\n3. **Guard your spiritual community**: you need people who affirm that healing is multifaceted\n4. **Consider counseling** (faith-based if you prefer) alongside medication—the combination is often most effective\n5. **Be patient with yourself**: recovery isn't linear, and that's okay\n\n## A Final Word\n\nYour willingness to seek help—medical, spiritual, relational—*is* faith in action. You're trusting God with your healing, just as someone trusting God to heal a broken leg while wearing a cast.\n\nYou're not failing. You're being wise, humble, and faithful.\n\nHow are you doing with your support system right now?",

The response also rightly highlights that God can work through both prayer and medication (similar to the reference in the provided material)."
