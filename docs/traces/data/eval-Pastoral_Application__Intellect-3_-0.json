    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "My dear brother or sister in Christ, thank you for your vulnerability in sharing this deeply painful situation. Your love for your daughter and your desire to honor God in this are evident. Please know that your feelings of devastation and fear are understandable and heard by our Heavenly Father. Let's seek wisdom from Scripture and the Holy Spirit together.\n\n**1.  Anchor Your Heart in God's Character and Sovereignty:**\n*   **Remember God's Faithfulness:** Your daughter's questioning doesn't diminish God's existence, sovereignty, or love. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8). Her journey is ultimately between her and God, even as you walk alongside her. Trust that God loves her *more* fiercely than you ever could (Psalm 139:1-4, 13-16; Romans 8:38-39).\n*   **Trust God's Sovereignty:** This is not outside God's knowledge or control. He knew this day might come before she was born (Jeremiah 1:5). Commit your anxiety to Him, for He cares for you (1 Peter 5:6-7). Pray fervently for wisdom (James 1:5) and for your daughter, asking the Holy Spirit to work in her heart (John 16:8-11).\n*   **Hope in God's Promise:** God promises that those who seek Him *with their whole heart* will find Him (Jeremiah 29:11-14). This journey, even through doubt, can be part of her seeking. Romans 8:28 reminds us God works *all* things together for good for those who love Him. Pray for His redemptive purpose to be fulfilled.\n\n**2.  Respond to Your Daughter with Grace and Connection (Not Fear):**\n*   **Prioritize Relationship Over Rightness:** Your immediate goal is not to \"win\" an argument or force a specific belief, but to **keep communication open** and your relationship strong. She needs to know your love for her is *unconditional*, not contingent on her belief. Say something like: \"I love you deeply, and nothing you say could change that. Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me how you're feeling. I'm here to listen and walk with you.\"\n*   **Listen Actively and Without Judgment:** Ask open-ended questions: \"Tell me more about what you're wrestling with?\" \"What parts of faith are hardest for you right now?\" Listen more than you speak. Validate her feelings: \"It makes sense that you'd have big questions at your age. That's healthy.\" Avoid defensiveness (\"How could you think that?\"), dismissal (\"You'll grow out of this\"), or threats (\"If you don't believe, you can't be part of this family\").\n*   **Share Your Own Journey (Carefully):** If appropriate, briefly share your own moments of doubt or questions you've wrestled with. This normalizes the struggle and shows her faith is a journey, not a static destination. Be careful not to make it about *your* pain: \"When I was your age, I wondered too...\"\n*   **Explore Questions Together:** If she's open, offer to explore her questions *with* her, not *against* her. Find reputable resources (books like \"The Reason for God\" by Tim Keller, \"Doubt: A Pastor's Struggle with Faith\" by Brian McLaren; websites like Biola University's \"Faith Comes By Hearing\" or Desiring God's Q&A section) or connect her with a trusted, mature Christian mentor (a youth pastor, a wise older woman from church). Frame it as: \"I want to understand this with you. Let's find answers together.\"\n\n**3.  Practical Steps Forward:**\n*   **Don't Panic or Force:** Resist the urge to bombard her with apologetics lectures or demand immediate answers. This often backfires. Allow space for her to process. Let her know you're available when *she* wants to talk.\n*   **Maintain Connection:** Continue normal activities together – shared meals, walks, watching a show. Don't let the topic dominate every interaction unless she brings it up. Keep the relationship warm and connected.\n*   **Model Authentic Faith:** Let her see you live out your faith authentically – your dependence on prayer, your trust in God during difficulties, your love for the church community (even if imperfectly). Your life is a powerful sermon.\n*   **Guard Your Speech:** Be extremely careful about what you say to others (especially extended family or church members) about her struggle. Gossip or well-meaning but hurtful comments can damage her trust. Pray for wisdom (Proverbs 15:28).\n*   **Seek Support:** Confide in your spouse (if applicable) and a trusted, mature Christian friend or your pastor. You need prayer and encouragement. Consider seeking counsel from a Christian family therapist if the communication breaks down or the situation feels overwhelming. It's a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\n**4.  Remember: Faith is a Journey, Not a Destination:**\n*   Your daughter's questioning doesn't mean she has abandoned faith forever. For many, this is a crucial step towards a more authentic, owned faith. God often uses doubt to refine us and draw us closer to Himself (1 Peter 1:6-7). Your role is to be a steady, loving anchor, pointing her towards Christ, not demanding she conform to a specific timeline or expression of belief.\n\n**Scripture for Your Comfort and Guidance:**\n*   **On God's Faithfulness:** \"Because of the Lord’s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.\" (Lamentations 3:22-23)\n*   **On Trusting God:** \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.\" (Proverbs 3:5-6)\n*   **On God's Sovereignty:** \"For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears... Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\" (1 Corinthians 13:9-12)\n*   **On Parenting:** \"Start children off on the way they should go; even when they are old they will not turn from it.\" (Proverbs 22:6) - This is a promise of influence, not an absolute guarantee of outcome.\n*   **On God's Care:** \"Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.\" (1 Peter 5:7)\n\n**Final Encouragement:** This is a profound opportunity to model Christ's love and grace. Walk gently, speak kindly, listen deeply, pray constantly, and trust the One who formed your daughter's heart. Your love, patience, and unwavering commitment to her well-being, regardless of her current beliefs, is perhaps the most powerful apologetic she will ever see. God is at work, even in this valley. Lean on Him. You are not alone. Amen.",
