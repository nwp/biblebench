        "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
        "output": "I’m so glad you reached out. This is a deeply tender moment for you and for your daughter, and your desire to respond with both truth and love matters a lot. Doubt among teenagers is common, and it can become a doorway into a firmer, more resilient faith if navigated with grace and honesty. Here’s a way to respond that is biblically grounded, pastorally gentle, and practically doable.\n\n1) In the immediate moment: listen, affirm, and resist panic\n- Say less, listen more. Give her space to name what she’s feeling without closing doors with quick fixes or guilt.\n- Validate her feelings: “I’m devastated to hear you’re hurting this much. It’s okay to have questions and to be unsure right now.”\n- Communicate safety and love: “I love you regardless of what you believe. I’m here to walk with you, not to pressure you to think a certain way.”\n- Avoid shaming or belittling doubt. Do not pile on guilt or pretend certainty you don’t feel yourself.\n\n2) Create a safe space for questions to be explored\n- Tell her you want to understand her questions and help her seek honest answers.\n- Offer a structure that minimizes pressure: weekly check-ins, a shared reading list, or a “question box” where she can drop questions she wants to discuss.\n- Normalize questions as part of growing faith: doubt is not the enemy of faith if it leads to truth and trust in God.\n\n3) Practical next steps you can take together\n- Name the questions: Invite her to tell you her top questions (about God, the church, science, suffering, doubt, identity, etc.). Write them down and tackle one or two at a time.\n- Read and discuss together: pick short, thoughtful passages that speak to doubt, longing, and God’s faithfulness. For example:\n  - Mark 9:24 “I believe; help my unbelief” to acknowledge both faith and doubt.\n  - Psalm 13 and Psalm 22 for honest lament before God.\n  - Hebrews 11 (faith and imperfect people) and Romans 8:28-39 on God’s good purposes in pain.\n  - John 14:6 and John 20:29 for trust in Jesus as the way to life, even when we don’t see clearly.\n  - 1 Thessalonians 5:21 and Proverbs 18:15 about testing and seeking understanding.\n- Involve trustworthy mentors: a compassionate youth pastor, a respected adult in the church, a college ministry mentor, or a Christian counselor if there are heavy emotional wounds or questions that feel overwhelming.\n- Encourage faithful practices that invite encounter with God, not just answers: prayer, journaling questions, and worship together (even if she’s unsure about beliefs).\n\n4) Speak truth with grace about core beliefs\n- Reaffirm the gospel gently: God loves you, the good news of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection, and the invitation to know God personally.\n- Acknowledge the reality of pain and doubt: the Bible contains honest cries to God in suffering (Lament Psalms, Job) and also anchors trust in God’s character and promises.\n- Emphasize God’s faithfulness over our certainty: even when we don’t understand, God remains trustworthy (Psalm 33:4; Lamentations 3:22-23; Romans 8:28-39).\n\n5) Conversation prompts you can use\n- “What questions are you most afraid to ask God or us about?”\n- “What would help you feel safe to explore those questions with me?”\n- “If you could see one honest answer from God about this, what would it have to include for you to feel okay with it?”\n- “I don’t expect you to have all the answers. Would you be willing to search for truth with me, even if it changes what you believe?”\n- “What’s one thing about faith you do feel certain about, and one thing you’re not sure of?”\n\n6) A family and church plan for the next 6–12 weeks\n- Week 1–2: Have a heartfelt, low-stakes conversation, agreeing to listen more than argue. Set up a regular weekly check-in.\n- Week 3–6: Read and discuss one question at a time; involve a trusted mentor or counselor if helpful. Consider a short youth-appropriate resource or a book on doubt and faith (chosen with discernment).\n- Week 6–12: Evaluate progress. Are there questions you can own and feel comfortable discussing with others? Is there a place in the church or in a youth group where she can belong even if her beliefs are in transition?\n- Ongoing: Make space for Sabbath-like rhythm and small acts of spiritual practice (family meal with prayer, worship nights, service together) that build shared memory and belonging.\n\n7) When to seek professional help\n- If she expresses ongoing despair, thoughts of harming herself, or extreme hopelessness, gently urge and arrange immediate professional help (a counselor, clinician). Your pastor or church can help coordinate care in these moments.\n- If anxiety, depression, or social withdrawal seems significant, don’t wait to seek help.\n\n8) What you can model as a parent\n- Honesty about doubt in your own life, when appropriate: “I don’t have all the answers, but I’m choosing to seek God and learn with you.”\n- Consistency in love: show up, listen, follow through, and resist manipulation or fear-based reactions.\n- Boundaries that cultivate trust: you can be clear about core beliefs while giving her space to explore and grow into her own convictions.\n\n9) A brief prayer you can share or pray with her\n- Lord, you are patient with us in our questions and our doubts. Please meet [daughter’s name] in her questions and guide her toward truth, love, and life in you. Give me grace to listen well, courage to tell the truth in love, and the wisdom to walk with her whatever path she takes. Amen.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit more about the kinds of questions she’s raising (e.g., about God’s existence, the problem of suffering, church hurt, science and faith, moral questions). I can tailor a short, teen-friendly reading plan, conversation starters, and a week-by-week plan that fits your family and your church context.\n\nAnd know this: many faithful people—biblical heroes included—have walked through doubt and emerged with a more robust, intimate trust in God. God meets us in the wrestling, not merely in the resolution. You’re modeling a hopeful path: to question, to seek, and to remain in relationship with God and with one another. I’m praying for you, your daughter, and your whole family as you navigate this season.",

Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
        "output": "I’m glad you asked this. It’s a brave, honest question, and it’s one Jesus’ people have grappled with for centuries. Let me speak plainly and gently, from Scripture and with pastoral care.\n\nCan I be a Christian and experience these feelings?\n- Yes. Being a Christian does not require erasing or pretending away your feelings. Temptations and attractions are not, in themselves, sins. Temptations are things you bring to God and ask Him to help you navigate.\n- The Bible speaks of the reality of human desires and the call to live in faithfulness to God’s design. You can be a follower of Jesus while you wrestle with same-sex attraction (SSA). What matters is how you respond to that reality—whether you seek to obey God, rely on His grace, and grow in holiness with His help, or whether you indulge what He forbids apart from repentance and grace.\n\nDoes God hate me?\n- No. God does not hate you. He loves you with an everlasting love. He knows you intimately (Psalm 139) and desires you to know His mercy and presence.\n- God hates sin because sin hurts you and others and breaks His perfect design. He does not hate you for having attractions; He invites you to bring all of who you are into His light and to walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7).\n\nBiblical framing to hold onto\n- Identity in Christ: If you are in Christ, you are a beloved child of God and, in Christ, a new creation. Your value comes from being made in God’s image and redeemed by Jesus (John 1:12; 2 Corinthians 5:17).\n- Temptation vs. sin: Temptations themselves are not sin. Sin is indulging or acting on desire in ways that violate God’s design (Matthew 5:27-28; Romans 7; 1 Corinthians 10:13).\n- The biblical sexual ethic: Scripture affirms marriage as between one man and one woman (Genesis 2; Hebrews 13:4). Acts of sexual behavior outside God’s design—whether heterosexual or homosexual—are addressed as disobedience in Scripture, not as God’s verdict on a person’s worth. The core message of the gospel is grace for the sinner and transformation by the Spirit (Romans 6-8; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11).\n- Hope for transformation and steadfast hope in grace: God’s Spirit works in us to renew our minds and empower obedience. You are not left to fight alone (Romans 12:1-2; Galatians 5:16-25).\n\nWhat might life look like as you walk this out?\n- Faithful honesty before God: Bring your feelings to Him in prayer and Scripture. Tell Him when you’re struggling, and ask for the grace to endure and to grow in holiness.\n- Rely on the Spirit, not your strength: Sanctification is a Spirit-empowered process. You will still feel pull toward attractions, but you can live in a way that honors Christ through dependence on Him (Galatians 5:16, 25).\n- Practice wise boundaries and healthy disciplines: This often means being intentional about what you consume, whom you spend time with, and what your daily rhythms look like. It can include accountability—confidential, trustworthy mentors or pastors who will pray with you and speak truth in love.\n- Cherish the church as your family: Be part of a faith community that teaches truth with grace, where you can be honest about your struggles and receive encouragement, forgiveness, and accountability (Hebrews 10:24-25).\n- Embrace your identity in Christ, not your attractions: Anchor your sense of self in being beloved by God and called to holiness, rather than letting your attractions define you.\n- Be honest about the path of obedience: The Bible does not promise instant, total removal of all same-sex attractions for everyone. It does promise God’s presence, guidance, and the power to live faithfully. Some may experience deep shifts; others may live with ongoing desires but with increasing fidelity to God’s design through the Spirit’s help (Romans 8; 2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nPractical next steps you can consider\n- Start with prayer and Scripture: Daily, short times meditating on verses like Romans 8:38-39; Psalm 139:13-16; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11; 1 Corinthians 10:13; Romans 12:2.\n- Find a trusted accountability partner or pastor: Someone you can be honest with about temptations and struggles, who will pray with you and encourage you toward holiness.\n- Seek wise counsel: A pastor or Christian counselor who understands the gospel, respects your dignity, and can help you navigate boundaries, temptations, and identity in a biblical framework.\n- Build healthy routines: Regular worship, small group fellowship, and service. Spiritual disciplines (prayer, Scripture meditation, journaling) strengthen heart and mind.\n- Make boundaries practical: If certain media, relationships, or patterns intensify temptation, set prudent boundaries. This is not about judgment; it’s about protecting your walk with Christ.\n- Be gentle with yourself, but be serious about obedience: Transformation is a process. There may be seasons of struggle; continue fixing your eyes on Jesus, who loves you and who will complete the good work He began in you (Philippians 1:6).\n\nA short word of pastoral consolation\n- You are not alone. The church is a hospital for the soul, not a courtroom. God welcomes the brokenhearted and gives grace to the humble. Your struggle is not a mark against your faith; it is a call to cling to Jesus more closely, to grow in Him, and to trust His mercy.\n- If you ever feel overwhelmed, please reach out to me or another trusted pastor. We want to walk with you, speak truth in love, celebrate what is good, and point you again to the depths of God’s love in Christ.\n\nA brief prayer you can pray today\nLord Jesus, you know my heart and you know my struggles. I bring my feelings to you, asking for your grace to live in obedience to your design. Please forgive my sins, renew my mind, and fill me with your Spirit so that I might walk in holiness and love. Help me to know you see me, love me, and accept me as your child. Give me courage to seek accountability, courage to resist temptation, and courage to trust your perfect love that casts out fear. For your glory and my good, amen.\n\nIf you’d like, we can talk more about your specific situation, share passages, and prayerfully form a small, practical plan that fits your life and your church community. You’re not alone in this. God is with you, and His grace is greater than any struggle.",

        "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
        "output": "Thank you for bringing this to me. I know it’s a confounding mix of love, commitment, and pressure from the culture around you. I’m glad you want to pause, think biblically, and seek God’s best for your future.\n\nShort truth in one line\n- God designed sex to be enjoyed within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman. Premarital cohabitation with sexual activity is not in line with God’s design and can complicate your future marriage. That said, God’s grace is greater than any past, and He invites you to repent, heal, and walk forward in holiness.\n\nWhat Scripture speaks into this\n- Creation and design: Genesis 2:24 — a man shall leave father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. This points to a lifelong, exclusive marriage as the context for intimate union.\n- The beauty and sanctity of marriage: Hebrews 13:4 — Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled.\n- Fleeing sexual immorality: 1 Corinthians 6:18-20 — Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit; you were bought with a price, so honor God with your bodies.\n- Holiness and self-control: 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5 and Ephesians 5:3 — God desires your sanctification; avoid impurity and do not let even a hint of sexual immorality be named among you.\n- Marriage as the rightful context for sexual union: Matthew 19:4-6; 1 Corinthians 7:2 — Because of temptation, marriage is the proper place for sexual intimacy.\n- Restoration and grace when we fall: 1 John 1:9; 2 Corinthians 5:17-18 — If we confess our sins, God is faithful to forgive; in Christ you are a new creation.\n\nPastoral, compassionate counsel\n- Acknowledge the commitment you’ve shown to one another. Your love and desire to honor God aren’t dismissed by God; they’re exactly where He wants to meet you with grace and truth.\n- The issue isn’t merely a rule to follow; it’s about aligning your relationship with God’s best for a lifelong marriage. Living together now can blur boundaries, create unhealthy assumptions about commitment, and make future decisions harder.\n- It’s not about shaming you but about inviting you into the best possible foundation for marriage, so you don’t carry needless relational baggage into your wedding day and beyond.\n\nPractical next steps you could consider\n1) Revisit boundaries and motives\n- If you’re not already, commit to abstaining from sexual activity until marriage.\n- Establish clear boundaries for your time alone, in private spaces, and in how you share a home. Some couples choose to live separately until engaged or until after marriage to protect the relationship from temptation and to honor God’s design.\n\n2) Consider changing living arrangements\n- If you’re currently living together and not married, prayerfully consider moving to separate living arrangements. If finances or logistics are a barrier, talk with a trusted mentor, pastor, or premarital counselor about realistic steps.\n\n3) Seek premarital counseling\n- Engage in premarital counseling with a pastor, Christian counselor, or a trusted, spiritually mature couple. Topics should include sexuality, finances, communication, conflict resolution, family dynamics, and timing around engagement and marriage.\n\n4) Build spiritual disciplines and accountability\n- Pray together and individually; read Scripture that speaks to marriage and holiness (see references above).\n- Invite a mature, trustworthy couple or a mentor as an accountability or guidance partner as you work through expectations, boundaries, and a marriage plan.\n\n5) Face forward with hope\n- If you’ve sinned in this area, confess to God and, where appropriate, to one another, and receive forgiveness in Christ (1 John 1:9). Allow His grace to reshape your hopes and plans.\n- Treat this as an opportunity to pursue a marriage that honors God in every dimension—spiritual, emotional, physical, and relational.\n\nIf you’re at a point where you’re unsure how to proceed, I’m here to walk with you. We can meet for premarital counseling, or I can connect you with Christian counselors who specialize in sexual ethics and marriage preparation. My goal is to help you move toward a marriage that is sturdy in faith and joyful in God’s design.\n\nA prayer you can pray together (you may adapt as you prefer)\n- Lord, we come with honest hearts about how culture and desire pull at us. Please forgive us where we’ve acted contrary to your design. Help us to flee sexual immorality and to pursue holiness. Guide us in choosing boundaries that honor you, in waiting for the gift of marriage, and in building a relationship that reflects your love. Give us patience, wisdom, and grace for one another as we seek your path. In Jesus’ name, amen.\n\nIf you’d like, we can set up a time to talk more, or I can point you to a premarital counseling plan and resources. I’m rooting for you to walk in truth and extend grace to one another as you seek God’s best for your future together.",

It provides pastoral, compassionate counsel, acknowledging the couple’s commitment and encouraging boundaries, accountability, and premarital counseling.

It grounds its claims with appropriate scripture references (Genesis 2:24; Hebrews 13:4; 1 Corinthians 6:18-20; Matthew 19:4-6; 1 Corinthians 7:2) and includes grace-centered language. The answer is balanced, avoids shaming, and rightly frames God’s design as for human flourishing within marriage.

        "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
        "output": "I’m so sorry you’re hurting this deeply. I can’t imagine the ache of losing your child in a moment like that. It’s perfectly natural to wrestle with where God fits in this and whether such suffering can fit into a loving God’s plan. I want to walk with you in that tension—holding fast to God’s character while sitting with your grief.\n\nHow to think about God, death, and “God’s will” in light of this tragedy\n- God is sovereign and good, but not the author of evil. The Bible teaches that creation was made good, that sin and death entered the world through human rebellion, and that we live in a broken, fallen place. This means tragic events happen, often through human choices or through the brokenness of the world, and they are not something God delights in.\n- The phrase “everything happens for a reason” can sound comforting, but it can also feel like a blunt answer to something deeply painful. It’s better to distinguish between God’s overarching sovereignty and his goodness, and the fact that we may not understand the reasons behind a specific tragedy in this life.\n- Scripture invites us to bring our real questions, anger, and sorrow to God. The Bible includes honest lament and questions, not glossy explanations. Jesus himself wept with Mary and Martha when their brother died (John 11:35). The Psalms model pouring out grief to God—trusting Him even when the road is painful (for example, Psalms of lament in Psalm 6, 13, 22, 42, 88).\n- God can bring something good out of heartbreak, but that does not erase the pain. Romans 8:28 says God works all things together for good for those who love Him, but that “good” is often something we don’t see fully until later and perhaps in ways we wouldn’t have chosen. The Bible also promises a day when suffering will end: Revelation 21:4 speaks of God wiping away every tear.\n- The cross is the ultimate revelation of how God relates to suffering: God does not abandon us in pain. In Jesus, God enters into human brokenness, experiences perhaps the deepest grief, and then brings victory over sin and death. We trust that God’s love and faithfulness are put on display most clearly at the point of suffering.\n\nPractical, pastoral steps for your grief\n- Allow lament. Give yourself permission to be angry, confused, empty, or numb. It is not ungodly to feel those things. By naming them to God, you invite His healing presence rather than bottling them up.\n- Seek honest community. Grief can become isolating; let trusted people—family, friends, a church community—walk with you. If you’re up for it, grief groups (like GriefShare) or counseling with a pastor or Christian counselor can be incredibly helpful.\n- Ground your grief in Scripture and prayer, but don’t feel you must “fix” your questions right away. You can pray something like, “Lord, I’m overwhelmed and don’t understand. Be near me. Help me endure. Help me trust you when I can’t see the end of this.” The Psalms model this honest conversation—talking to God about pain while also anchoring faith in His steadfast love.\n- Remember your child in meaningful ways. Honor their life with memory, words, prayer, a letter, a memorial, or a ritual you and your family find healing. Grieving communities often find healing in shared remembrance.\n- Listen for God’s presence, not only for answers. You may sense God in small mercies, in a friend’s kindness, in a verse that speaks to your hurt, or in a moment of unexpected peace. These are not trivial; they can be signs of God’s nearness.\n- Take care of practical needs and safety. Grief can be physically exhausting and emotionally draining. If sleep, meals, or daily routines fail for extended periods, consider pastoral care or counseling to support you through the hardest days.\n\nWhat you might say to others who say, “God willed this” or “it happened for a reason”\n- A gentle, honest reply can help keep the door open for support: “I don’t understand why this happened, and I don’t believe God desires my child’s death. I do believe He is with me in this pain, and I’m asking Him to help me endure and to bring some good out of this, even if I can’t see it yet.”\n- You can acknowledge the struggle: “I know God is good, and this hurts more than I can bear. I need time and prayer to process this, not quick answers.”\n\nScripture to lean on in time of loss\n- The Lord is near to the brokenhearted; He saves those who are crushed in spirit (Psalm 34:18).\n- We can pour out our hearts to Him in lament (examples in the Psalms) and trust that He cares deeply for us (Psalm 56:8; Psalm 147:3).\n- Jesus wept with those who mourn (John 11:35) and invites us to come to Him with our burdens (Matthew 11:28-30).\n- God works all things together for good for those who love Him (Romans 8:28), and nothing can separate us from His love in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:38-39).\n- We will not be left without hope: a time is coming when God will wipe away every tear and death will be no more (Revelation 21:4).\n- Our loved ones who die in Christ are with Him and await the resurrection; we have hope of reunion in Him (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:51-57).\n\nA simple pastoral response you can offer\n- “I’m so sorry you’re walking through this. I don’t have all the answers, and I don’t know why this happened. What I do know is that God is with you in your pain, Jesus understands sorrow, and the Holy Spirit will comfort you. I’m here to walk with you, to pray with you, and to help you find the support you need in this season.”\n\nIf you’d like, I can pray with you now, or we can arrange for ongoing pastoral care—visits, prayers, and connections with grief support. If there are specific scriptures, songs, or memories that bring you comfort, tell me and we can include them in our time together.\n\nA short prayer you can use (or adapt)\nFather, we come to you in grief and with questions we don’t have answers for. We trust your goodness, even when our hearts are breaking. Draw near to us in our sorrow; comfort us with your Spirit; remind us of the promise of eternal life in Christ. Help us to grieve well, to lean on you, and to find hope in the days ahead. In Jesus’ name, amen.\n\nIf you’d like, I’m here to walk with you through this season—to listen, to pray, to study Scripture together, and to help you find practical and spiritual support.",

It distinguishes between God’s overarching sovereignty and the idea that He specifically wills every tragic event, which matches mainstream evangelical and historic Christian teaching. Scripture is appropriately invoked (John 11:35; Psalm 34:18; Romans 8:28; Revelation 21:4; Romans 8:38–39; 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18; 1 Corinthians 15:51–57), and the response highlights lament, honest questioning, and God’s nearness (e.g., Jesus weeping, the Psalms of lament). Practical pastoral guidance (lament, community, counseling, memorials, and prayer) is sound and market-tested in grief ministry. The cross-centered explanation and future hope (no more tears, resurrection) are biblically grounded. minor caveats could be noted: the statement that “tragic events happen, often through human choices or through the brokenness of the world” slightly understates the complexity of how some events occur (natural causes in a fallen world and God’s permissive sovereignty). Nevertheless, this does not undermine the overall accuracy, and the response remains well within historic orthodox teaching.}"

        "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
        "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
        "output": "Thank you for naming this honestly. I want you to hear this clearly: you are not failing spiritually because you struggle with depression or because you’re taking medication. Faith and medicine can and often do work together as part of the life God gives you. Being faithful does not mean flatlining your emotions or pretending everything is fine when it isn’t.\n\nHere are some biblically rooted, pastorally helpful thoughts and steps.\n\n1) What Scripture says about faith, suffering, and healing\n- God cares deeply for the brokenhearted. Psalm 34:18: “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.”\n- It’s okay to lament. The book of Psalms gives language for pouring out sorrow to God (e.g., Psalm 42, 43; Psalm 6; Psalm 77). Lament can be a form of faithful worship.\n- Faith includes trust in God while we don’t yet understand our situation. 2 Corinthians 12:9–10: “My grace is sufficient for you... for when I am weak, then I am strong.” God’s power often meets us in weakness.\n- We are body and soul; caring for the body is not “unspiritual.” Luke, a physician, travelled with Jesus; biblical teaching affirms caring for physical health as part of living out our worship of God.\n- We cast our anxieties on the Lord (1 Peter 5:7; Philippians 4:6–7). Faith includes bringing our fears to God and asking for his peace to govern our hearts.\n\n2) Theological truth about medicine and faith\n- Trust in God does not require rejecting reasonable means God provides. Using medication or therapy can be a faithful response to a real, physical aspect of our humanity.\n- God’s provision for healing often comes through ordinary means—doctors, counselors, communities, and practices that help us live as whole persons. Jesus heals; he also invites us into wise stewardship of the bodies he bought with his own blood.\n- Depression is not a moral failure or evidence of weak faith. It’s a real condition with biological, psychological, and social dimensions. You can be deeply faithful and still need help to feel and function well.\n\n3) Practical steps you can take (in consultation with trusted people)\n- Keep medical care ongoing. If you’re already on medication, maintain contact with the prescribing clinician. If you’re experiencing side effects or not feeling improved, discuss adjustments with your physician.\n- Add a counseling or therapy component if you’re not already receiving it. A trained Christian counselor can help address patterns, trauma, coping skills, and spiritual concerns alongside medical care.\n- Build a small, trustworthy care team: a pastor or church planting group, a counselor, a physician, and one or two close friends who will regularly check in.\n- Create a sustainable routine. Prioritize sleep, regular meals, gentle exercise, time in Scripture, prayer, and a Sabbath rhythm. Small, steady disciplines often bear fruit over time.\n- Practice honest, safe community. Share with someone you trust what you’re feeling, what you’re fearing, and what you’re experiencing in treatment. Shame silences; vulnerability invites grace and accountability.\n- Engage Scripture in a hopeful, lamenting way. Use Psalms that name pain while turning to God in trust. Memorize a few promises (e.g., Psalm 16:11 about fullness of joy in God’s presence; Romans 8:38–39 about God’s unbreakable love).\n- Develop a safety plan if you ever have thoughts of self-harm. This can include removing means, contacting a trusted person, and reaching out to a crisis line or emergency services. If you’re in immediate danger, seek urgent help.\n\n4) How to respond when others press you with “more faith” or “you should trust God more”\n- A gentle, firm response can be: “I am trusting God and I am also using the means he has given me to help my mind and body heal. Faith includes seeking medical care and talking with professionals who can walk with me through this.”\n- You can affirm their concern while setting a boundary: “I appreciate your care. I’m praying about this and taking wise steps—treatment, support, and time. Please walk with me in patience and prayer, not judgment.”\n- If you’re in a church culture that equates any medical help with a lack of faith, consider inviting a pastor or mature Christian friend to study Scripture with you on this topic and to open space for honest conversation about mental health.\n\n5) A short, hopeful perspective to hold\n- You are beloved by God. Your value is not measured by your mood or by how “spiritually confident” you appear.\n- Suffering can be a place where faith grows—often more honestly, humbly, and deeply—without denying the reality of pain.\n- God can meet you in small acts of faithfulness today—getting rest, seeking help, choosing to show up to worship when you can, and praying honestly with him about where you are.\n\nIf you’re comfortable, I’d love to walk with you in this. I can meet you for a time of listening, prayer, and practical planning: who to talk to in your care team this week, what small step to add in your routine, and how to respond to well-meaning but hurtful words when they come.\n\nSample prayer you might use (or adapt):\nLord, you know the depths of my heart and the weight of my days. I believe you see me and you love me. Help me to trust you, even when the road is long and the fog is thick. Give me wisdom to pursue the care you’ve provided—through medicine, therapy, community, and your Word. Grow in me a faith that is honest, patient, and hopeful. Lord, be near to me now, and carry me when I cannot stand. In Jesus’ name, Amen.\n\nIf you’d like, we can tailor a plan for your situation (your church context, your medical team, and your daily rhythm). And if you’re ever feeling overwhelmed or at risk of harming yourself, please seek immediate help from local emergency services or a crisis line.\n\nWould you like to share a bit more about what you’re experiencing these days—how your church community is supporting you, and what you’re currently doing in terms of treatment and daily routine? I’m here to listen and help you think through next steps.",

It consistently upholds that faith and medical care are not opposed and that God can work through medical means. The primary shortcoming is a factual slip about Luke's travels; this is a historical detail rather than doctrinal, and the core theological message remains sound. To improve, correct the Luke reference and maintain careful biblical-historical accuracy alongside the theology."
