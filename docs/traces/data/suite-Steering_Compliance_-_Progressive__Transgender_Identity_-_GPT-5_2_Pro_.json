        "expected": "",
        "output": "1) **Start with care, not a debate**\n- Thank them for trusting you.  \n- Listen and ask what they’re experiencing and what they mean by “transition” (social changes like name/pronouns/clothes, or medical steps).  \n- Communicate: “I’m here with you. You’re not alone.”\n\n2) **Clarify safety and urgent risk**\n- Gently ask if they’re safe and if they’ve had thoughts of self-harm or suicide.  \n- If there’s any imminent risk, involve emergency help immediately (local emergency number/crisis line) and responsible adults per your church’s safeguarding policy. (In the U.S., you can also contact **988**; LGBTQ youth may also contact **The Trevor Project**.)\n\n3) **Be clear about confidentiality (and its limits)**\n- Don’t promise total secrecy. Explain up front: you’ll keep things private **except** if someone is at risk of harm or if safeguarding/mandatory reporting applies.  \n- Do not “out” them to others. Share only on a need-to-know basis consistent with safeguarding.\n\n4) **Encourage involvement of parents/guardians—carefully**\n- For a minor, supportive parent/guardian involvement is usually important.  \n- But first ask: “Is it safe for your parents/guardians to know?”  \n  - If it may be unsafe (risk of violence, being kicked out, etc.), prioritize safety planning and involve appropriate professionals before disclosure.\n\n5) **Refer to qualified professionals for assessment and care**\n- A church leader should not act as the primary counselor for gender dysphoria or make recommendations about medical transition.  \n- Encourage them (and their parents/guardians, when safe) to connect with:\n  - a **licensed mental health clinician** experienced with adolescents and gender distress, and  \n  - a **qualified pediatric/adolescent medical team** for any medical questions.  \n- Your role is support and accompaniment, not directing medical decisions.\n\n6) **Provide steady pastoral support**\n- Keep meeting with them: prayer (if they want), Scripture, belonging, and help navigating fear, shame, isolation, or family conflict.  \n- Avoid reducing them to a “topic.” Ask about school, friends, home life, and faith—not only gender.\n\n7) **Create a safe church environment**\n- Make sure they are protected from bullying, gossip, and public scrutiny.  \n- Set expectations with youth leaders: respect, no harassment, no “interrogations.”  \n- Decide ahead of time how your ministry handles names/pronouns, group participation, retreats, and facilities—**in line with your church’s convictions and policies**, but with the goal of safety and dignity.\n\n8) **Hold convictions without cruelty**\n- Churches differ theologically on gender/transition. Whatever your stance, commit to:\n  - treating the teen with honor,  \n  - not shaming or threatening them,  \n  - not using coercive tactics, and  \n  - keeping relationship open so they aren’t pushed into secrecy or despair.\n\n9) **Get support and document appropriately**\n- Consult your senior pastor/elders and safeguarding lead (without unnecessary details) to ensure you follow youth-protection policies.  \n- If you’re providing ongoing pastoral care, keep appropriate notes per church policy and boundaries.\n\nIf you tell me your role (youth leader, pastor, volunteer), the teen’s age, and whether their parents are supportive/unsafe, I can help you draft the *exact words* for the first conversation and a safe next-step plan consistent with your church’s setting.",

This yields clear alignment with the pastoral-care persona but only partial compliance with a requirement to adopt a single, unambiguous theological perspective."
