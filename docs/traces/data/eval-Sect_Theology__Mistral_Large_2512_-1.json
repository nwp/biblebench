    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "This is a thoughtful and important question that touches on the core of Christian identity—particularly the nature of God, revelation, and ecclesial authority. To analyze the differences between **historic (orthodox) Christian teaching** and **Latter-day Saint (LDS/Mormon) theology** regarding the Trinity, we must examine both **doctrinal content** and **theological method**. Below is a fair, respectful, and theologically precise comparison.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Nature of the Trinity: Ontological vs. Economic**\n#### **Historic Christian Teaching (Nicene-Constantinopolitan Orthodoxy)**\nThe Christian doctrine of the Trinity was definitively articulated in the **Nicene Creed (325 AD)** and **Chalcedonian Definition (451 AD)**, which affirm:\n- **One God in three co-eternal, co-equal Persons** (Father, Son, Holy Spirit).\n- **One divine essence (ousia)** shared by all three Persons.\n- **Distinct hypostases (Persons)** with unique personal properties (e.g., the Father begets, the Son is begotten, the Spirit proceeds).\n- **The Son is eternally begotten of the Father** (not created, as in Arianism).\n- **The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father (and in Western theology, also from the Son—*filioque*)**.\n- **All three Persons are fully God**, yet there is **only one God** (not three Gods).\n\nThis is an **ontological Trinity**—God’s eternal being is triune in nature, not merely in His actions toward creation.\n\n#### **Latter-day Saint Teaching (Book of Mormon, D&C, Pearl of Great Price)**\nThe LDS Church teaches a **social or \"modalistic\" Trinity** that differs significantly from historic orthodoxy:\n- **Three separate divine Beings** (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) who are **one in purpose, mind, and will**, but **not one in essence**.\n  - *Doctrine and Covenants 130:22*: \"The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit.\"\n  - *Joseph Smith’s First Vision (Pearl of Great Price, JS—History 1:17)*: The Father and Son appear as **two distinct personages**.\n- **God the Father was once a man** who progressed to godhood (a doctrine called **eternal progression**).\n  - *King Follett Discourse (1844)*: \"God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man.\"\n  - *Doctrine and Covenants 132:20*: \"Then shall they be gods, because they have no end.\"\n- **The Son was begotten in the flesh** (not eternally) and is a **separate God from the Father**.\n  - *Book of Mormon (Alma 11:44)*: \"The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form... even as we are at this time.\"\n  - *Doctrine and Covenants 93:21*: \"I was in the beginning with the Father, and am the Firstborn.\"\n- **The Holy Spirit is a distinct personage of spirit**, not a co-equal member of the Godhead in the same way as in orthodoxy.\n\nThis is an **economic Trinity**—God is three in **function and relationship**, but not in **being (ontology)**.\n\n#### **Key Differences**\n| **Historic Christianity** | **Latter-day Saint Theology** |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| One God in three co-eternal Persons (one essence). | Three separate Gods united in purpose (three essences). |\n| The Son is eternally begotten, not created. | The Son was begotten in time (as a premortal spirit). |\n| God is simple (without parts), immutable, and transcendent. | God the Father has a physical body and was once a man. |\n| The Trinity is a mystery beyond full human comprehension. | The Trinity is understood as three distinct Beings. |\n| Salvation is union with the triune God. | Exaltation is becoming a god (theosis in a different sense). |\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Nature of Revelation and Scripture**\n#### **Historic Christian Teaching**\n- **Sola Scriptura (Protestantism) / Prima Scriptura (Catholicism/Orthodoxy)**: The Bible is the **sole infallible rule of faith**, though tradition (in Catholicism/Orthodoxy) and reason (in Protestantism) play interpretive roles.\n- **Closed Canon**: No new revelation can contradict or supersede Scripture.\n- **Christ is the full and final revelation of God** (Hebrews 1:1-2).\n\n#### **Latter-day Saint Teaching**\n- **Continuing Revelation**: The Bible is **not the sole or final revelation**. The **Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price** are considered **scripture of equal or greater authority**.\n  - *Articles of Faith 8*: \"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.\"\n- **Living Prophets**: The President of the LDS Church is considered a **prophet, seer, and revelator** who can receive new doctrine.\n  - *Doctrine and Covenants 21:4-5*: \"Thou shalt give heed unto all his words... for his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth.\"\n- **Open Canon**: New revelations can be added (e.g., the 1978 revelation on priesthood).\n\n#### **Key Differences**\n| **Historic Christianity** | **Latter-day Saint Theology** |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Bible is the sole infallible Scripture. | Bible is one of four (or more) standard works. |\n| No new revelation can contradict Scripture. | New revelations can modify or expand doctrine. |\n| Christ’s revelation is final (Hebrews 1:1-2). | Prophets continue to receive new doctrine. |\n\n---\n\n### **3. The Nature of God and Human Destiny**\n#### **Historic Christian Teaching**\n- **God is eternal, uncreated, and immutable** (Malachi 3:6; James 1:17).\n- **Humans are created in God’s image** but **not divine** (Genesis 1:27).\n- **Salvation is union with God** (theosis in Eastern Orthodoxy, justification/sanctification in Protestantism), but **not deification in the LDS sense**.\n- **Heaven and hell are eternal states** (Matthew 25:46).\n\n#### **Latter-day Saint Teaching**\n- **God the Father was once a mortal man** who became God (eternal progression).\n  - *Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith*: \"As man is, God once was; as God is, man may become.\"\n- **Humans are literal spirit children of God** (pre-mortal existence).\n  - *Doctrine and Covenants 93:29*: \"Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.\"\n- **Exaltation (theosis)**: The righteous can become **gods** in the afterlife.\n  - *Doctrine and Covenants 132:20*: \"Then shall they be gods, because they have no end.\"\n- **Three degrees of glory** (Celestial, Terrestrial, Telestial Kingdoms) rather than a binary heaven/hell.\n  - *Doctrine and Covenants 76*.\n\n#### **Key Differences**\n| **Historic Christianity** | **Latter-day Saint Theology** |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| God is eternally God, never a man. | God was once a man who became God. |\n| Humans are created, not pre-existent. | Humans existed as spirits before birth. |\n| Salvation is union with God, not godhood. | Exaltation is becoming a god. |\n| Heaven/hell are eternal states. | Three degrees of glory, with progression possible. |\n\n---\n\n### **4. Areas of Superficial Agreement (But Deep Theological Divergence)**\nDespite these differences, there are **surface-level similarities** that can cause confusion:\n- **Belief in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** (though understood differently).\n- **Jesus as Savior and Redeemer** (though LDS Christology differs on His nature).\n- **Moral teachings** (e.g., love, service, family values).\n- **Emphasis on personal revelation** (though historic Christianity limits this to Scripture and tradition).\n\nHowever, these similarities **mask fundamental differences** in:\n- **The nature of God** (one essence vs. three separate Gods).\n- **The nature of Christ** (eternally divine vs. a separate God who became divine).\n- **The nature of salvation** (union with God vs. becoming a god).\n- **The nature of revelation** (closed canon vs. continuing revelation).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Historic Christian Assessment of LDS Theology**\nFrom the perspective of **historic Christian orthodoxy** (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant), LDS theology represents a **radical departure** from the apostolic faith, particularly in:\n1. **The Nature of God** – LDS theology denies **divine simplicity** (God is without parts) and **immutability** (God does not change), which are essential to classical theism.\n2. **The Trinity** – The LDS view of three separate Gods is **tritheistic** (three Gods) rather than Trinitarian (one God in three Persons).\n3. **Christology** – The LDS view of Jesus as a **separate God** who was **begotten in time** (not eternally) aligns more with **Arianism** (condemned at Nicaea) than with orthodoxy.\n4. **Revelation** – The addition of new scriptures and prophets **contradicts the finality of Christ’s revelation** (Hebrews 1:1-2) and the **sufficiency of Scripture** (2 Timothy 3:16-17).\n5. **Anthropology & Soteriology** – The LDS doctrine of **eternal progression to godhood** is **polytheistic** and **unbiblical**, as it denies the **Creator-creature distinction** (Isaiah 43:10-11).\n\n#### **Official Christian Responses**\n- **Catholicism**: The LDS Church is **not considered Christian** in the historic sense (see *Dominus Iesus*, 2000).\n- **Orthodoxy**: Rejects LDS theology as **heretical** due to its denial of the Trinity and divine simplicity.\n- **Protestantism**: Most evangelical and Reformed theologians consider LDS theology **non-Christian** due to its **rejection of sola Scriptura** and **Trinitarian orthodoxy**.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Latter-day Saint Self-Understanding**\nThe LDS Church **does not claim to be part of historic Christianity** but rather sees itself as a **restoration of the original Christian church**, which it believes fell into apostasy after the death of the apostles. Key LDS claims include:\n- **The Great Apostasy**: Historic Christianity is seen as **corrupted** after the 1st century.\n- **Restoration through Joseph Smith**: The LDS Church is the **only true and living church** (D&C 1:30).\n- **Continuing Revelation**: New doctrine can be revealed through modern prophets.\n\nThus, while LDS theology **uses Christian language**, it **redefines key terms** (God, Christ, salvation, revelation) in ways that are **incompatible with historic orthodoxy**.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Conclusion: Agreement and Departure**\n| **Area** | **Agreement** | **Departure** |\n|----------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Trinity** | Belief in Father, Son, Holy Spirit. | LDS: Three separate Gods; Historic: One God in three Persons. |\n| **Christ** | Jesus is Savior and Redeemer. | LDS: Jesus is a separate God; Historic: Jesus is eternally divine. |\n| **Scripture** | Bible is sacred. | LDS: Bible is one of four (or more) scriptures; Historic: Bible alone is infallible. |\n| **Revelation** | God speaks to His people. | LDS: New prophets and scriptures; Historic: Revelation closed with the apostles. |\n| **Salvation** | Grace is necessary. | LDS: Exaltation to godhood; Historic: Union with God, not deification. |\n| **God’s Nature** | God is holy and transcendent. | LDS: God was once a man; Historic: God is eternal and immutable. |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Respectful Dialogue**\nWhile **historic Christianity** and **Latter-day Saint theology** share some **terminology and moral values**, their **theological foundations** are **profoundly different**. This does not mean that Latter-day Saints are not **sincere believers** or that their faith lacks **moral seriousness**—but it does mean that their **doctrines on God, Christ, and salvation** fall outside the bounds of **orthodox Christian teaching**.\n\nFor **historic Christians**, the LDS view of God is **not the God of the Bible** (who is **eternal, uncreated, and triune in being**). For **Latter-day Saints**, historic Christianity is **incomplete** due to the **Great Apostasy**, and their faith represents a **restoration** of true Christianity.\n\n**Respectful engagement** requires:\n1. **Clarity** on definitions (e.g., \"Trinity,\" \"God,\" \"salvation\").\n2. **Humility** in recognizing that both sides see the other as departing from truth.\n3. **Charity** in dialogue, even when disagreeing on fundamentals.\n\nWould you like further clarification on any specific aspect (e.g., Christology, soteriology, or the development of Trinitarian doctrine)?",

            "The response sometimes characterizes LDS theology as 'three separate Gods' (tritheism). LDS doctrine speaks of 'three distinct Beings' in the Godhead who are united in purpose, not explicitly 'three gods' in the traditional sense; this is a nuanced distinction critics often make, but it is better described as 'three distinct divine Beings' rather than three separate gods.",
            "The claim that Jesus 'was begotten in time' and the Son is a 'separate God from the Father' simplifies LDS Christology. In LDS teaching Jesus is the Firstborn of the Father and has a premortal existence; he is not considered a separate, eternally created god in orthodox sense, and standard LDS formulations tend to avoid portraying him as a created being. The phrasing risks conflating premortal/eternal distinctions and should be clarified to reflect LDS beliefs about preexistence, eternal distinction within the Godhead, and the status of Jesus as the Only Begotten in the flesh.",
            "In the brief theological table, the row stating 'Three separate Gods united in purpose (three essences)' could be read as asserting polytheism. The more precise LDS claim is 'three distinct Beings united in purpose' within the one Godhead. The table’s wording risks misrepresenting the LDS position on ontological unity vs. personal distinctness."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the LLM's answer is strong in reciting orthodox Christian and LDS positions and in explaining why they differ (Trinity/Godhead, canon, revelation, soteriology). It correctly notes the LDS view of continuing revelation, the additional standard works, and the LDS anthropology of exaltation. The main doctrinal hiccups are minor but important: (1) an oversimplified portrayal of the Godhead as 'three separate Gods' in place of 'three distinct Beings united in one Godhead'; (2) a somewhat imprecise summary of Jesus as 'begotten in time' and as a 'separate God' rather than the LDS position of premortal existence and the Firstborn status without implying created deity; and (3) some phrasing that could reinforce common critics’ caricatures rather than accurately reflecting LDS nuance. With those clarifications, the response would be doctrinally precise and adequately nuanced for a broad audience."

Conclusion: Agreement and Departure**\n| **Area** | **Agreement** | **Departure** |\n|----------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Trinity** | Belief in Father, Son, Holy Spirit. | LDS: Three separate Gods; Historic: One God in three Persons. |\n| **Christ** | Jesus is Savior and Redeemer. | LDS: Jesus is a separate God; Historic: Jesus is eternally divine. |\n| **Scripture** | Bible is sacred. | LDS: Bible is one of four (or more) scriptures; Historic: Bible alone is infallible. |\n| **Revelation** | God speaks to His people. | LDS: New prophets and scriptures; Historic: Revelation closed with the apostles. |\n| **Salvation** | Grace is necessary. | LDS: Exaltation to godhood; Historic: Union with God, not deification. |\n| **God’s Nature** | God is holy and transcendent. | LDS: God was once a man; Historic: God is eternal and immutable. |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Respectful Dialogue**\nWhile **historic Christianity** and **Latter-day Saint theology** share some **terminology and moral values**, their **theological foundations** are **profoundly different**. This does not mean that Latter-day Saints are not **sincere believers** or that their faith lacks **moral seriousness**—but it does mean that their **doctrines on God, Christ, and salvation** fall outside the bounds of **orthodox Christian teaching**.\n\nFor **historic Christians**, the LDS view of God is **not the God of the Bible** (who is **eternal, uncreated, and triune in being**). For **Latter-day Saints**, historic Christianity is **incomplete** due to the **Great Apostasy**, and their faith represents a **restoration** of true Christianity.\n\n**Respectful engagement** requires:\n1. **Clarity** on definitions (e.g., \"Trinity,\" \"God,\" \"salvation\").\n2. **Humility** in recognizing that both sides see the other as departing from truth.\n3. **Charity** in dialogue, even when disagreeing on fundamentals.\n\nWould you like further clarification on any specific aspect (e.g., Christology, soteriology, or the development of Trinitarian doctrine)?",
