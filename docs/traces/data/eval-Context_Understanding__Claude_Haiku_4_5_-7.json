            "Overstates the notion of 'concealing' truth as an intentional tactic in all cases. Scripture speaks of revealing mysteries to the receptive and judgment/seeing/hearing blindness to the hard-hearted, but the dynamic is more complex than a simple concealment principle (see Matthew 13:10-17; 13:11-15).",
            "The phrase 'Bypass intellectual defenses' is a provocative characterization. Parables function as a teaching method that challenges listeners’ assumptions and exposes hearts; describing this as 'bypassing defenses' can read as manipulative rather than pedagogical or revelatory, and should be framed as the listeners' reception/response determining whether truth is understood.",
            "While the reference to Psalm 78:2 via Matthew 13:35 is accurate, the claim that parables were part of a singular 'planned teaching method' should be nuanced: Scripture presents parables as a fulfillment of prophecy and a divine method for revealing truth to some while testing/responding to others, rather than a blanket statement about 'plan' as such."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer largely tracks biblical teaching: parables reveal truth to those with receptive hearts and reveal or condemn the hard-hearted; they use familiar imagery to make complex truths memorable; they provoke reflection; Matthew 13:35 (citing Psalm 78:2) is rightly invoked to support the view that Jesus spoke in parables as part of prophetic fulfillment. The response also notes that Jesus and His disciples explain the meaning privately (implied by the reference to Matthew 13:10-17 and related passages), which captures an important nuance. However, there are some caveats and nuances that would strengthen accuracy:\n- The description of parables as ‘concealing truth from those unwilling to understand’ is biblically valid but should be carefully nuanced to acknowledge the complexity: concealment is tied to hardness of heart and the listener’s response, not a unilateral tactic by Jesus in every instance.\n- The term ‘bypass intellectual defenses’ risks implying manipulation; a more precise framing is that parables reveal truth in a way that requires discernment and exposes listeners’ hearts, which can lead to judgment for the unrepentant.\n- A fuller treatment would note the role of the Holy Spirit in understanding (for example, Luke 8:10; Mark 4:11-12) and the private explanations to the disciples (e.g., Matthew 13:36-43) as essential aspects of how parables function in teaching and interpretation.\nOverall, the answer is solid and doctrinally sound, with minor over-simplifications that could be tempered for greater precision."
