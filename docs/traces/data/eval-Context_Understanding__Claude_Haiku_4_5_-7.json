    "output": "# Why Jesus Used Parables\n\nJesus employed parables as a deliberate teaching strategy for several interconnected reasons:\n\n## Primary Purposes\n\n**1. Making spiritual truth accessible**\nParables used familiar, everyday situations—farming, fishing, family relations, commerce—to convey abstract spiritual principles. This made profound teachings comprehensible to diverse audiences with varying education levels.\n\n**2. Engaging the imagination**\nStories are inherently memorable. A parable about a prodigal son or a sower creates mental images that stick with listeners better than abstract doctrine alone.\n\n**3. Inviting reflection**\nParables don't spell everything out. They require interpretation, prompting listeners to think deeply and discover meanings themselves—creating more meaningful learning than passive reception.\n\n## Secondary Functions\n\n**4. Concealment and revelation**\nAccording to Matthew 13:10-15 and parallel accounts, Jesus suggests parables both reveal truth to receptive listeners and conceal it from those unwilling to understand. This reflects the selective nature of spiritual insight.\n\n**5. Avoiding direct confrontation**\nParables allowed Jesus to address sensitive topics—royal authority, wealth, religious hypocrisy—through narrative distance, reducing immediate resistance while still challenging listeners.\n\n## Historical Context\n\nThis teaching method wasn't unique to Jesus. Jewish rabbinical tradition used parables (*mashalim*), though Jesus's parables are notably sophisticated and central to his entire teaching corpus.\n\nThe Gospels present parables as Jesus's predominant teaching mode, suggesting he viewed this method as essential to his mission.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns well with mainstream biblical-historical understanding. It correctly identifies primary motives (making spiritual truth accessible, engaging imagination, inviting reflection) and a key secondary motive (concealment/revelation) with support from Matthew 13:10–15 and parallel texts. It also notes historical context, including the rabbinic use of parables (mashalim), and acknowledges that parables address sensitive topics in a way that can reduce direct confrontation. Examples (Sower, Prodigal Son) and the emphasis on memorability are appropriate. The claim that parables were the predominant teaching mode is arguable but defensible given their prominence in the Gospels; this is the main area where nuance could be added. Overall, the answer is factually accurate, comprehensive enough for the question, and appropriately nuanced."
