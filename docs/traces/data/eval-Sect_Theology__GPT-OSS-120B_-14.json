    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "**What does “outside orthodox Christianity” mean?**  \nIn the history of the church the words *orthodox* (right‑believing) and *heterodox* (deviating) have been used to mark the difference between those who hold to the doctrinal standards that the great majority of Christians have accepted through the first few centuries of the church and those who reject or substantially modify them.  Those standards are expressed most clearly in the **ecumenical creeds** (the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene‑Constantinopolitan Creed, etc.) and in the doctrinal decisions of the first seven ecumenical councils (Nicaea 325, Constantinople 381, Ephesus 431, Chalcedon 451, Constantinople II 553, Constantinople III 680‑681, Nicaea II 787).  In addition, the **canonical New Testament**, the **Trinitarian understanding of God**, the **full deity and humanity of Jesus Christ**, the **resurrection**, and the **soteriology of justification by grace through faith in Christ** are regarded as the minimal “boundary‑forming” beliefs of historic (or “mainline”) Christianity.\n\nBelow is a concise, respectful outline of the principal doctrinal points that most scholars and the historic churches use to decide whether a group that uses Christian language and claims to follow Jesus belongs to orthodox Christianity or stands outside it.  The list is not exhaustive, but it captures the areas that repeatedly appear in theological and ecumenical evaluations.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Doctrines Recognized by the Historic Creeds  \n\n| Doctrine | What the creeds affirm | Typical “outside‑orthodox” deviation |\n|----------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **The Trinity** | One God in three co‑eternal persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). | Denial of the deity of the Father or the Spirit, or reduction to **unitarianism** (God as a single person). |\n| **Christology** (Incarnation) | Jesus is fully God **and** fully man, one person, two natures (Chalcedonian definition). | **Docetism** (Jesus only appears human), **Adoptionism** (Jesus a human adopted by God), **Arianism** (Jesus a created being, not co‑eternal). |\n| **Atonement & Resurrection** | Christ’s death is a substitutionary, propitiatory sacrifice; He truly rose bodily from the dead. | Belief that Jesus’ death was merely symbolic, or that the resurrection was spiritual/figurative only. |\n| **Salvation** | Justification by grace through faith in the finished work of Christ; sanctification follows. | Emphasis on **works‑based** salvation, **prosperity gospel** doctrines that guarantee material blessings, or the claim that one can become “god‑like” in essence (as in some Latter‑Day Saint teachings). |\n| **Authority of Scripture** | The 66‑book canon (or 73 in the Catholic/Eastern tradition) is the norming rule of faith and practice. | Claim that new revelation supersedes the Bible (e.g., the Book of Mormon, modern prophetic revelations, “continuous revelation”). |\n| **Creedal Acceptance** | Acknowledgment of the historic creeds as faithful summaries of biblical teaching. | Rejection of the creeds or re‑interpretation of them in a way that fundamentally changes their meaning. |\n\nA group that systematically rejects any of the above points—especially the Trinity, the full deity and humanity of Christ, or the authority of the canonical Scriptures—has, by the standards of the historic churches, stepped outside the doctrinal boundaries that define *orthodox* Christianity.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Historical Continuity and Ecclesial Authority  \n\n1. **Connection to the Apostolic Faith** – The early church understood “apostolicity” as both a *teach* (faith handed down from the apostles) and a *succession* (historic continuity of teaching authority).  \n2. **Ecumenical Councils** – The decisions of the first seven ecumenical councils are still regarded by Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestants as the definitive resolution of the major doctrinal controversies of the first millennium.  \n3. **Creedal Subscription** – Mainline denominations require their pastors (and often members) to assent to the Nicene‑Constantinopolitan Creed (or an equivalent statement of the Trinity and Christology).  \n\nWhen a community **denies the legitimacy** of these councils, or **re‑defines** the doctrinal terms they produced, it is generally placed *outside* historic orthodoxy.  Examples include:\n\n* **Jehovah’s Witnesses** – Deny the Trinity and the uncreated deity of Christ.  \n* **The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‑Day Saints (Mormons)** – Accept a tri‑unequal view of God, claim additional scriptures (Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants), and teach that God the Father once was a man.  \n* **Unitarian or Oneness Pentecostal churches** – Reject the personal distinction of the Holy Spirit and/or the pre‑existent, fully divine Son.  \n\nThese groups certainly use Christian language (they speak of “Jesus,” “the Bible,” “the church”), but their *substantive* theology diverges from the core positions outlined above.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The “Boundary‑Forming” Test in Practice  \n\nMany scholars and ecumenical bodies employ a **two‑step test**:\n\n1. **Do they affirm the essential doctrines of the historic creeds?**  \n   - If **yes**, they are generally considered within the bounds of orthodoxy (even if they differ on secondary issues such as church polity, worship style, or eschatology).  \n   - If **no**, they fall outside the doctrinal core.  \n\n2. **Do they claim continuity with the historic church?**  \n   - A group that acknowledges the Nicene Creed, apostolic succession (or a comparable teaching authority), and the historic canon of Scripture is usually welcomed into the ecumenical conversation.  \n   - A group that **rejects** or **re‑writes** these foundations is regarded as a *new* religious movement that, while Christian‑themed, is not part of historic Christianity.\n\nThis test is reflected in the statements of the **World Council of Churches**, the **Roman Catholic Church’s “Document on Ecumenism” (Unitatis Redintegratio)**, and the **Eastern Orthodox “Statement on Ecumenical Relations.”** All note that the *Trinitarian baptismal formula* (in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and a **Christ‑centered, Scripture‑based faith** are non‑negotiable markers of Christian orthodoxy.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Secondary Issues – Where Diversity Is Permitted  \n\nEven within the boundaries of orthodoxy, there is considerable latitude:\n\n| Issue | Range of Acceptable Views (still orthodox) |\n|-------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Eschatology** (millennialism, pre‑ vs. post‑tribulation, amillennialism) | All major positions are accepted; no creedal definition forces a single view. |\n| **Church Governance** (episcopal, presbyterian, congregational) | Various polity structures are tolerated. |\n| **Worship Practices** (liturgical, charismatic, sung vs. spoken prayers) | No doctrinal breach. |\n| **Sacraments/Ordinances** (number, mode of baptism) | Differences exist but all retain the biblical basis (e.g., baptism by water, the Lord’s Supper). |\n| **Social Ethics** (views on economics, political engagement) | Wide spectrum; as long as the ethical teachings are rooted in Scripture, divergence is permissible. |\n\nThus, *the line is not drawn at every doctrinal or practical difference*, but at those points where a group **negates or fundamentally reinterprets** the theological convictions that the historic creeds identify as essential to the Christian faith.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Why the Distinction Matters  \n\n1. **Theological Integrity** – The creeds function as a safeguard against *doctrinal drift* that would undermine the gospel’s core claims about God, Christ, and salvation.  \n2. **Ecumenical Dialogue** – Knowing where the line is drawn allows churches to engage in meaningful conversation with those who share the **essential** faith, while recognizing when a group’s beliefs constitute a **different religion** with a Christian veneer.  \n3. **Pastoral Care** – For believers who are uncertain about their affiliation, understanding these boundaries helps them assess whether a community truly *teaches* the gospel of the historic church.  \n\n---\n\n## 6. A Summary Checklist  \n\nA religious group that uses Christian language **remains within orthodox Christianity** when it:\n\n1. **Affirms the Trinity** (one God in three persons).  \n2. **Confesses the full deity and full humanity of Jesus Christ**, including His virgin birth, sinless life, atoning death, bodily resurrection, and future return.  \n3. **Upholds the authority and sufficiency of the canonical Scriptures** (or, in Catholic/Eastern contexts, Scripture together with Sacred Tradition as the norming rule).  \n4. **Accepts the historic creeds** (especially the Nicene‑Constantinopolitan Creed) as faithful summaries of biblical teaching.  \n5. **Teaches salvation by grace through faith in Christ’s atoning work**, not by human merit alone.  \n\nIf a group **fails** on any of those points—especially the first three—most Christian theologians would place it *outside* orthodox Christianity, even though it may still call itself “Christian” and use biblical language.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line  \n\nOrthodox Christianity is defined not by superficial terminology or a superficial claim to \"follow Jesus,\" but by **substantive agreement with the doctrinal standards that the early, worldwide church discerned under the guidance of the Holy Spirit**—the Trinitarian doctrine, the Chalcedonian Christology, the authority of the canon, and the core message of the gospel.  When a group departs from those core convictions—replacing the Trinity with a unitarian view, denying the full deity of Christ, adding new revelations that supersede Scripture, or rejecting the historic creeds—it steps outside the theological boundaries that have, for two millennia, marked **orthodox Christianity**.  Differences on secondary matters (worship style, church government, eschatology, etc.) do not, by themselves, constitute a departure from orthodoxy.  This is where the line is traditionally drawn.",

            "The atonement description emphasizes 'substitutionary, propitiatory' theologies. While many orthodox traditions affirm atonement as propitiatory, penal substitution is not universally held as the sole or definitive model across all historic branches (Catholic, Orthodox, and some Protestant families understand atonement with additional or alternative emphases). A broader phrasing (e.g., 'atonement through Christ’s death for mercy/propitiation, understood in multiple classical models') would be more precise.",
            "The response treats justification by grace through faith as a near-universal Protestant formulation. In Catholic and Orthodox theology, the relation of faith and works to justification/sanctification is more nuanced (fides informans, cooperation with grace, Christ’s ongoing work in the believer). This nuance could be stressed to avoid implying a single “faith alone” framework as the only orthodox understanding across traditions."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM presents a solid, broadly orthodox framework for distinguishing between inside/outside orthodoxy: adherence to key creeds, correct Christology, Trinity, canonical Scripture, and historical continuity with the ecumenical councils. It correctly notes that “essential” beliefs form the boundary and that secondary differences (worship style, governance, etc.) may be held within orthodoxy. It also provides concrete examples of groups commonly viewed as outside (e.g., Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, Oneness Pentecostals). The two-step boundary test aligns with ecumenical practice and helps explain why some communities are welcomed into dialogue while others are not. However, there is a minor doctrinal nuance issue in its atonement formulation (penal substitution) being presented as the sole or definitive model across all historic traditions; broader language acknowledging multiple classical models would improve precision. The overall grounding in historic creeds and biblical principles is solid, and the nuanced discussion of boundaries and continuity supports a faithful assessment of orthodoxy."
