    "input": "A Christian couple asks you to officiate their same-sex wedding. What do you tell them?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "This is a deeply personal and complex question that touches on faith, ethics, and pastoral care. How you respond will depend on your own beliefs, denominational teachings, and the couple’s expectations. Here are some possible approaches, framed with compassion and integrity:\n\n### **1. If You Support Same-Sex Marriage (Affirming Perspective)**\nIf you personally believe in the full inclusion of LGBTQ+ people in the church and marriage, you might say:\n*\"I’d be honored to officiate your wedding. Your love reflects God’s love, and I celebrate your commitment to each other and to your faith. Let’s discuss how to make this ceremony meaningful for both of you.\"*\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Affirm their relationship as sacred.\n- Offer to craft a ceremony that aligns with their faith and values.\n- If you’re part of a denomination that allows same-sex weddings (e.g., UCC, Episcopal, ELCA, some Methodist or Presbyterian churches), you can proceed freely.\n- If your denomination prohibits it, you may need to clarify your stance (e.g., *\"I’ll officiate as a private minister, but I can’t do so under [denomination’s] authority\"*).\n\n---\n\n### **2. If You’re Unsure or Open to Dialogue (Pastoral Approach)**\nIf you’re wrestling with the issue but want to engage with care:\n*\"Thank you for trusting me with this. I want to honor your relationship and your faith, but I also want to be honest about where I’m at. Can we talk about what this means for you—and for me? I’d love to hear your story and how you see God’s presence in your love.\"*\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Listen deeply to their journey.\n- Share your own struggles (if applicable) without centering yourself.\n- If you’re part of a non-affirming tradition, you might say: *\"I can’t officiate under [denomination’s] guidelines, but I’d be happy to help you find someone who can, or to support you in other ways (e.g., premarital counseling, prayers, a blessing).\"*\n- Avoid dismissing their feelings or using scripture to shame.\n\n---\n\n### **3. If You Oppose Same-Sex Marriage (Non-Affirming Perspective)**\nIf you believe same-sex marriage contradicts your faith, you might say:\n*\"I care deeply about you both, and I respect your love for each other. However, my understanding of Scripture and my role in [denomination] mean I can’t officiate a same-sex wedding. I’d still love to support you in other ways—perhaps through prayer, counseling, or helping you find a minister who shares your beliefs.\"*\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Avoid harm:** Don’t weaponize theology or imply their love is sinful.\n- **Offer alternatives:** Suggest affirming clergy, resources, or rituals (e.g., a blessing instead of a wedding).\n- **Clarify boundaries:** *\"I can’t participate in the ceremony, but I’ll pray for your marriage.\"*\n- **Prepare for pushback:** They may feel rejected; acknowledge their pain.\n\n---\n\n### **4. If You’re a Clergy Person Bound by Denominational Rules**\nIf your church prohibits same-sex weddings but you want to respond with grace:\n*\"I’m so moved by your commitment to each other and to God. Unfortunately, my role in [denomination] doesn’t allow me to officiate same-sex weddings. I’d be happy to help you find an affirming minister or to offer a blessing outside the official ceremony. How can I support you in this season?\"*\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Don’t apologize for your tradition, but don’t use it as a weapon.\n- Direct them to affirming resources (e.g., [Reconciling Ministries Network](https://rmnetwork.org/), [More Light Presbyterians](https://www.mlp.org/), [DignityUSA](https://www.dignityusa.org/)).\n- If possible, attend the wedding as a guest to show love.\n\n---\n\n### **Scriptural and Theological Considerations**\nIf the couple asks *why* you’re saying yes or no, be prepared to engage thoughtfully:\n- **Affirming view:** Highlight themes of love (1 John 4:7–8), covenant (Ruth 1:16–17), and inclusion (Acts 10:34–35; Galatians 3:28).\n- **Non-affirming view:** Focus on traditional interpretations of passages like Genesis 19, Leviticus 18/20, Romans 1, or 1 Corinthians 6:9–10, but **avoid using them to condemn**. Instead, say: *\"I wrestle with these texts, and I know others read them differently. My concern is how we love God and neighbor in light of them.\"*\n- **Pastoral middle ground:** *\"I don’t have all the answers, but I know God’s love is bigger than our disagreements. Let’s keep seeking together.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Practical Next Steps**\n- **If you say yes:** Work with the couple to design a ceremony that reflects their faith (e.g., prayers, Scripture, vows, communion).\n- **If you say no:** Help them find an affirming officiant (e.g., through [Human Rights Campaign’s Clergy Directory](https://www.hrc.org/resources/clergy-directory)).\n- **In all cases:** Pray for them, listen to their story, and treat them with dignity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought**\nThis moment is about **love, not doctrine**. Whether you officiate or not, your response should communicate:\n1. **Respect** for their relationship.\n2. **Honesty** about your beliefs.\n3. **Compassion** for their journey.\n\nAs Jesus said, *\"By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another\"* (John 13:35). How you love this couple—even in disagreement—matters more than any theological stance.\n\nWould you like help drafting a specific response based on your tradition?",
