        "expected": "",
        "output": "The question of whether unbelievers will experience eternal conscious torment is one of the most debated and significant topics in Christian theology. There is no single, universally accepted answer, as different Christian traditions interpret the biblical text differently.\n\nGenerally, there are three primary theological views on the fate of the wicked:\n\n### 1. Eternal Conscious Torment (Traditionalism)\nThis is the historically dominant view held by most Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and many Protestant traditions (such as Reformed and Baptist).\n\n*   **The Belief:** Those who reject God will suffer in hell forever. The punishment is both conscious and unending.\n*   **Biblical Support:** Proponents point to passages where Jesus describes hell as a place of \"eternal fire\" (Matthew 25:41) and \"eternal punishment\" (Matthew 25:46). They also cite Revelation 14:11, which describes the smoke of their torment rising \"forever and ever,\" and Revelation 20:10, which speaks of being tormented \"day and night forever and ever.\"\n*   **Theological Logic:** This view argues that because God is infinite and eternal, sin against an infinite God warrants infinite punishment. Furthermore, it is argued that human souls are created immortal by God; therefore, they cannot simply cease to exist.\n\n### 2. Annihilationism (Conditional Immortality)\nThis view is held by various Protestant denominations, including Seventh-day Adventists, some Anglicans, and a growing number of Evangelicals (such as John Stott and Edward Fudge).\n\n*   **The Belief:** The wicked will be resurrected, judged, punished in proportion to their sins, and then ultimately destroyed or cease to exist. Hell is a place of permanent destruction rather than permanent conscious torment.\n*   **Biblical Support:** Proponents emphasize scriptures that speak of the wicked \"perishing\" (John 3:16), being \"destroyed\" (Matthew 10:28), and suffering \"the second death\" (Revelation 20:14). They interpret \"eternal punishment\" (Matthew 25:46) as a punishment that is eternal in its *consequences* (it is irreversible) rather than in its *duration*.\n*   **Theological Logic:** This view suggests that immortality is a gift given by God to the righteous through Jesus, not an inherent quality of all human souls. Therefore, God does not torment the wicked indefinitely but allows them to die the \"second death,\" which is the extinction of their being.\n\n### 3. Christian Universalism\nThis is a minority view, though it has historical roots in the early church and has seen a resurgence in modern times.\n\n*   **The Belief:** Ultimately, all human beings will be reconciled to God through Christ. While God may punish sinners for a time to refine them or bring them to repentance, no one will remain in hell forever.\n*   **Biblical Support:** Proponents point to passages such as 1 Corinthians 15:22 (\"in Christ all will be made alive\"), Colossians 1:20 (reconciling \"all things\" to himself), and 1 Timothy 2:4 (God \"desires all people to be saved\").\n*   **Theological Logic:** This view emphasizes God’s love and sovereignty as stronger than human sin. It posits that God’s victory over evil must be total and that eternal torment would imply a failure of God's plan to redeem creation.\n\n### Summary\nThe answer to your question depends entirely on which theological framework you find most convincing:\n\n*   **If you hold to Traditionalism:** Yes, unbelievers will experience eternal conscious torment.\n*   **If you hold to Annihilationism:** No, they will ultimately be destroyed and cease to exist.\n*   **If you hold to Universalism:** No, they will eventually be reconciled to God.",
