            "The statement that Chronicles 'often reproduces passages verbatim' from Samuel-Kings is overstated. The Chronicler relies on Samuel-Kings as a primary source and reworks, reorganizes, and adds material, but verbatim copying is not generally the norm."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is largely accurate: Kings and Chronicles cover the same broad historical period but from different perspectives (Kings with a prophetic/covenant lens across both Israel and Judah; Chronicles with a priestly emphasis on Judah, Davidic line, and temple). It correctly notes post-exilic composition for Chronicles and a likely exilic composition window for Kings, as well as Chronicles’ reliance on earlier sources, including Samuel-Kings, and its selective omission of unfavorable material about David/Solomon alongside additions about temple worship. A minor point of nuance is that Chronicles does not typically reproduce passages verbatim from Samuel-Kings; it reuses material with editorial shaping. The answer is otherwise aligned with scholarly consensus and directly addresses the question."
