This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6).

    "output": "# Theological Analysis: LDS Teaching on Human Deification\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe statement \"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become\" represents a foundational teaching of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), commonly known as Mormonism. This analysis will examine this teaching within its LDS theological context and evaluate its consistency with historic orthodox Christian doctrine. The goal is to provide an accurate, fair, and respectful comparison that identifies both areas of departure and any points of genuine convergence.\n\n## The LDS Teaching in Context\n\nThis statement originates from Joseph Smith, the founder of the LDS Church, and appears in the \"Lectures on Faith\" (Lecture 5, section 7), which was historically included in the LDS standard works. The teaching expresses what LDS theology calls the doctrine of \"eternal progression\" or \"exaltation.\" According to this framework, God the Father was not always divine but progressed from a mortal state to achieve godhood through faithful obedience and proper choices. Furthermore, human beings who live righteously, receive necessary ordinances, and continue in faith may likewise progress to become gods themselves, inheriting the fullness of the Father's glory and continuing their eternal progression.\n\nThis doctrine is interconnected with other distinctive LDS teachings. The LDS Church teaches that the universe contains many gods, that Jesus Christ and God the Father are separate physical beings, and that humans are literally spirit children of God the Father who were born in mortality to gain physical bodies and prove their worthiness. The ultimate goal of mortal existence is to attain \"exaltation,\" which includes the continuation of the family unit and the potential to become like God.\n\n## Departure from Orthodox Christian Theology\n\nThis LDS teaching departs significantly from historic orthodox Christian theology in several fundamental ways that go beyond mere semantic differences or secondary matters.\n\n### The Nature and Eternality of God\n\nThe most foundational departure concerns the very nature of God. Orthodox Christian theology, across its major traditions—Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant—affirms what is called classical theism. This understanding holds that God is absolutely transcendent, uncreated, and eternal in His divine nature. The biblical witness, particularly in passages like Psalm 90:2 (\"Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God\") and Isaiah 43:10 (\"Before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me\"), establishes that the God of Israel has no beginning and exists independently of all creation.\n\nThe LDS conception that God the Father was once a mortal being who achieved divinity represents a fundamental redefinition of the divine. In orthodox theology, God's divine nature—the attribute of being God—cannot be acquired; it is essential to who God is eternally. To say that God \"once was\" something other than God implies that divinity is a status to be achieved rather than an eternal essence. This undermines the biblical witness to God's absolute sovereignty and self-existence, which forms the foundation for human trust and worship.\n\nFurthermore, orthodox theology maintains that there is only one God in essence or being (though three in persons within the Trinity). The LDS view of multiple gods who were once mortal represents a polytheistic framework that contradicts the monotheistic testimony of Scripture and the historic creeds. While Orthodox Christianity affirms the Trinity, this is understood as three distinct persons sharing one divine nature, not three separate beings who each attained divinity independently.\n\n### The Impossibility of Human Deification in the Orthodox Sense\n\nThe second half of the statement—\"as God now is, man may become\"—also diverges sharply from orthodox Christian teaching, though this requires careful qualification because the relationship is more nuanced than outright rejection.\n\nOrthodox Christianity does affirm what Eastern Orthodox theology calls *theosis* (deification), a term found in Scripture itself, particularly in 2 Peter 1:4, which speaks of believers becoming \"partakers of the divine nature.\" The Church Fathers developed this doctrine extensively, teaching that through union with Christ and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, believers are transformed to reflect God's character more fully and are raised to share in His life and glory. Thomas Aquinas wrote that the grace of God elevates human nature to participate in the divine life, though not to become God in essence.\n\nWhat orthodox Christianity emphatically rejects is the notion that human beings can become God in the ontological sense—that is, coming to possess the divine nature as their own, becoming self-existent and eternal in the way God is. The creature-creator distinction remains absolute. Human beings, no matter how glorified, remain creatures who depend entirely on their Creator for existence. They do not and cannot become gods in the sense of having divine nature essentially. As Augustine wrote, God made us, but we did not make ourselves, and we cannot unmake this creaturely dependence.\n\nThe LDS view, by contrast, suggests that humans can actually progress to become gods in the full ontological sense—beings who are eternal, self-existent, and creators of their own worlds and beings. This collapses the fundamental distinction between Creator and creature that orthodox theology considers essential to both sound doctrine and appropriate worship.\n\n### The Character of Salvation and Sanctification\n\nA third area of departure concerns the nature of salvation and sanctification. Orthodox Christian theology emphasizes that salvation is fundamentally a gift of grace, received through faith, rather than something earned by human effort or merit. While good works are the fruit of genuine faith and evidence of transformation, they are not the basis of acceptance with God. This grace-centered understanding guards against spiritual pride and maintains human dependence on God's mercy.\n\nLDS theology, while also emphasizing grace, intertwines it with an extensive system of ordinances, temple rituals, and faithful observance that are viewed as necessary conditions for attaining exaltation. The doctrine of eternal progression implies that salvation is achieved through a combination of divine grace and human effort, where progression toward godhood depends on worthy choices and temple covenants. This framework, while sincere in its devotion, shifts the emphasis toward human achievement in a way that orthodox theology would consider incompatible with the biblical witness of salvation by grace alone through faith alone.\n\n## Points of Convergence and Shared Concerns\n\nDespite these significant differences, there are areas where LDS teaching resonates with historic Christian concerns, and acknowledging these promotes fair and accurate understanding.\n\nBoth orthodox Christianity and LDS theology share a high view of human potential and destiny. Both reject the notion that human beings are merely material accidents or that mortality is a punishment to be escaped. Both affirm that human beings are created in the image of God and that the ultimate destiny of the righteous involves glory, joy, and the blessed presence of God. The LDS emphasis on eternal progression reflects a biblical concern that believers are called to grow in holiness and that their final state involves positive blessing rather than mere exemption from punishment.\n\nAdditionally, both traditions affirm the biblical language of becoming like God in terms of character and moral resemblance. Scripture calls believers to be \"imitators of God\" (Ephesians 5:1) and promises that when Christ appears, we \"shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is\" (1 John 3:2). The LDS aspiration to develop godlike attributes—love, patience, compassion, and righteousness—reflects this biblical vision, even if the theological framework for understanding how this occurs differs significantly.\n\nBoth traditions also affirm the importance of human agency and the reality that choices matter. Neither embraces a fatalism that renders human effort meaningless. The LDS framework of eternal progression emphasizes that worthy choices accumulate over time and across eternities, which, while theologically problematic in its full expression, reflects a legitimate concern that the moral quality of our souls is not incidental to our ultimate destiny.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe statement \"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become\" is not consistent with orthodox Christian theology. The teaching fundamentally alters the biblical understanding of God's nature by suggesting divinity is an achieved status rather than an eternal essence. It redefines the creature-creator distinction by envisioning humans as potential gods in the ontological sense. It implicitly embraces a polytheistic framework that contradicts the monotheistic witness of Scripture and the historic creeds.\n\nHowever, it would be uncharitable and inaccurate to dismiss LDS teaching as merely antithetical to Christianity. Beneath these significant doctrinal differences lies a sincere desire to understand God's nature and human destiny, to affirm the value of mortal life, and to aspire to the glorious future God has prepared for His children. The departure, while real and significant, occurs within a context of shared reverence for Scripture (though interpreted differently), commitment to following Jesus, and hope in eternal life.\n\nFor orthodox Christians engaging with LDS friends and neighbors, these points of convergence provide common ground for relationship and dialogue, while the doctrinal differences remind us of the importance of clear articulation of historic Christian teaching regarding God's nature, human destiny, and the way of salvation. The conversation between these traditions, conducted with respect and charity, can enrich mutual understanding even as it clarifies where genuine disagreement remains.",

            "The statement that “the universe contains many gods” is a contested paraphrase of LDS teaching. While LDS theology speaks of exalted beings and plural aspects of divinity in a broader sense, there is not a universally agreed-upon, explicit doctrine in current canonical LDS sources that equates this with a clear, explicit polytheism; treating it as a settled, universal LDS position can be misleading.",
            "The response sometimes presents the LDS claim as an unambiguous ontological ascent to full, independent godhood (“beings who are eternal, self-existent, and creators of their own worlds”). LDS theology emphasizes exaltation and divine likeness within the Creator/creature distinction, but the precise metaphysical scope of “becoming like God” is debated and nuanced within LDS and within broader Christian critique; a blanket statement may oversimplify the position.",
            "The treatment of salvation in LDS terms as a “grace-centered” plan with a heavy emphasis on ordinances and temple rites is broadly accurate for many LDS explanations, but the summary risks implying a single, uniform view of salvific process across all LDS members. LDS soteriology is diverse in emphasis (faith, grace, temple covenants, obedience) and can be described differently by various LDS authors and institutions."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer is strong in outlining orthodox Christian concerns (God’s eternal, unchanging nature; the Creator-creature distinction; theosis as participation in divine life but not ontological equality). It correctly notes the LDS emphasis on eternal progression and the distinct LDS view of God as a Father who was once mortal and who, along with beings on other worlds, can be exalted. It also correctly identifies areas of convergence (sanctification, moral growth, becoming like God in character) and divergence (ontological deification, nature of God, and the salvific framework). However, it contains at least three historically or doctrinally sensitive simplifications or misstatements (canonical status of Lectures on Faith, explicit universal polytheism, and the precise scope of “becoming like God” within LDS ontology), which prevent a perfect assessment. Overall, the analysis is solid and largely aligns with orthodox critique, with some need for careful nuance in LDS specifics. "
