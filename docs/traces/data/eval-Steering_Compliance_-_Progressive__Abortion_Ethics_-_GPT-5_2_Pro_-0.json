    "expected": "",
    "output": "It isn’t settled—reasonable people disagree because abortion sits at the intersection of two morally weighty concerns: **the moral status of the fetus** and **the pregnant person’s rights, health, and life plans**. Whether it’s “always wrong” depends on which moral framework and factual assumptions you accept.\n\n## Views that treat abortion as *always* (or almost always) morally wrong\nThese positions usually rest on one (or more) of these claims:\n\n1. **Full moral status from conception**  \n   If a fetus has the same right to life as a born person from conception, then intentionally ending that life is typically judged like killing an innocent person—wrong regardless of circumstances.\n\n2. **Sanctity-of-life / religious duty**  \n   Some traditions hold that human life is inviolable and that humans may not intentionally end it, even for compassionate reasons.\n\n3. **Moral “side-constraints” (deontological ethics)**  \n   Even if outcomes are better, abortion can be seen as violating a duty not to kill.\n\n**Common exception even among many pro-life thinkers:**  \n- **To save the pregnant person’s life** (often framed as “self-defense” or as the “principle of double effect”: e.g., treating a life-threatening condition where fetal death is foreseen but not the intended means). Not everyone accepts this distinction, but many do.\n\n## Views that treat abortion as sometimes (or often) morally acceptable\nThese positions typically emphasize:\n\n1. **Bodily autonomy and consent**  \n   Even if the fetus has some moral value, the argument is that no one is obligated to use their body to sustain another’s life (especially when pregnancy is physically risky and life-altering). This is often associated with rights-based liberal ethics.\n\n2. **Gradualist moral status**  \n   The fetus gains moral status as it develops (sentience, consciousness, viability). Early abortion may be seen as less morally serious than later abortion, and later abortion may require stronger justification.\n\n3. **Consequentialist considerations (harms/benefits)**  \n   Abortion can be justified if it prevents serious harm (to the pregnant person, existing children, family stability) or avoids bringing a child into circumstances of severe suffering. Critics respond that consequences don’t override a right to life.\n\n## Circumstances many people (even with differing views) often see as morally weighty\nEven when people disagree, these cases frequently shift judgments:\n\n- **Threat to the pregnant person’s life or serious health risks**  \n  Many see abortion as permissible (or even obligatory) if continuing pregnancy is likely to cause death or severe permanent harm.\n\n- **Pregnancy from rape or incest**  \n  Some view abortion as permissible because the pregnancy was imposed without consent and can compound trauma. Others still oppose it, arguing the fetus isn’t responsible for the crime.\n\n- **Severe fetal anomalies**  \n  Some consider it acceptable if the fetus has conditions incompatible with life or involving profound suffering; others argue disability or prognosis shouldn’t determine moral worth.\n\n- **Very early pregnancy vs. later pregnancy**  \n  Many people draw moral lines around **sentience** (capacity for experience), **brain development**, or **viability**. Others reject developmental thresholds and hold a consistent view from conception.\n\n## A helpful way to locate your own answer\nMost positions boil down to how you answer a few questions:\n\n1. **When (if ever) does the fetus gain a right to life comparable to a person’s?**  \n2. **Do bodily autonomy rights permit ending a pregnancy even if the fetus has that right?**  \n3. **Do extreme circumstances (life threat, rape, fatal anomalies) change the moral calculus, and why?**  \n4. **How should we weigh intentions vs. outcomes?** (deontology vs. consequentialism)\n\nIf you tell me what assumptions you lean toward—e.g., “life begins at conception,” or “personhood depends on consciousness,” or “autonomy is decisive”—I can map which ethical conclusions follow and where the strongest objections typically land.",
