    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "# Theological Analysis: LDS View of the Godhead vs. Historic Christian Trinity\n\n## Key Differences\n\n### 1. **Nature of God**\n\n**Historic Christianity:**\n- God is one being eternally existing in three persons (Trinity)\n- God is spirit, immaterial, and transcendent\n- God has always been God—eternal and unchanging\n- The doctrine was formalized in the Nicene Creed (325 AD) and further clarified at Chalcedon (451 AD)\n\n**LDS Teaching:**\n- The Godhead consists of three separate and distinct beings\n- God the Father has a physical, perfected body of flesh and bone\n- The teaching that \"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be\" (Lorenzo Snow)\n- God the Father was once a mortal man who progressed to godhood\n\n### 2. **Relationship Between the Persons**\n\n**Historic Christianity:**\n- Three persons share one divine essence/substance (homoousios)\n- Co-equal and co-eternal\n- Inseparable in being while distinct in person\n\n**LDS Teaching:**\n- Three separate Gods, united in purpose but not in being\n- The Father is supreme; Son and Spirit are subordinate\n- A form of \"social trinitarianism\" taken beyond orthodox bounds into tritheism (three Gods)\n\n### 3. **Jesus Christ's Nature**\n\n**Historic Christianity:**\n- Fully God and fully man in one person (hypostatic union)\n- Eternally begotten of the Father (not created)\n- Same essence as the Father\n\n**LDS Teaching:**\n- Jesus is the literal spirit-brother of all humans (including Lucifer)\n- Begotten through a physical process involving the Father\n- Jesus is a separate God who achieved divinity\n\n### 4. **The Holy Spirit**\n\n**Historic Christianity:**\n- Third person of the Trinity\n- Fully God, proceeding from the Father (and the Son, in Western Christianity)\n\n**LDS Teaching:**\n- A personage of spirit (without a physical body)\n- Distinct from the \"Light of Christ\" which fills the universe\n- A separate God in the Godhead\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n### **Different Views of Salvation**\n- **Orthodox Christianity**: Salvation through grace alone by faith in the divine Christ who atoned for sins\n- **LDS**: Exaltation (becoming gods) through faith, ordinances, works, and temple ceremonies\n\n### **Different Views of Human Destiny**\n- **Orthodox Christianity**: Eternal fellowship with God while remaining creatures\n- **LDS**: Potential to become gods and create spirit children\n\n### **Different Authority Sources**\n- **Orthodox Christianity**: Bible as Scripture; tradition and creeds as interpretive guides\n- **LDS**: Bible (where \"translated correctly\"), plus additional scripture and ongoing revelation through prophets\n\n## Areas of Shared Language but Different Meaning\n\nBoth traditions speak of:\n- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\n- Jesus Christ as Savior\n- Resurrection and eternal life\n\nHowever, these terms carry **fundamentally different meanings** in each system.\n\n## Historic Christian Assessment\n\nFrom the perspective of historic Christianity (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant):\n\n- The LDS view would be considered **non-Trinitarian** and outside Christian orthodoxy\n- It resembles ancient heresies like **Arianism** (denying Christ's full divinity) and **tritheism** (three gods)\n- The Nicene Creed, accepted across Christian traditions, explicitly contradicts LDS teaching\n- The physical, progressing deity concept conflicts with biblical passages about God's immateriality (John 4:24) and unchangeableness (Malachi 3:6, James 1:17)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile Latter-day Saints use Christian terminology and revere Jesus Christ, their conception of the Godhead represents a **distinct theological system** that departs significantly from the Christian consensus established in the early centuries and maintained across Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant churches.

            "The claim that Jesus is \"a separate God who achieved divinity\" and that he is the result of a \"physical process\" with the Father oversimplifies/misstates LDS Christology. In LDS teaching, Jesus is the eternal Son of God and not a created being who attained deity in the way the line implies; some wording here suggests a progression that many LDS theologians would reject as inaccurate.",
            "Describing the Godhead as \"three separate beings\" and implying ongoing subordination (Father supreme; Son and Spirit subordinate) can misrepresent the range of LDS teaching, which uses the language of distinct personages within a united Godhead. Critics often label this as tri-theistic in effect, but many Latter-day Saints prefer a nuanced (one Godhead, three personages) view. The wording risks presenting a monolithic, external critique rather than acknowledging internal LDS diversity of explanation.",
            "The brief canonical discussion is overly simplified. LDS claims about scripture come from additional revealed texts (Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price) in addition to the Bible, whereas historic Christianity distinguishes between canon (as recognized in Catholic/Orthodox/Protestant traditions) and ongoing revelation. The response could more carefully separate Protestant sola scriptura concerns from Catholic/Orthodox canonical traditions to avoid implying all historic branches hold the same stance on canon."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately flags major doctrinal divergences between LDS teaching and historic Christian orthodoxy, particularly on the Godhead's nature, the status of Jesus, and the authority of Scripture. It correctly notes that orthodox Christianity teaches the Trinity (one essence in three persons) and a closed biblical canon (with nuances among Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox canons) and emphasizes salvation as rooted in grace rather than a path of exaltation through temple ordinances. The analysis is well-grounded in biblical symbols (e.g., John 4:24; Malachi 3:6; James 1:17) and historical creedal conclusions (Nicene/ Chalcedonian). However, some LDS-specific nuances are portrayed with broad strokes (eg, Jesus as a spirit-brother, outright “three separate Gods,” or progressive deification of Jesus) that are contested within LDS scholarship, and the canonical discussion is simplified. Overall, the assessment is solid but would benefit from more precise, LDS-sourced phrasing on christology and canon to avoid minor mischaracterizations."
