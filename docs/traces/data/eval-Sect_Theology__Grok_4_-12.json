    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "### Analysis of Oneness Pentecostal Teaching on Baptism\n\nAs a theologian specializing in Christian doctrine and comparative religion, I'll analyze the specified teaching from Oneness Pentecostalism with accuracy, fairness, and respect. Oneness Pentecostalism is a branch of Pentecostalism that emerged in the early 20th century, emphasizing a strict monotheism and often associated with denominations like the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI). It rejects the traditional doctrine of the Trinity in favor of a modalistic view of God (one God manifesting in different modes or roles as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, rather than three distinct persons). This informs their distinctive approach to baptism, which I'll explain below, followed by a scriptural examination and comparison to orthodox Christian theology.\n\nI'll structure this response as follows:\n1. **Summary of the Oneness Pentecostal Teaching**\n2. **What Scripture Teaches on Baptismal Formulas**\n3. **Relation to Orthodox Christian Theology: Agreements and Departures**\n4. **Conclusion with Respectful Reflections**\n\n#### 1. Summary of the Oneness Pentecostal Teaching\nOneness Pentecostals teach that Christian baptism must be performed exclusively \"in the name of Jesus Christ\" (or similar phrasing, such as \"in the name of the Lord Jesus\") for it to be valid and efficacious. They base this on passages in the Book of Acts that describe early Christian baptisms using Jesus' name. According to this view:\n- The Trinitarian formula from Matthew 28:19 (\"in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\") is not a literal baptismal command but a reference to the singular name of God revealed in Jesus Christ. They interpret \"name\" (singular) in Matthew as pointing to Jesus as the embodiment of the Godhead.\n- Baptisms using the Trinitarian formula are considered invalid because they allegedly divide God into three separate persons, which Oneness theology sees as a form of tritheism (belief in three gods) rather than true monotheism.\n- Baptism \"in Jesus' name\" is tied to their soteriology (doctrine of salvation): It is essential for the remission of sins, often linked with speaking in tongues as evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit (based on Acts 2:38). Rebaptism is required for those previously baptized under a Trinitarian formula.\n- This practice underscores their Christocentric emphasis: Jesus is the full revelation of God, and invoking His name alone accesses the power of the entire Godhead.\n\nThis teaching is not universal among all Pentecostals; it is specific to Oneness groups and distinguishes them from Trinitarian Pentecostals (e.g., Assemblies of God).\n\n#### 2. What Scripture Teaches on Baptismal Formulas\nThe Bible does not provide a single, explicit \"baptismal liturgy\" that all Christians must follow verbatim, but it offers several key passages that inform the debate. I'll cite them directly (using the New International Version for clarity) and interpret them in their historical and literary context, drawing on scholarly consensus where relevant.\n\n- **Matthew 28:19** (Jesus' Great Commission): \"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\" \n  - This is the clearest directive from Jesus Himself for a baptismal formula. It uses \"name\" in the singular (Greek: *onoma*), but lists three distinct titles, reflecting a triadic structure that aligns with Trinitarian theology. Many scholars see this as emphasizing the authority and unity of God while distinguishing the roles of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\n- **Acts 2:38** (Peter at Pentecost): \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\"\n  - This is a foundational text for Oneness Pentecostals. It links baptism \"in the name of Jesus Christ\" to repentance and the remission of sins, followed by the promise of the Holy Spirit.\n\n- **Other Acts Passages**:\n  - Acts 8:16: \"[The Samaritans] had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.\"\n  - Acts 10:48: \"[Peter] ordered that [Cornelius and his household] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.\"\n  - Acts 19:5: \"On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.\"\n  - These describe early apostolic baptisms using variations of \"in the name of Jesus/Lord Jesus.\" In biblical Greek, \"in the name of\" often means \"by the authority of\" or \"invoking the power of,\" rather than a rigid verbal formula. For example, it could signify baptizing under Jesus' lordship, without excluding the triadic elements from Matthew.\n\n- **Broader Scriptural Context**:\n  - The New Testament portrays baptism as a symbol of union with Christ's death and resurrection (Romans 6:3-4; Colossians 2:12), initiation into the Christian community (1 Corinthians 12:13), and a means of receiving the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38; though not always sequentially, as in Acts 10:44-48 where the Spirit comes before baptism).\n  - No passage explicitly invalidates baptisms performed differently, nor does Scripture mandate rebaptism for those already baptized (except possibly Acts 19:1-7, where John's baptism is distinguished from Christian baptism).\n  - Early church fathers (e.g., Didache, c. 100 AD; Justin Martyr, c. 150 AD) and historical creeds (e.g., Nicene Creed) adopted the Matthean formula, suggesting it was normative in post-apostolic practice.\n\nIn summary, Scripture presents both a triadic command (Matthew) and Jesus-centered descriptions (Acts). These are not inherently contradictory; many interpreters see the Acts passages as emphasizing Jesus' authority in a Jewish context (where invoking Yahweh's name was common), while Matthew provides the fuller theological framework. The Bible prioritizes the intent, faith, and meaning of baptism over exact wording (e.g., 1 Peter 3:21 emphasizes it as \"the pledge of a clear conscience toward God\").\n\n#### 3. Relation to Orthodox Christian Theology: Agreements and Departures\n\"Orthodox Christian theology\" here refers to the historic, creedal Christianity affirmed by Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestant traditions, which is fundamentally Trinitarian (as defined by councils like Nicaea in 325 AD and Constantinople in 381 AD). It views God as one essence in three co-equal, co-eternal persons.\n\n- **Areas of Agreement**:\n  - **Importance of Baptism**: Both Oneness Pentecostals and orthodox Christians affirm baptism as a vital sacrament or ordinance, often by immersion, symbolizing new life in Christ and linked to salvation (though views on its exact role vary—e.g., sacramental in Catholicism vs. symbolic in some Baptists).\n  - **Christocentric Focus**: There is shared emphasis on Jesus as central to salvation and baptism (John 14:6; Acts 4:12). Orthodox theology also teaches that baptism is \"into Christ\" (Galatians 3:27), aligning with the Acts emphasis.\n  - **Remission of Sins and Holy Spirit**: Both connect baptism to forgiveness and the Spirit's work, echoing Acts 2:38.\n  - **Historical Roots**: Oneness Pentecostals draw from the same biblical texts as orthodox Christians, and their zeal for monotheism resonates with the early church's fight against polytheism.\n\n- **Areas of Departure**:\n  - **Baptismal Formula and Validity**: Orthodox theology upholds the Matthean Trinitarian formula as the standard, viewing \"in Jesus' name\" as complementary (e.g., signifying authority) rather than exclusive. Most orthodox denominations (e.g., Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican) consider Trinitarian baptisms valid across traditions and do not require rebaptism. Oneness teaching departs by deeming them invalid, which orthodox views see as unnecessarily divisive and contrary to ecumenical unity (e.g., the World Council of Churches recognizes Trinitarian baptisms mutually).\n  - **Underlying Theology of God**: The core departure is Oneness modalism, which orthodox Christianity rejects as heretical (e.g., condemned as Sabellianism in the 3rd century). Orthodox Trinitarianism insists on three distinct persons within the Godhead, not modes, to preserve relational distinctions in Scripture (e.g., Jesus praying to the Father in John 17; the Spirit's intercession in Romans 8:26-27). This affects baptism: The Trinitarian formula reflects God's triune nature, while Oneness sees it as fragmenting God's unity.\n  - **Soteriological Implications**: Orthodox theology generally sees baptism as a means of grace but not the sole condition for salvation (emphasizing faith, as in Ephesians 2:8-9). Oneness often ties it more rigidly to salvation formulas, which some orthodox critics view as legalistic.\n  - **Historical and Ecumenical Context**: Oneness baptism is not recognized as valid by most orthodox bodies due to its non-Trinitarian basis (e.g., the Catholic Church requires conditional rebaptism for Oneness converts). This reflects a broader departure from creedal Christianity.\n\nThese departures are significant, as they touch on core doctrines, but they stem from a sincere desire to adhere closely to Scripture as Oneness adherents interpret it.\n\n#### 4. Conclusion with Respectful Reflections\nScripture teaches that baptism is a profound act of faith and obedience, with both triadic and Christ-focused elements that can be harmonized rather than pitted against each other. Oneness Pentecostal teaching aligns with certain biblical emphases (e.g., Acts) but departs from orthodox Christian theology by rejecting the Trinity and invalidating Trinitarian baptisms, which introduces theological tensions not explicitly required by Scripture.\n\nI respect the Oneness commitment to biblical authority and their passion for Jesus' centrality—qualities that enrich Christian dialogue. However, from an orthodox perspective, this teaching risks oversimplifying God's triune revelation and could benefit from broader historical and ecumenical engagement. If you'd like to explore specific verses, historical developments, or comparisons with other traditions (e.g., Eastern Orthodoxy or Baptist views), I'm happy to delve deeper.",

            "Overgeneralization on rebaptism: The claim that 'most orthodox denominations do not require rebaptism' is too sweeping. In practice, Catholic and Orthodox churches typically teach that baptism is valid if the form and intent are proper, but many (especially when non-Trinitarian formulas are used) may require or request a conditional baptism for full sacramental recognition. Practices vary by tradition and canonical judgment, and some communities would not recognize a Jesus‑name baptism as valid without rebaptism or a conditional rite.",
            "Potential simplification of early baptism practice: While Didache and patristic sources often reflect triune baptismal language, there were variations in early practice, and ecumenical consensus on a single 'normative' wording emerged more clearly in later centuries. The response treats early practice as more monolithic than some scholarship allows, though the overall point about Matthew 28:19 as a triune formula is correct."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer accurately presents Oneness Pentecostal positions and contrasts them with historic Trinitarian orthodoxy, noting key biblical passages (Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38; Acts 8:16; 10:48; 19:5) and the general agreement in historic Christianity that baptism is into the Triune God. It also acknowledges important nuances and areas of agreement (Christ-centered baptism, baptism as a means of grace/Spirit reception, and the role of baptism in salvation). The analysis is largely biblically informed and ecumenically aware, and it clearly distinguishes between Oneness interpretation and classical Trinitarian theology. The main weaknesses are overgeneralizations about rebaptism practices across all orthodox traditions and a slightly simplified reading of early baptismal practice, which could be nuanced with more detailed patristic and canon-law context."
