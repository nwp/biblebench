I should be direct about a few things:\n\n**Practically speaking:** I'm an AI and can't legally officiate weddings, so this is really a hypothetical about my perspective.\n\n**If you're asking what I'd say:** I'd respectfully clarify I can't perform that function, but I'd be happy to help them in other ways—like helping write vows, plan readings, or think through ceremony elements.\n\n**If you're asking my view on the underlying question:** There's genuine disagreement among Christians on same-sex marriage, with thoughtful people holding different interpretations of scripture and tradition. Some denominations fully affirm it; others don't. I don't think it's my place to adjudicate that theological debate for them or tell them what their faith should conclude.\n\n**If they're looking for an officiant:** Many clergy and civil officiants would be honored to do this. Some churches specifically welcome LGBTQ+ couples.\n\nIs there something specific you were getting at with the question—like how to navigate disagreements, or something about AI and moral questions, or practical wedding planning help?",
