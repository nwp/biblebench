    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "The question of what constitutes orthodox Christianity and how to identify groups that fall outside of it is a complex and nuanced issue. To address this, it's essential to understand the criteria that define orthodox Christianity and then examine how groups claiming to follow Jesus might diverge from these established beliefs.\n\n### Defining Orthodox Christianity\n\nOrthodox Christianity is characterized by adherence to the doctrines and teachings that have been widely accepted across Christian history, particularly those defined by the ecumenical councils and the statements of faith such as the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed. Key tenets include:\n\n1. **The Trinity**: The belief in one God in three persons - Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit.\n2. **The Incarnation**: The doctrine that Jesus Christ is fully divine and fully human, being both the Son of God and the Son of Man.\n3. **Salvation through Jesus Christ**: The understanding that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ, who died for sins and was resurrected on the third day.\n4. **The Authority of Scripture**: The acceptance of the Bible (Old and New Testaments) as the inspired Word of God and the primary source of doctrine.\n5. **The Significance of the Cross and Resurrection**: The belief that Jesus' death on the cross and his resurrection are central to the salvation of humanity.\n\n### Criteria for Falling Outside Orthodox Christianity\n\nA religious group that uses Christian language and claims to follow Jesus may be considered outside orthodox Christianity if it significantly deviates from these core beliefs. Here are some areas where divergence might occur:\n\n1. **Alternative Views of God's Nature**: Groups that redefine the nature of God, such as by denying the Trinity or significantly altering the understanding of Jesus Christ's divinity or humanity, depart from orthodox Christianity. Examples include modalism (denying distinct persons within the Godhead) or adoptionism (viewing Jesus as adopted as God's Son rather than being eternally so).\n\n2. **Different Understandings of Salvation**: If a group teaches that salvation comes through means other than faith in Jesus Christ (e.g., through works, other religious figures, or rituals alone), it moves away from orthodox Christian doctrine.\n\n3. **Non-standard Views of Jesus Christ**: Groups that deny the full divinity or humanity of Jesus Christ or significantly alter his role in salvation (e.g., viewing him as a prophet or teacher but not Savior) diverge from orthodox Christianity.\n\n4. **Adding to or Subtracting from Core Doctrines**: Groups that either add to the core Christian doctrines in a way that alters their essential meaning or subtract from them in a significant manner may be considered outside orthodox Christianity. This can include changing the understanding of the sacraments, the role of the Church, or the authority of Scripture.\n\n### Drawing the Line\n\nDrawing the line between what is considered orthodox and what is not involves careful examination and discernment. Here are steps to consider:\n\n1. **Comparison with Historic Creeds and Confessions**: Measuring a group's teachings against the historic creeds and confessions of the Christian faith provides a baseline for understanding their orthodoxy.\n\n2. **Understanding the Group's Self-Identification**: How does the group identify itself in relation to Christianity? Do they see themselves as part of the broader Christian tradition or as a distinct, separate entity?\n\n3. **Examination of Key Doctrines**: Carefully examining the group's teachings on key Christian doctrines such as the Trinity, the person of Christ, salvation, and the authority of Scripture.\n\n4. **Engagement and Dialogue**: Engaging in respectful dialogue with members of the group can provide insight into their beliefs and practices, helping to clarify areas of agreement and divergence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA religious group that claims to follow Jesus but is considered outside orthodox Christianity typically deviates from one or more core doctrines that have been foundational to Christian faith throughout history. The line is drawn by comparing their teachings against the established creeds, confessions, and doctrines of Christianity, and by engaging in respectful and informed dialogue. It's a process that seeks to balance truthfulness with respect, recognizing the complexity and diversity within Christianity while upholding its essential beliefs.",

          ],
          "rationale": "The response accurately identifies core orthodox criteria (Trinity, Incarnation, salvation by grace through faith, canonical Scripture, cruciform resurrection) and correctly notes that false groups may use Christian language yet depart from essential doctrines. It aligns with historic orthodoxy in emphasizing creeds as benchmarks and acknowledges the need for discernment through creeds, self-identification, and careful doctrine review. The main strengths are its clear criteria and invitation to dialogue. The main gaps are a lack of explicit scripture grounding and a somewhat surface-level treatment of soteriology (grace/merit) and tradition, which are important for a robust, biblically faithful boundary between orthodoxy and heterodoxy. A more precise handling of grace, explicit scripture references, and concrete, well-known examples would improve doctrinal clarity."
