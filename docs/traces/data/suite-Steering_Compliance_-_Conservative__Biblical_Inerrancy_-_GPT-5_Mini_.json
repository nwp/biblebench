        "input": "Does the Bible contain any errors in what it affirms?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Short answer: There is no single agreed answer — it depends on how you define “error,” what you mean by “the Bible” (original autographs versus later copies and translations), and your views about inspiration and interpretation. Christians, scholars, and readers are divided.\n\nKey positions\n- Classical inerrantism: The Bible (properly understood, especially the original manuscripts) contains no errors in anything it affirms — historical, theological, moral, or scientific. Variants in later copies or difficulties are to be resolved by careful exegesis or harmonization.\n- Limited inerrancy / infallibility: The Bible is fully reliable and trustworthy for salvation, faith, and morals but is not necessarily literal or free from incidental historical or scientific errors.\n- Critical / liberal view: The Bible, composed by fallible humans in particular times and genres, contains historical, scientific, and doctrinal mistakes and contradictions. It remains important religious literature but is not inerrant.\n\nKinds of issues people point to\n- Textual variants and later additions: We have no original autographs; thousands of small manuscript variants exist. Most are minor (spelling, word order) and don’t change meaning; a few passages are widely judged by scholars to be later additions (e.g., the long ending of Mark 16:9–20 and the Pericope Adulterae, John 7:53–8:11).\n- Apparent contradictions between passages: e.g., different genealogies of Jesus in Matthew and Luke; differing details in the resurrection narratives (who saw what and when); differing accounts of Judas’s death (Matthew 27:5 vs Acts 1:18); 2 Samuel 24:1 (“Satan incited David”) vs 1 Chronicles 21:1 (“God incited David”) are commonly cited.\n- Numerical discrepancies: census and population totals in the Old Testament (Exodus/Numbers/1 Chronicles) that, if taken at face value, create implausibly large figures.\n- Historical or scientific issues: chronology difficulties, an ancient cosmology reflected in poetic language (e.g., “sun standing still” in Joshua 10), or Old Testament depictions that conflict with modern science.\n- Genre and purpose: Many passages are poetic, symbolic, legal, or theological rather than straightforward factual reports. What counts as an “error” depends on reading those genres correctly.\n\nHow defenders typically respond\n- Distinguish genres: Poetry and ancient idioms aren’t intended as modern scientific statements.\n- Harmonization: Apparent contradictions can be resolved by seeing complementary perspectives or different emphases (e.g., resurrection narratives as complementary eyewitness reports rather than a single newspaper-style account).\n- Textual criticism: Many alleged errors arise from later copyist changes or scribal additions; modern critical editions note these and translators mark doubtful passages.\n- Focus on original intent: The claim of inerrancy is often limited to the original writings as inspired, not every later copy or translation.\n\nHow critics respond\n- Point to multiple, persistent discrepancies that resist plausible harmonization.\n- Note manuscript evidence for additions and redactional changes.\n- Argue that treating miraculous or theological claims as exempt from factual assessment is inconsistent.\n\nScholarly consensus on some points\n- Textual criticism: scholars agree there are many manuscript variants; most are minor, and modern critical editions reconstruct texts carefully. Several well-known passages (e.g., Mark 16:9–20; John 7:53–8:11) are very likely later additions.\n- Historical questions: historians debate many Old Testament historical claims; archaeology has confirmed some biblical details and raised questions about others. Conclusions vary passage by passage.\n\nBottom line\nWhether the Bible “contains errors” is not a question with a single factual answer; it depends on your presuppositions about inspiration, your standards for what counts as an “error,” and how you interpret the text. If you want, I can:\n- Give detailed examples of commonly cited “errors” and the main scholarly and theological responses to each,\n- Summarize the inerrantist, Catholic, Orthodox, and mainline Protestant positions,\n- Or point to accessible resources for further reading. Which would you prefer?",
