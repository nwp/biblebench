    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "In the study of Christian doctrine, theologians use the term \"orthodoxy\" (from the Greek *orthos* meaning \"straight\" and *doxa* meaning \"glory\" or \"belief\") to describe the boundary of essential teachings that define the faith.\n\nWhen a group uses Christian vocabulary—speaking of Jesus, salvation, and the Bible—but is categorized as \"heterodox\" or \"outside\" orthodoxy, it is usually because they have redefined the foundational nature of God, the person of Jesus, or the mechanism of salvation.\n\nHere is the theological framework used to identify where those lines are drawn.\n\n### 1. The Ontological Line: The Nature of God (The Trinity)\nThe most significant line of demarcation is the doctrine of the **Trinity**. Orthodox Christianity (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant) maintains that there is one God who eternally exists in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\n*   **Where groups fall outside:** If a group teaches **Unitarianism** (God is only one person), **Modalism** (God is one person who wears three different \"masks\"), or **Tritheism** (the Father, Son, and Spirit are three separate gods), they depart from the historic creeds (Nicene and Athanasian).\n*   **The Conflict:** Many groups that claim Jesus but are outside orthodoxy view the Trinity as a later pagan \"corruption\" of the faith, whereas orthodox theology views it as the necessary biblical revelation of God’s nature.\n\n### 2. The Christological Line: The Identity of Jesus\nOrthodoxy is defined by **Chalcedonian Christology**: the belief that Jesus is fully God and fully man (the Hypostatic Union). He is \"begotten, not made\" and \"consubstantial\" (of the same substance) with the Father.\n\n*   **Where groups fall outside:**\n    *   **Arianism:** Teaching that Jesus was the first and greatest *creation* of God, but not God himself (e.g., Jehovah’s Witnesses).\n    *   **Docetism/Gnosticism:** Teaching that Jesus was divine but only *appeared* to be human.\n    *   **Adoptionism:** Teaching that Jesus was a mere man who \"became\" divine or the Son of God at his baptism or resurrection.\n*   **The \"Line\":** If Jesus is reduced to a \"great teacher,\" a \"created angel,\" or a \"highly evolved man,\" the group has moved outside the orthodox circle.\n\n### 3. The Soteriological Line: How One is Saved\nOrthodox Christianity teaches that salvation is a work of God’s grace, initiated by God, and received through faith because of the substitutionary death and resurrection of Jesus.\n\n*   **Where groups fall outside:**\n    *   **Exclusivism to the Organization:** Teaching that salvation is only possible through membership in their specific modern organization rather than through Christ alone.\n    *   **Works-Righteousness:** Adding mandatory human requirements (rituals, specific diets, or secret knowledge) as necessary additions to Christ’s work for salvation.\n*   **The \"Line\":** While denominations disagree on the *mechanics* of baptism or the sacraments, a group falls outside orthodoxy if they teach a \"different gospel\" (cf. Galatians 1:8) that makes salvation something humans earn or something only their specific sect controls.\n\n### 4. The Authority Line: Revelation and Scripture\nHistoric Christianity holds to the \"Canon\"—the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments—as the final authority for faith and practice.\n\n*   **Where groups fall outside:**\n    *   **New Primary Revelation:** Adding \"Third Testaments\" or new books of scripture that supersede or contradict the Bible (e.g., The Book of Mormon).\n    *   **Infallible Living Oracles:** Claiming a modern leader has the authority to issue new doctrines that override the historic consensus of the Church.\n*   **The \"Line\":** While traditions like Roman Catholicism value Sacred Tradition, they view it as a stream flowing from the original apostolic deposit. Groups move outside orthodoxy when a new leader or text fundamentally alters or replaces the biblical foundation.\n\n### 5. The Boundary Markers: The Ecumenical Creeds\nTheologians generally use the **Nicene Creed (381 AD)** and the **Apostles’ Creed** as the \"litmus test\" for orthodoxy. These documents were not meant to be exhaustive, but to serve as a \"fence\" around the faith.\n\n*   If a group cannot confess the Nicene Creed in good conscience, they are generally considered to be part of a \"New Religious Movement\" (NRM) or a \"Restorationist\" group rather than part of the orthodox Christian family.\n\n### Summary\nDrawing the line is not about a lack of sincerity or a judgment on the \"goodness\" of the people in a group. Rather, it is about **theological continuity**. To be \"orthodox\" is to stand in the stream of belief that can be traced back to the early Church's interpretation of the Apostles' teaching.\n\nWhen a group changes the **Who** (Jesus as the eternal God), the **Who Else** (The Trinity), or the **How** (Grace through Faith), they are using the *language* of Christianity to describe a fundamentally different *religion*.",

            "The response claims the Protestant-C Christian canons consist of 66 books as the universal final canon for all historic Christianity. In reality, Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions include additional books (deuterocanon/apocrypha or broader canons), while Protestant Bibles typically have 66 books. Hence, the scriptural canon is not uniformly 66 across all historic Christian communions.",
            "The line drawing is framed largely around creedal boundaries, which is traditional, but the treatment glosses over real canonical diversity (e.g., Catholics and Orthodox affirm Sacred Tradition alongside Scripture) and over-simplifies the ecumenical-to-protestant spectrum. This makes the “orthodoxy” boundary look more uniformly definable than it is in practice.",
            "The claim that “Orthodox Christianity (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant)” share a single orthodox boundary is historically imprecise. Protestant groups are not universally considered part of “Orthodox Christianity” in the historical sense anchored to the ecumenical councils; they are often described as within the broader Christian family but not as “orthodox” in the same way as Catholic/Orthodox. This conflation could mislead readers about historic boundaries.",
            "The response uses the 66-book canon as a gating criterion without acknowledging the variance among major Christian traditions regarding canon (Catholic: 73 books in the Latin/Old Testament; Orthodox: varies by jurisdiction but generally accepts additional books beyond 66). This is a factual error that undermines doctrinal clarity.",
            "Some nuances could be deeper: while affirming creedal standards is standard, Eastern Orthodoxy stresses the ongoing role of tradition and the Church Fathers in interpreting Scripture, while many Protestants emphasize sola Scriptura. The LLM could acknowledge these legitimate disagreements about authority and interpretation rather than treating creeds as the sole boundary markers."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer provides a solid overall framework for orthodoxy (Trinity, full deity and humanity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, affirmed canon, Christ’s resurrection and return, and the authority of Scripture). It correctly emphasizes that groups using Christian language can be outside orthodoxy if they deny or radically reinterpret core doctrines. However, its major factual flaw is the claim that the canonical Bible is universally the 66-book canon for all historic Christian traditions. Catholic and Orthodox canons include additional books, and this distinction matters for how Scripture and tradition are viewed as authorities. The response also blends historic Orthodox/Catholic bounds with Protestant ones, which can blur the precise boundary between “orthodoxy” and broader Christian heterodoxy. Despite these issues, the answer captures important nuances about the boundaries set by creeds and core doctrines and correctly cites that deviations in the core identities of God and Christ, or in the gospel, mark groups as outside orthodox Christianity."
