    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",
    "output": "Here is an explanation of the divergence between Charismatic/Pentecostal (Continuationist) and Cessationist theologian perspectives regarding spiritual gifts.\n\n### Common Ground: The Work of the Spirit\n\nBefore exploring the differences, it is vital to establish the unity shared by both traditions within orthodox Christianity. Both groups are Trinitarian and firmly believe in the divinity and personhood of the Holy Spirit. Both affirm that the Holy Spirit is active and essential in the world today for:\n1.  **Regeneration:** Bringing the spiritually dead to life in Christ.\n2.  **Sanctification:** Growing believers in holiness and the \"Fruit of the Spirit\" (Galatians 5:22-23).\n3.  **Illumination:** Helping believers understand and apply Scripture.\n\nThe disagreement does not concern *whether* God gives gifts to His children, but rather *which* specific gifts are intended for the permanent life of the Church and *how* those gifts function today.\n\n---\n\n### The Charismatic and Pentecostal Perspective (Continuationism)\n\nChristians in this camp generally hold to **Continuationism**—the belief that all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament (specifically in 1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12, and Ephesians 4) are available to the Church today and will continue until Christ returns.\n\n**1. The Biblical Basis:**\nProponents point to the \"Great Commission\" and the events of Acts as the normative model for the Church age. They often cite Hebrews 13:8 (\"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever\") to argue that if Jesus empowered His disciples to heal and prophesy then, He does so now. They urge that Scripture nowhere explicitly states that these gifts would be withdrawn before the Second Coming.\n\n**2. The Function of Sign Gifts:**\nPentecostals and Charismatics place a high value on what are often called \"sign gifts\" or \"miraculous gifts,\" primarily speaking in tongues, prophecy, and healing.\n*   **Tongues:** Seen as either a private prayer language for edification or a prophetic message for the congregation (when interpreted). For classical Pentecostals, speaking in tongues is often the initial physical evidence of the \"Baptism in the Holy Spirit.\"\n*   **Prophecy:** Generally viewed not as adding new doctrine to Scripture, but as God giving spontaneous encouragement, warning, or specific guidance to believers for the current moment.\n*   **Healing:** Viewed as a manifestation of God's Kingdom breaking into the present world, available through the faith of the believer and the empowerment of the Spirit.\n\n**3. The Theological Motivation:**\nThe heart of this position is a desire for the **dynamic power** of God. They believe that doing the works of Jesus requires the power of Jesus, and that the Church is crippled in its mission without the supernatural empowerment promised in Acts 1:8.\n\n---\n\n### The Cessationist Perspective\n\nChristians in this camp (often found in Reformed, Lutheran, and some Baptist traditions) hold to **Cessationism**. This is the view that the miraculous \"sign gifts\" were given for a specific time and purpose—the apostolic age—and ceased once that purpose was fulfilled.\n\n**1. The Biblical Basis:**\nCessationists often point to Ephesians 2:20, which describes the church as being built on the \"foundation of the apostles and prophets.\" They argue that a foundation is laid only once. Furthermore, they interpret 1 Corinthians 13:8-10 (where Paul says prophecies and tongues will cease when \"the perfect comes\") as referring to the completion of the Biblical canon or the maturity of the Church, rather than the Second Coming.\n\n**2. The Function of Sign Gifts:**\nCessationists believe the primary purpose of miracles, tongues, and prophecy in the New Testament was to **authenticate** the Apostles as messengers of God before the New Testament Scriptures were complete (Hebrews 2:3-4).\n*   **Tongues:** Often interpreted as known human languages given supernaturally to spread the Gospel rapidly and as a sign of judgment against unbelieving Israel, a purpose that is now historically complete.\n*   **Prophecy:** Viewed as infallible revelation. Because the Canon of Scripture is closed, Cessationists argue that there is no more need for new revelation. To claim \"God told me\" risks undermining the sufficiency of Scripture (*Sola Scriptura*).\n*   **Healing:** Cessationists distinguish between *miracles* and the *gift of miracles*. They believe God still heals and answers prayer today, but that the specific *office* or *gift* of a healer (who can heal at will) has ceased with the Apostles.\n\n**3. The Theological Motivation:**\nThe heart of this position is a desire for the **doctrinal purity** and **sufficiency** of the Word. They seek to protect the Church from subjectivity and false teaching by grounding all authority in the finished work of Scripture rather than in subjective experience.\n\n---\n\n### Key Distinctions on Specific Gifts\n\nTo summarize the practical differences, here is how the two groups typically view specific phenomena:\n\n| Gift | Charismatic/Pentecostal View | Cessationist View |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Prophecy** | Spontaneous revelation for edification, guidance, or comfort. It must be tested against Scripture but is a vital, ongoing way God speaks to His people. | New revelation has ceased. \"Prophecy\" today is essentially \"preaching\"—the forthtelling of God's written Word, not the foretelling of new events. |\n| **Tongues** | A supernatural prayer language (personal) or a message to the church (public, requiring interpretation). | Supernatural ability to speak unlearned foreign languages for apostolic authentication; this gift has ceased. |\n| **Healing** | The \"gift of healing\" resides in the Church today; believers should pray with the expectation that God desires to heal supernaturally. | God heals today through prayer and providence in accordance with His sovereign will, but individuals no longer possess the apostolic \"gift/power\" to heal. |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the debates between these groups can sometimes be sharp, it is fair to say that both positions are motivated by a desire to honor God.\n*   **Cessationists** warn against the danger of elevating experience over Scripture.\n*   **Continuationists** warn against the danger of an intellectualized faith that lacks power.\n\nMany theologians today also occupy a middle ground (often called \"Third Wave\" or \"Open but Cautious\"), believing that while miracles and prophecy are possible today, they must be approached with discernment and strictly measured against the Bible. Regardless of their stance on the sign gifts, orthodox believers across this spectrum affirm the Gospel: salvation by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.",

            "Tongues: The cessationist entry treats tongues primarily as a sign gift for apostolic authentication and as known languages from Acts; in practice, cessationist positions vary on whether tongues were known languages or ecstatic/uninterpreted speech, and many do not frame it strictly as 'authentication' in the way the table implies. This is an area with significant historical debate and should be presented as one common explanation among several.",
            "Prophecy: The cessationist column states that prophecy today is essentially preaching/forthtelling of Scripture. While many cessationists do limit prophecy to exhortation and teaching, some orthodox positions allow ongoing prophetic exhortation that is tested against Scripture; the simplification may blur existing nuance about how prophecy is defined and evaluated.",
            "Healing: The line about a separate 'gift of miracles' office that ceased is a standard cessationist stance, but it conflates two related debates: (a) whether miraculous healings continue today (often affirmed in some form by many non-cessationists) and (b) whether there exists a permanent, operable 'gift of healing' as a distinct office. This distinction is debated and not universally agreed among cessationists or continuationists.",
            "Canon/“perfect” interpretation: The claim that cessationists commonly equate “the perfect” with the completion of the canon or with church maturity is widely taught but contested. Some scholars interpret “the perfect” as eschatological consummation rather than as canon closure, so labeling it as a universally agreed cessationist interpretation would be an overgeneralization."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response overall is solid and aligns with mainstream Protestant positions on continuationism vs. cessationism and rightly emphasizes core biblical/theological motifs (foundation on apostles/prophets, the sufficiency of Scripture, etc.). However, some nuances in the treatment of tongues, prophecy, and the “perfect” passage are simplified or represent one popular interpretation rather than describing the full spectrum of cessationist and Charismatic/continuationist thought. Minor inaccuracies or overgeneralizations in these areas reduce the precision slightly, though the core distinctions and arguments are accurately represented."

It presents Charismatic/Pentecostal continuationism and cessationist viewpoints with comparable emphasis, outlines their biblical bases and practical views on tongues, prophecy, and healing, and notes a middle-ground position (Open but Cautious). It emphasizes common ground in orthodox Christian belief and the authority of Scripture, and it affirms the gospel confession regardless of stance. It does not advocate for a single denomination. A potential limitation is that it largely frames the debate within Protestant categories (e.g., Reformed, Lutheran, Baptist) and does not explicitly engage Catholic or Orthodox perspectives on charismatic gifts. Nevertheless, the overall tone and structure aim for balance and ecumenicity."
