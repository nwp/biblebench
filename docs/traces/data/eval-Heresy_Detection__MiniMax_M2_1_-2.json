    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "# Theological Analysis: Salvation by Works\n\n## Classification: Heresy (Pelagianism/Semi-Pelagianism)\n\nThis statement represents **Pelagianism**, a heresy that has been repeatedly condemned by the historic Christian church.\n\n## Church Historical Context\n\nThe doctrine described here was most prominently taught by **Pelagius** (c. 354–c. 418), a British monk who opposed Augustine of Hippo's teachings on grace. The church decisively rejected Pelagianism at:\n\n- **Council of Carthage (418)**: Condemned Pelagius's teachings\n- **Council of Ephesus (431)**: Affirmed Augustine's teachings on grace\n- **Synod of Orange (529)**: Further condemned Semi-Pelagianism\n\nThe Second Council of Orange declared that human beings are so corrupted by sin that they cannot turn to God without divine grace—\"prevenient grace\" that precedes and enables any human response.\n\n## Biblical Analysis\n\nThis teaching contradicts clear scriptural teachings:\n\n**Ephesians 2:8-9** states: *\"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\"*\n\n**Romans 3:20**: *\"For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight.\"*\n\n**Titus 3:5**: *\"He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy.\"*\n\n**Galatians 2:21**: *\"I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.\"*\n\n## Key Theological Problems\n\n1. **Denies Sola Gratia**: The statement eliminates grace as essential to salvation, reducing Christianity to moralism\n2. **Eliminates Atonement's Necessity**: If humans can earn heaven, Christ's death becomes unnecessary\n3. **Creates Boasting**: Those who live \"good lives\" would have grounds for self-congratulation rather than humble gratitude\n4. **Contradicts Total Depravity**: Scripture teaches all have sinned (Romans 3:23), making earning salvation impossible\n\n## Orthodox Position\n\nHistoric Christianity teaches that salvation is **by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone**. Good works are the **fruit** of salvation, not its **basis**. Christians are saved **unto** good works (Ephesians 2:10), not **by** them. As the Augsburg Confession states: \"Men cannot be justified before God by their own strength, merits, or works, but are justified for Christ's sake through faith.\"\n\nThis teaching represents a fundamental inversion of the gospel—replacing the free gift of redemption with human achievement.",

            "Overly confident labeling: The response treats the statement as unequivocally Pelagian. Some theologians distinguish between Pelagianism and semi-Pelagianism (or moralistic, synergistic views) and would argue the latter may better describe the ‘initial grace’ debate. The evaluation could acknowledge this as a spectrum rather than a single label.",
            "Use of “prevenient grace” attribution: The exact historical language of the Second Council of Orange is nuanced. Describing it as teaching “prevenient grace that precedes and enables any human response” is broadly aligned with anti-Pelagian emphasis, but modern terms like “prevenient grace” carry Arminian coloration and can obscure the Council’s subtler position on grace and cooperation.",
            "Total depravity linkage: The claim that the statement “contradicts Total Depravity” presumes a Reformed framework as the standard. Eastern Orthodoxy and many other traditions affirm human sinfulness and need for grace without endorsing the específica Reformed category of total depravity. This point could be clarified rather than asserted as a universal contradiction.",
            "James 2:14-26 not explicitly engaged: While the answer rightly notes that works are the fruit of faith, it misses the canonical tension in James 2 (faith without works is dead) which illuminates the precise role of works in justification and sanctification in biblical theology.",
            "Ecumenical scope caveat: Quoting Augsburg Confession as representative of all historic Christianity is inaccurate. It reflects Lutheran Protestant–not universal Catholic/Orthodox teaching. The section would benefit from acknowledging broader catholic (universal) perspectives on grace and justification."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s response is strong on core points: it accurately identifies the claim as a works-based stance and contrasts it with biblical teaching (grace through faith). It gives solid scriptural grounding (Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:20; Titus 3:5; Galatians 2:21) and aligns with historic orthodoxy that good works are fruit, not basis, of salvation. It also correctly locates the issue within a long-standing debate about grace, human will, and justification (Pelagian/semipelagian concerns). However, there are nuanced areas where precision could improve: labeling the view as pure Pelagian without acknowledging semi-Pelagian nuances, the anachronistic but common term “prevenient grace” in this historical-orthodox context, and the broader interpretive space on total depravity and James’ teaching on faith and works. Also, the discussion leans Protestant-reformational language (e.g., sola gratia) without noting that Orthodox/Catholic perspectives emphasize synergy with grace. Despite these gaps, the core assessment is accurate, biblically grounded, and the nuance is broadly captured. "
