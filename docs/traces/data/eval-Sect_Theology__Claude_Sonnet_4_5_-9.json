    "expected": "No, this contradicts core biblical teaching. Scripture affirms that sin is real and separates us from God (Romans 3:23, Isaiah 59:2). Sickness and death are real consequences of living in a fallen world (Genesis 3, Romans 5:12). Jesus didn't treat sickness as an illusion - he healed real diseases and raised people from actual death. His crucifixion was a real physical death for real sin (1 Peter 2:24). Christian Science's denial of sin's reality undermines the need for Christ's atoning sacrifice. If sin isn't real, the cross becomes unnecessary. Orthodox Christianity teaches that sin, sickness, and death are tragically real, which is precisely why we need a real Savior who truly died and was truly resurrected.",

            "The characterization of Christian Science as denying the Incarnation may oversimplify CS's position. CS typically interprets Jesus as the exemplar of divine Truth (the Christ) rather than teaching that God literally became flesh in the sense of a traditional Incarnation. Some adherents would distinguish Jesus’ humanity from a literal hypostatic union, so labeling CS as denying the Incarnation can be contested and nuanced."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall the response accurately presents Christian Science as teaching that sin, sickness, and death are not real realities but mortal beliefs to be corrected by spiritual understanding, and it contrasts this with orthodox biblical teaching. It correctly cites key biblical motifs (the reality of sin, the fallen world, Jesus’ healing ministry, and the reality of death) and notes the main orthodox implications (need for real atonement, real incarnation, and physical resurrection). A notable area for nuance is CS’s stance on incarnation and atonement: CS reframes or softens the traditional categories (e.g., the Incarnation and substitutionary atonement) rather than outright denying them in every sense. Including that nuance would strengthen precision.)"
