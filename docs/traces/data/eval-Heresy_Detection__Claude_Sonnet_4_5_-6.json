    "expected": "While 'Jesus is Lord' is foundational (Romans 10:9), orthodox Christianity requires additional essential beliefs about WHO Jesus is. The early creeds developed to combat heresies: Jesus must be confessed as fully God and fully human (against Arianism and Docetism), the Trinity must be affirmed (against modalism), salvation by grace through faith (against works-righteousness), and the authority of Scripture. These essential doctrines form the core of historic Christian orthodoxy.",

            "Omission of explicit emphasis on the authority and sufficiency of Scripture (canon and inspiration) as essential to orthodox belief; the response relies on Scripture passages but does not explicitly affirm Scripture as the authoritative norm for doctrine.",
            "Lack of explicit articulation of justification by grace through faith (as a core soteriological principle) alongside the atonement, which is traditionally paired with faith as the means of salvation in orthodox teaching.",
            "A somewhat simplified claim about Adoptionism using the phrase 'Jesus is Lord' to combat heresy; while the point about early heresies is broadly true, the historical nuances are more complex and would benefit from careful qualification."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer is strong in affirming that 'Jesus is Lord' is foundational but not sufficient, and it correctly cites key biblical texts (Rom 10:9; 1 Cor 12:3; 1 Cor 15:3-4; 1 John 4:2-3; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14) and the role of the creeds. It captures important doctrinal essentials: Christ’s deity and humanity, the Trinity, the resurrection, and the atonement, and it recognizes the historical creeds as defining orthodoxy. However, it misses an explicit emphasis on Scripture’s authority as the norm for doctrine (the canon and inspiration), and it does not plainly articulate justification by grace through faith (a central soteriological point in orthodox teaching). It also presents a simplified note on Adoptionism that could be nuanced. Overall, it is largely accurate and nuanced but would be strengthened by explicitly tying orthodoxy to the authority of Scripture and to justification by faith."
