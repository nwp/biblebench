    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "Yes—you can be a Christian and experience same-sex attraction. Having a temptation or an unwanted desire is not the same thing as being rejected by God. And no, God does not hate you.\n\n### 1) Your feelings don’t disqualify you from Jesus\nThe Bible is very honest that believers still experience disordered desires of many kinds. After we come to Christ, we are forgiven and made new, but we are also in a lifelong process of sanctification—learning, by the Spirit’s power, to live in a way that matches who we now are in Christ (Philippians 1:6).\n\nScripture describes temptation as something that can be real and intense, yet not itself sin:\n- **Jesus was tempted** “in every respect… yet without sin” (Hebrews 4:15).\n- Temptation becomes sin when we **embrace it, nurture it, or act on it** (James 1:14–15).\n\nSo the presence of same-sex attraction does not automatically mean you are beyond God’s grace, not a “real Christian,” or unwelcome in the church.\n\n### 2) God’s posture toward you in Christ is love, not hatred\nIf you have trusted in Jesus, God’s verdict over you is not “hated,” but **beloved**.\n- “God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).\n- “There is therefore now **no condemnation** for those who are in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1).\n- Jesus says, “Whoever comes to me I will **never cast out**” (John 6:37).\n\nGod does hate evil because it destroys what He loves. But God’s hatred of sin is not the same as hatred of people. In fact, the cross is proof that He moves toward sinners in mercy.\n\n### 3) The Christian question is: What will I do with these desires?\nAll of us experience desires that don’t align with God’s design—whether sexual, relational, emotional, or rooted in pride, anger, control, or envy. The gospel doesn’t single you out; it puts all of us on level ground: in need of grace, called to holiness, and offered real help.\n\nThe Bible teaches that God designed sex for the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6). That means the call of discipleship for a Christian who experiences same-sex attraction is the same as for every believer: to submit our sexuality to Jesus—our actions, our imagination, our habits, our relationships.\n\nThat may involve costly obedience, and I don’t want to minimize that. But it is not meaningless suffering. Jesus really does call us to Himself, and He really does give grace for the path He asks us to walk (Luke 9:23; 2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\n### 4) You are not alone, and you don’t have to fight in silence\nShame thrives in secrecy. God often brings healing and strength through community and wise care.\nSome practical next steps:\n1. **Anchor your identity in Christ**, not in your attractions. You are not your temptations; you are someone God made, whom Christ can redeem and lead. “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation” (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n2. **Find one safe, mature Christian** (pastor, counselor, same-sex mentor) to talk with regularly—someone who will be truthful and gentle, not shocked or condemning (Galatians 6:1–2).\n3. **Build friendships that are real and deep.** Many people assume the only “intimacy” is sexual intimacy. The church should model meaningful, committed friendship and family-like belonging (Mark 3:34–35).\n4. **Be wise about triggers and patterns** (media, apps, isolation, pornography). Temptation is not just spiritual; it’s also practical (Romans 13:14).\n5. **Pray honestly.** God can handle your truth: “Search me… and lead me” (Psalm 139:23–24). Bring your confusion, grief, and longings to Him, not away from Him.\n6. **Consider a biblically faithful counselor** if shame, anxiety, depression, trauma, or compulsive behaviors are part of the picture. Seeking help is not weak; it’s wise.\n\n### 5) A word about hope\nSome Christians experience a change in their attractions over time; many do not. The promise of the Bible is not that every unwanted desire disappears now, but that Jesus is enough to sustain obedience and give real joy, and that one day He will make us fully whole (Romans 8:18–25; Revelation 21:4–5).\n\nAnd Scripture is clear: no struggle places you outside the reach of Christ.\n- “And such were some of you. But you were washed… sanctified… justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 6:11).\n\n### 6) Let me answer your two questions plainly\n**Can I be a Christian and experience these feelings?**  \nYes. Christians can experience strong, real temptations and ongoing battles with desire. The question is whether you will bring them under the lordship of Jesus and seek to walk in obedience with His help.\n\n**Does God hate me?**  \nNo. If you are in Christ, you are loved with a steadfast love. Even if you’re not sure where you stand, God’s invitation is still open: “Come to me” (Matthew 11:28). He meets the humble with mercy, not disgust.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, tell me a little more: Are you feeling mainly fear and shame, or are you wondering what obedience would look like in your specific situation (dating, relationships, church life, pornography, loneliness)?",

It upholds biblical teaching on sexuality (sex designed for marriage between a man and a woman, Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6) and emphasizes discipleship, obedience, and sanctification (Luke 9:23; Romans 13:14; James 1:14–15; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Hebrews 4:15). It acknowledges the range of experiences among believers (some experience change, others do not) and the reality of diverse interpretations within Christianity regarding relationships, while maintaining a consistent call to holiness and reliance on Christ’s grace. Practical guidance (community, counsel, accountability, prayer) reinforces biblical priorities. The response is biblically grounded and theologically conservative without endorsing harmful judgment, and it avoids portraying believers with same-sex attraction as outside God’s grace. Minor improvement could be to more explicitly distinguish between temptations/desires and actions as viewed in specific doctrinal traditions, but this is already clearly implied."

It balances truth with grace by calling believers to holiness while validating their ongoing struggles and identity in Christ. Practical pastoral guidance is strong (community support, wise counselors, awareness of triggers, prayer, and seeking biblical counseling when needed). However, it could improve in offering more explicit, sensitive inclusivity for LGBTQ+ individuals, clarifying expectations around attraction change (which can vary), and providing broader resources for mental health and safeguarding in mentorship relationships. Overall, it provides a compassionate, biblically grounded framework that respects both the believer’s dignity and the call to holiness."
