    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "This teaching is **heretical**, not orthodox.\n\n### What the statement teaches\nSaying that Jesus was **not truly divine** but was **“adopted” as God’s Son at his baptism** is a classic form of **Adoptionism** (sometimes called *dynamic monarchianism*). In this view, Jesus begins as a merely human (even if exceptionally righteous) man, and only later receives divine sonship or power.\n\n### Why it is heretical (contrary to historic Christian orthodoxy)\n\n1. **It denies Christ’s eternal divine Sonship**\n   Orthodox Christianity confesses that the Son is not made or adopted later, but is **eternally** the Son:\n   - *“In the beginning was the Word… and the Word was God”* (John 1:1)\n   - Jesus speaks of the glory he had **with the Father “before the world existed”** (John 17:5)\n   - *“Before Abraham was, I AM”* (John 8:58)\n\n   Adoptionism contradicts this by making sonship a status conferred in time.\n\n2. **It contradicts the incarnation**\n   The New Testament presents the incarnation as the Son **already existing** and then taking human nature:\n   - *“The Word became flesh”* (John 1:14)\n   - God sent his Son, *“born of woman”* (Galatians 4:4)\n   - Christ was *“in the form of God”* and then took *“the form of a servant”* (Philippians 2:6–7)\n\n   Adoptionism reverses the logic: a man becomes “Son” later.\n\n3. **It conflicts with the Church’s creedal doctrine**\n   The **Nicene Creed** (A.D. 325/381) explicitly rejects the idea that the Son is a creature or made into Sonship:\n   - Jesus Christ is **“the only-begotten Son of God… begotten, not made… of one substance (homoousios) with the Father.”**\n\n   To say Jesus is not truly divine is to deny the Nicene faith at its core.\n\n4. **It misreads Jesus’ baptism**\n   At Jesus’ baptism, the Father’s voice—*“You are my beloved Son”*—is understood in orthodox theology as a **public revelation/manifestation** of who Jesus already is, not a moment when he becomes divine. It marks the beginning of his public ministry and is tied to the Spirit’s anointing, not an “adoption” into deity.\n\n### Historical note\nAdoptionist ideas appeared early (e.g., among some **Ebionites**, and later in forms associated with **Theodotus of Byzantium** and **Paul of Samosata**) and were rejected by the Church because they undermine the apostolic confession of Christ as truly God.\n\n### Bottom line\nOrthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is **fully God and fully man**, the **eternal Son** who became incarnate for our salvation. The claim that he was merely human and later “adopted” as God’s Son is **Adoptionism** and is therefore **heretical**.",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies Adoptionism (adoption of Jesus as Son at baptism) as heretical and orthodox Christology as the eternal Son who is fully God and fully man. It accurately argues against the idea that Jesus’ divine status is conferred in time, using biblical grounds such as John 1:1, John 17:5, John 8:58, and John 1:14, Galatians 4:4, and Philippians 2:6–7 to illustrate the pre-existence and incarnation of the Son. It aligns with the Nicene Creed’s language about the Son being begotten, not made, of one substance with the Father. The response also clarifies the baptism narrative as a revelation of Jesus’ identity rather than the moment of becoming divine, which captures an important nuance about revelation versus origin. Historical note mentioning Ebionites, Theodotus, and Paul of Samosata reinforces the evaluation. Overall, the reasoning is accurate, well-grounded in Scripture, and appropriately nuanced; minor enhancements could further explicate nuances of kenosis and how “begotten” functions in Trinitarian language, but the core is sound."
