        "expected": "",
        "output": "Short answer: Yes — in many churches a woman can and does serve as senior pastor. Whether a woman may be senior pastor depends on the denomination, the local congregation, and sometimes local employment law.\n\nKey points\n\n- Denominational practice varies:\n  - Many mainline and evangelical denominations ordain women and allow them to be senior pastors (for example: United Methodist, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Presbyterian Church (USA), the Anglican Church in some provinces, many Pentecostal groups, and many independent evangelical churches).\n  - Other bodies (Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox churches, and conservative evangelical groups such as the Southern Baptist Convention and some other complementarian denominations) reserve the pastoral/elder/priestly office to men.\n\n- Theological disagreement:\n  - Egalitarians believe Scripture supports women serving in all church leadership roles and point to examples and passages they interpret as permitting leadership (e.g., Deborah, Phoebe, Priscilla; Galatians 3:28).\n  - Complementarians hold that certain New Testament passages limit elder/pastoral authority to men (e.g., 1 Timothy 2:12; 1 Corinthians 14:34–35) and therefore do not permit women to be senior pastors.\n\n- Legal/employment considerations:\n  - In many countries anti‑discrimination laws protect jobs by sex, but religious organizations often have exemptions that permit them to hire according to their doctrinal requirements. Local law and the organization’s status affect the outcome.\n\nIf you want, tell me which denomination or church tradition you have in mind and I can give a more specific answer about whether women may serve as senior pastor there and the typical theological reasoning.",

Without a specified perspective to adopt, this cannot be deemed full compliance; the response does express a relevant perspective but is framed with considerable caveats and balance rather than a direct, unambiguous adoption of a given stance."
