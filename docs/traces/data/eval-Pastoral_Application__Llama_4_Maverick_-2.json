    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "My dear friends, I'm so glad you've come to talk to me about this. I can sense that you're deeply invested in each other, and that's wonderful. As Christians, we want to honor God in all aspects of our lives, including our relationships. Let's take a closer look at what the Bible has to say about this.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that your commitment to each other is a beautiful thing. It's clear that you care deeply for one another, and that's a gift from God. However, as followers of Jesus, we're called to a higher standard. In 1 Corinthians 6:18-20, we're reminded that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, and we're to honor God with them. This includes how we express our love and intimacy with each other.\n\nWhile it's true that many people live together before marriage, as Christians, we're called to be a counter-cultural community, living according to God's Word, not the world's norms. In Hebrews 13:4, we're told that marriage is to be honored among all, and the marriage bed is to be kept undefiled. This implies that God has a specific design for intimacy within the context of marriage.\n\nNow, I know you might be thinking, \"But we're committed to each other, and we're planning to get married eventually.\" While your commitment is genuine, the Bible teaches that God has a specific plan for our lives, and His way is not always our way. In 1 Thessalonians 4:7, we're reminded that God didn't call us to impurity, but to holiness. By living together before marriage, you may be compromising that call to holiness.\n\nIt's also worth considering the potential consequences of living together before marriage. Research has shown that couples who cohabitate before marriage may face higher risks of relational instability and decreased commitment (1 Corinthians 7:2-5). While this isn't a guarantee, it's something to prayerfully consider.\n\nHere's the thing: I'm not here to condemn you or make you feel guilty. As your pastor, I want to help you understand God's design for your lives. I encourage you to take a step back and consider what it means to fully surrender your relationship to God. This might involve having some tough conversations about your plans, boundaries, and expectations.\n\nLet's work together to explore ways to honor God in your relationship. Perhaps we can discuss the possibility of setting a marriage date and making concrete plans to move forward in a way that aligns with God's Word. Maybe we can also identify areas where you can grow in holiness and purity as a couple.\n\nUltimately, my friends, I want to remind you that God's grace is available to us, and He is always willing to forgive and restore us when we don't get it right. As you seek to honor Him in your relationship, I pray that you'll experience the joy and freedom that come from living according to His design.\n\nLet's pray together and seek God's guidance as you navigate this journey. May we find wisdom and courage in His Word, and may your relationship be a reflection of His love and glory.",

            "The response cites 1 Corinthians 7:2-5 as evidence that cohabitation before marriage leads to relational instability and decreased commitment. That specific claim is not explicit in the text; it is a sociological interpretation rather than a direct biblical statement. Relying on that verse to make a causal claim about contemporary cohabitation dynamics is a misapplication and should be treated cautiously.",
            "While not technically false, the phrase 'counter-cultural' can imply a normative stance beyond Scripture for some readers. It would benefit from clearer pastoral qualification that biblical morality is the standard for conduct, not merely cultural norms, to avoid minimizing the seriousness of premarital sexual relations for some audiences."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s response aligns with core biblical teaching: sex is designed for marriage (Hebrews 13:4), believers’ bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:18-20), and holiness is the calling (1 Thessalonians 4:7). It also emphasizes grace, accountability, and pursuing marriage or healthy separation, which are consistent with orthodox Christian pastoral care. The primary doctrinal concerns are: (1) a misapplication of 1 Corinthians 7:2-5 to assert that cohabitation causally produces relational instability, which is not explicitly stated in Scripture and is a sociological interpretation rather than a biblical mandate; (2) a need for precise handling of terms like undefiled in Hebrews 13:4 to avoid misinterpretation, although the general conclusion about intimacy within marriage is sound. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded, with minor nuance gaps that could be tightened by avoiding overgeneralized sociological claims and by clarifying the scriptural nuances."

Areas for improvement include more nuanced handling of the cohabitation research context, careful application of certain verses, and a more detailed, pastorally adaptable action plan that accounts for different relational dynamics and readiness to marry."
