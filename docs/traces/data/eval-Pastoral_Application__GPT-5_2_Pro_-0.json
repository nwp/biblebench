    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "I’m really sorry. Hearing that from your daughter can feel like the floor drops out from under you. Your fear and grief make sense—and you’re not a failure as a parent because your child is struggling. Many faithful parents in Scripture knew the pain of watching someone they love wander or question (think of the father in Luke 15, waiting and watching for his son).\n\nHere are some steps to take that hold truth and grace together.\n\n## 1) Start by bringing your fear to the Lord\nBefore you try to “fix” this, take your devastation to God honestly.\n\n- **Pray like a parent who needs help:** “Lord, I believe; help my unbelief” (Mark 9:24).  \n- Remember: God loves your daughter more than you do, and He is not panicked. *“Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you”* (1 Peter 5:7).\n\nWhen we’re afraid, we can be tempted to control. Prayer re-centers us in trust.\n\n## 2) Don’t react with panic, shame, or lectures—move toward her with calm love\nYour daughter took a risk telling you. How you respond next will shape whether she feels safe to keep talking.\n\n- Aim for “quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger” (James 1:19).  \n- Let your tone communicate: **“I love you. I’m not going anywhere. I’m glad you told me.”**  \n- Avoid threats or ultimatums (“If you don’t believe, then…”). Fear may produce compliance, but it rarely produces faith.\n\nLove that listens is not compromise; it’s Christlike posture.\n\n## 3) Ask gentle questions to understand what she means by “questioning”\nTeenagers can use “I don’t believe” to describe a wide range of things: intellectual doubts, disappointment with hypocrisy, anxiety, shame, trauma, unanswered prayer, identity struggles, or simply the normal process of owning a faith that was once borrowed.\n\nTry questions like:\n- “What led you to feel this way?”  \n- “Is this mostly about questions you can’t answer, or pain you can’t resolve?”  \n- “When did you start feeling distant from God?”  \n- “What do you think God is like?” (Sometimes they’re rejecting a caricature, not the true God.)  \n- “Would you tell me what you *do* believe right now?”\n\nYour goal is not to win a debate; it’s to learn her story.\n\n## 4) Keep the gospel central: faith is ultimately God’s work, not your control\nYou have influence, but you don’t have ultimate control over her heart. Scripture is clear that new life is God’s gift (John 3:3–8). That’s humbling—but also comforting.\n\nKeep holding out Christ:\n- The core question is not “Can I keep my child religious?” but “Who is Jesus, and can He be trusted?”  \n- *“Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ”* (Romans 10:17). Keep Scripture and the story of Jesus present in your home—not as a weapon, but as bread.\n\n## 5) Make your home a place where doubts can be discussed without fear\nDoubt can be a crossroads: it can harden into unbelief, or it can become the path to deeper, owned faith. Many believers in Scripture wrestled honestly (Psalms of lament; Thomas in John 20).\n\nYou might say:\n- “I’m not afraid of your questions.”  \n- “We can explore this together.”  \n- “I may not have every answer, but I won’t stop loving you or listening.”\n\nThis doesn’t mean you treat truth as optional. It means you make room for honest seeking.\n\n## 6) Look for the “real issue”: head, heart, or community\nOften it’s one (or a mix) of these:\n\n**Head (intellectual):** questions about science, suffering, Bible reliability, other religions.  \n**Heart (personal):** grief, depression, anxiety, guilt, shame, prayer that felt unanswered, feeling like God is distant.  \n**Hands/community (church experience):** hypocrisy, harshness, legalism, political conflation, judgment, a painful experience with Christians.\n\nEach category needs a different kind of care. If it’s intellectual, read and discuss good resources together. If it’s emotional, she may need space, counseling, and gentle spiritual support. If it’s community-related, she may need to see healthier Christianity embodied.\n\n## 7) Keep healthy spiritual rhythms—without making them a battlefield\nIf church and youth group become constant conflict, you may win attendance and lose her heart. On the other hand, abandoning all spiritual life can communicate that faith is a hobby.\n\nConsider a wise middle path:\n- Keep Sunday worship as a family expectation **if possible**, but hold it with gentleness and conversation.  \n- Invite, don’t coerce, into prayer and Bible reading.  \n- Emphasize relationship: meals, shared activities, time together.  \n- If she refuses certain practices, don’t respond with rage; respond with steadiness and love.\n\nYou’re playing the long game.\n\n## 8) Involve wise, trusted help—don’t carry this alone\nIt’s appropriate to bring in support, carefully and respectfully:\n- A youth pastor, mature woman in the church, or a trusted mentor—someone who can be safe, non-reactive, and thoughtful.  \n- If anxiety, depression, self-harm, trauma, or intense distress is present, seek a **qualified Christian counselor** (and medical support if needed). This is not a lack of faith; it’s wise stewardship.\n\nAlso, guard her trust: don’t make her the topic of prayer gossip. Share only with those who will be discreet and helpful.\n\n## 9) Examine your own posture—and repent where needed\nThis is tender, but important. Sometimes a child’s doubt exposes ways the faith was presented as performance, pressure, or mere rule-keeping.\n\nAsk yourself:\n- Have I made Christianity feel like “be good so God accepts you,” instead of grace in Christ? (Ephesians 2:8–9)  \n- Have I been more reactive than relational?  \n- Have I modeled confession and repentance, or only demanded it?  \n\nIf you need to apologize for harshness, do it. Humility can soften a hardened moment.\n\n## 10) Hope in God’s pursuing mercy\nYour daughter is not beyond God’s reach. Jesus is the Shepherd who goes after the wandering sheep (Luke 15:4–7). Keep hope without denial, and confidence without control.\n\nA prayer you might pray:\n> “Lord, open her eyes to see Jesus as beautiful and true. Protect her from lies. Bring wise voices into her life. Use even these questions to draw her to Yourself. Give me patience, courage, and gentleness.”\n\n## What to say to her this week (a simple script)\nYou could say something like:\n> “Thank you for trusting me with that. I’m sad because I love you and I love the Lord, but I’m not angry. I want to understand what you’re thinking and feeling. Can we talk more about what brought you here? No matter what, I love you, and I’m here.”\n\n## A few practical next steps\n1. Set a calm time to talk (walk, coffee, drive—less intense than face-to-face at the table).  \n2. Listen and write down her main objections/questions without rebutting every point.  \n3. Choose one question to explore together each week.  \n4. Invite a trusted mentor into her life.  \n5. Pray daily for her—and ask God to make you a safe place.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a little more: **What exactly did she say, and what seems to be underneath it—questions, hurt, or something happening socially?** I can help you think through how to respond in your specific situation.",
