    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "# A Pastoral Response on Cohabitation\n\nThank you for your honesty in coming to me with this question. I appreciate your openness, and I want to respond with both truth and love.\n\n## The Biblical Foundation\n\nYes, living together sexually before marriage does conflict with God's design, but let me explain why this matters:\n\n**God's design for sex is within marriage.** Scripture consistently presents sexual intimacy as reserved for the covenant of marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5). This isn't arbitrary—God designed it this way for our flourishing, not to restrict our joy.\n\n**\"Everyone does it\" doesn't change God's standard.** Romans 12:2 calls us not to be conformed to the pattern of this world. Jesus himself said the road is narrow (Matthew 7:13-14). Biblical faithfulness has often meant going against cultural currents.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nGod's boundaries around sexuality aren't about control—they're about **protection and purpose**:\n\n- **Covenant before consummation** creates security and models Christ's commitment to the Church (Ephesians 5:25-32)\n- Sexual intimacy is designed to unite what's already publicly, legally, and spiritually united\n- Living as though you're married without the covenant can create false security and delay important discernment\n\n## The Grace-Filled Path Forward\n\nIf you're truly committed to each other **and** to following Christ:\n\n1. **Consider why you haven't married yet.** If you're ready to live together, what's preventing marriage? This might reveal important issues to address.\n\n2. **Make a clear decision.** Either marry (if that's the right step) or establish separate living arrangements while you prepare properly for marriage. This may feel costly, but obedience often is.\n\n3. **Seek accountability and support.** Don't walk this alone—involve your church community.\n\n## A Word of Encouragement\n\nRepentance isn't about shame—it's about turning toward life. God's grace is abundant for all who've fallen short (1 John 1:9). This isn't about condemnation (Romans 8:1), but about aligning your life with the One who loves you most.\n\nTrue commitment is proven not just by feelings, but by choices that honor God—even when they're countercultural or difficult.\n\nI'm here to walk with you through this.

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns well with biblical teaching on sexuality and marriage. It correctly asserts that sexual intimacy belongs within the marriage covenant (citing Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5), emphasizes that cultural norms don’t override God’s standard, and ties the covenantal order to Christ’s relationship with the church (Ephesians 5:25-32). It also emphasizes grace, repentance, and practical next steps (seeking accountability, considering marriage, or separating until marriage) consistent with orthodox Christian pastoral care. The inclusion of Romans 12:2 and Matthew 7:13-14 adds healthy nuance about resisting worldly norms. A minor point is the phrasing around “unite what's already publicly, legally, and spiritually united,” which could be clarified to avoid potential ambiguity (the marriage covenant is the public/legal/spiritual frame in which sex belongs). Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and presents a well-rounded pastoral approach."

It maintains pastoral sensitivity by opening with gratitude, offering grace, and inviting accountability. It provides practical steps that are clear and actionable (discuss reasons for delaying marriage, decide to marry or separate, seek accountability). The balance between truth and grace is appropriate: it acknowledges the seriousness of sexual ethics while affirming God’s grace and ongoing support. Areas for improvement include greater acknowledgement of the complexities that lead to cohabitation and greater sensitivity to denominational differences, ensuring the conversation remains culturally and relationally nuanced. Overall, it is a strong, biblically grounded, pastorally oriented response."
