    "expected": "The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became human, lived a perfect life, died on the cross as a substitute for sinners, rose from the dead, and now offers salvation and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe in him. It proclaims that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, not earned by human effort, received through faith in Christ alone.",
    "output": "From the perspective of systematic theology, the gospel is not merely a piece of good advice or a moral code; it is an eschatological announcement of a historical event that fundamentally alters the reality of humanity’s relationship with God. The English word \"gospel\" is derived from the Old English *god-spell*, but the theological weight of the term comes from the Greek New Testament word **euangelion**.\n\nIn the first-century Greco-Roman world, *euangelion* referred to \"good news,\" often specifically the announcement of a military victory or the ascension of a new emperor—news that brought about a new era of peace and prosperity. Christianity appropriated this imperial terminology to declare that Jesus of Nazareth, through His life, death, and resurrection, is the true Lord and King.\n\nTo define the gospel biblically and systematically, we must look at its content, its problem, and its solution.\n\n### 1. The Biblical Framework: The \"Four Chapters\"\n\nSystematic theology often synthesizes the gospel narrative into four movements: Creation, Fall, Redemption, and Restoration.\n\n*   **Creation:** God is the transcendent Creator who made all things good. Humanity was created in the *Imago Dei* (Image of God) to enjoy communion with Him and to steward His creation. In this state, there was no shame, no death, and no separation.\n*   **The Fall:** Through the disobedience of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3), sin entered the world. This was not just a rule-breaking; it was a rebellion that corrupted human nature. The result was spiritual death, alienation from God, and the introduction of evil into the created order. As Romans 3:23 states, \"all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\"\n*   **Redemption:** This is the heart of the gospel. God, in His mercy and justice, initiated a plan of rescue to reconcile sinful humanity to Himself.\n*   **Restoration:** This is the future hope. God will one day judge the world and restore all things, eradicating evil completely and establishing a new heaven and a new earth.\n\n### 2. The Core Content: The Person and Work of Christ\n\nWhile the biblical storyline provides the context, the specific content of the gospel message centers on the finished work of Jesus Christ. The Apostle Paul provides the most succinct systematic definition in **1 Corinthians 15:1–4**:\n\n> *\"Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you... that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures...\"*\n\nHere, we see three indispensable pillars of the gospel:\n\n**A. Substitutionary Atonement (The Cross)**\nThe gospel addresses the \"bad news\" of sin. Because God is holy and just, He cannot overlook sin; the wage of sin is death (Romans 6:23). The gospel declares that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, took upon Himself human nature. He lived a sinless life (active obedience) and then died as a propitiation for our sins (passive obedience).\n*   *Propitiation* means He absorbed the wrath of God that we deserved.\n*   *Substitution* means He died in our place. As 2 Corinthians 5:21 says, \"For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\"\n\n**B. The Resurrection (The Empty Tomb)**\nThe gospel is not merely that Jesus died; it is that He rose again. The resurrection is the divine vindication of Christ. It proves that His sacrifice was sufficient to satisfy divine justice and that He has conquered death. It validates His claim to be God and secures the future resurrection of believers. Without the resurrection, Paul says, \"our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain\" (1 Cor 15:14).\n\n**C. The Lordship of Christ**\nThe gospel is a declaration that Jesus is Lord (*Kyrios*). To believe the gospel is to submit to His reign. Romans 1:4 describes Jesus as \"declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.\"\n\n### 3. The Mechanism: Grace Alone through Faith Alone\n\nSystematic theology emphasizes the *means* by which the benefits of the gospel are applied to us. This is known as *Soteriology* (the doctrine of salvation).\n\n*   **Grace:** Salvation is a gift of God’s unmerited favor. It is not based on human effort, morality, or religious qualification (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n*   **Faith and Repentance:** The appropriate response to the gospel is *faith* (trusting fully in Christ’s finished work) and *repentance* (turning away from sin and toward God). These two are inseparable sides of the same coin.\n*   **Imputation:** This is a critical theological concept. In the gospel, the sin of the believer is imputed (credited) to Christ on the cross, and the perfect righteousness of Christ is imputed (credited) to the believer. We are legally justified before God—not because we are good, but because we are clothed in the righteousness of Christ.\n\n### 4. The Scope: An Invitation and a Mandate\n\nFinally, the gospel is universal in its offer.\n*   **Whosoever will:** It is offered to every tribe, tongue, and nation (Revelation 7:9). There is no ethnic, social, or moral barrier to entering the Kingdom of God.\n*   **The Kingdom:** The gospel inaugurates the Kingdom of God on earth. While we await the final consummation, believers are called to live as \"citizens of heaven,\" embodying the values of the Kingdom—love, justice, mercy, and truth—in the present age.\n\n### Summary\n\nTo summarize systematically: The Gospel is the good news that the God of the universe, in perfect holiness and love, sent His Son to become man. Through His sinless life, substitutionary death, and victorious resurrection, Jesus satisfied the wrath of God against sin, defeated death, and secured eternal life for all who repent and believe. It is the declaration that Jesus is Lord, and that through Him, sinners are reconciled to God and restored to their intended purpose.",

            "Etymology note: The response states the gospel word comes from the Old English god-spell. A more standard rendering is gōdspel (good news) or godspel (God-spell) with the sense of 'good news' rather than implying a modern form of 'god-spell.' This is a minor, lexical/etymological clarification rather than a doctrinal error."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the answer aligns with orthodox evangelical and historic Christian teaching: the gospel as good news centered on the person and work of Christ (incarnation, substitutionary atonement, resurrection, lordship), received by grace through faith and repentance, applied via imputation of Christ’s righteousness, with a universal (offer) scope and Kingdom implications. It employs a four-chapter framework (Creation–Fall–Redemption–Restoration) and cites key biblical texts to ground its claims. The treatment is nuanced in recognizing the eschatological framing, the debtor/need (sin and wrath), and the necessity of response (faith and repentance). A minor caveat is the etymology note, which could be clarified to reflect standard scholarly forms of the word’s origin, but this does not undermine the theological or biblical core of the response."

          "explanation": "Overall, the response presents orthodox, historic Christian teaching on the gospel. It correctly emphasizes the gospel as an eschatological event, centers on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and affirms key soteriological elements: substitutionary atonement, the resurrection as vindication, and the Lordship of Christ. It also upholds grace alone through faith (with repentance) and the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, while affirming the universal offer of the gospel and the inaugurated (already/not yet) aspect of the Kingdom. In doing so, it avoids the classic heresies listed (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, etc.). Some strengths and minor areas for clarification or nuance include: an explicit Trinitarian formulation would strengthen orthodox grounding, and discussions of the kingdom/present age could benefit from explicit “already but not yet” language common in classical orthodoxy; the emphasis on imputation is a point of doctrinal variation across traditions (e.g., some see righteousness as infused rather than imputed). However, none of these constitute heresy in themselves."
