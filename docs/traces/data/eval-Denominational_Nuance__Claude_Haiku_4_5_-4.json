    "expected": "Christians hold various eschatological views: Premillennialism believes Christ returns before a literal thousand-year reign. Postmillennialism expects Christ returns after the church establishes God's kingdom on earth. Amillennialism sees the millennium as symbolic of the current church age. Within premillennialism, pretribulationists believe the rapture precedes tribulation, while post-tribulationists place it after. Preterists see many prophecies as fulfilled in 70 AD. Despite these differences, all orthodox Christians affirm Christ's personal return, final judgment, bodily resurrection, and eternal states of heaven and hell. The timing and details are disputed, but the core hope remains.",
    "output": "# Christian Views on End Times (Eschatology)\n\nThis is a rich area of theological diversity within orthodoxy. I'll outline major frameworks and their adherents.\n\n## Primary Millennial Views\n\n**Premillennialism**\n- Christ returns *before* a literal 1,000-year reign\n- Common in: Evangelical, Pentecostal, many independent churches\n- Emphasizes: Literal biblical interpretation, Christ's imminent return\n- Variation: \"Dispensationalism\" divides history into distinct periods with different divine plans\n\n**Amillennialism**\n- The \"millennium\" is symbolic, representing the current church age\n- Common in: Catholic, Orthodox, Reformed, many mainline denominations\n- Emphasizes: Spiritual fulfillment of prophecy, symbolic interpretation\n- Views Christ's reign as present and spiritual, culminating in his final return\n\n**Postmillennialism**\n- Christ returns *after* a golden age of Christian influence\n- Common in: Some Reformed, historic Protestant traditions\n- Less prominent today than historically\n- Emphasizes: Christian cultural transformation before Christ's return\n\n## Shared Convictions (Orthodox Core)\n\nDespite differences, mainstream Christian traditions affirm:\n- Christ's literal, bodily return\n- Final judgment and resurrection\n- New heavens and new earth\n- God's sovereignty over history\n\n## Other Significant Variables\n\n- **Rapture timing**: Pre-, mid-, or post-tribulation (primarily within premillennialism)\n- **Israel's role**: Literal national restoration vs. spiritual fulfillment\n- **Prophecy interpretation**: Literal vs. typological vs. symbolic\n\n## Why These Differences Persist\n\nThese aren't settled by plain reading of Scripture alone because:\n- Revelation and Daniel use highly symbolic language\n- Different biblical passages emphasize different themes\n- Interpretation involves philosophical frameworks (literal vs. symbolic)\n\nEach tradition has sophisticated theological reasoning—this isn't frivolous disagreement.",

            "Overgeneralization about Catholic/Orthodox eschatology being predominantly amillennial; Catholic and Orthodox eschatology are diverse and not uniformly classified under a single ‘amillennial’ label. The response would benefit from noting more explicitly the variety within those traditions (e.g., inaugurated/realized eschatology, symbolic readings of Revelation).",
            "Lack of explicit distinction between historic premillennialism and dispensational premillennialism; the piece treats premillennialism monolithically while dispensationalism (a subset) has specific hermeneutical and eschatological commitments that deserve separate mention.",
            "The discussion of the rapture could acknowledge that the doctrine of a separate rapture is contested across Christian traditions; not all premillennial or non-premillennial groups affirm a distinct rapture timetable, and some terminology (e.g., “rapture”) is not uniformly used or accepted.",
            "Israel’s role is presented as a binary debate (literal restoration vs. spiritual fulfillment) without noting how many traditions interpret the Israel covenant differently (e.g., as ongoing corporate Israel, as the church replacing Israel in some strands, or as a complex teleology where both national and spiritual dimensions are read in various ways)."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer does a solid job outlining the main millennial frameworks (premillennial, amillennial, postmillennial) and the common sub-views around the timing of the rapture, the interpretation of Revelation, and the role of Israel. It also rightly notes that Revelation and Daniel include symbolic language and that there is a diversity of hermeneutical approaches. However, there are a few caveats that affect precision and nuance: (1) It net-claims Catholic/Orthodox churches are broadly amillennial, which is an overgeneralization; eschatology in those traditions is diverse, and it is better to speak of predominant tendencies rather than a uniform label. (2) It treats premillennialism as a single package, whereas historic premillennialism and dispensational premillennialism differ in important ways (especially hermeneutics, soteriology, and ecclesiology). (3) It mentions the rapture as a timing mechanism but does not acknowledge that many Christian traditions reject a separate rapture or interpret it differently; the term itself is particularly associated with dispensational premillennialism. (4) The discussion of Israel’s role could be softened by naming more nuanced positions (ongoing scholarly debate about national restoration, covenant promises, and the church’s relationship to Israel). Overall, the response is doctrinally coherent and biblically aligned in broad strokes, with room for improved precision and nuance in specific ecclesial contexts."

It consistently uses ecumenical language (e.g., 'within orthodoxy', 'Shared Convictions') and describes both literal and symbolic approaches, without endorsing a single tradition as definitive. It acknowledges varying interpretive methods and historical shifts, and includes examples from Catholic, Orthodox, Reformed, and various Protestant/evangelical groups. Minor quibbles: the phrasing 'Common in' for certain groups can oversimplify intra-tradition variation, but does not amount to a denominational endorsement."
