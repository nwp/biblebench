    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of whether unbelievers will experience eternal conscious torment (ECT) is one of the most debated topics in Christian theology. Different perspectives exist based on how theologians interpret specific biblical texts, the nature of God’s justice, and the meaning of \"eternal life\" and \"death.\"\n\nHere are the three primary viewpoints held by various Christian denominations and scholars:\n\n### 1. Eternal Conscious Torment (Traditional View)\nThis has been the majority view within the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestant traditions for centuries.\n*   **The Concept:** It teaches that those who reject God will spend eternity in hell, experiencing physical and spiritual suffering without end.\n*   **Biblical Basis:** Proponents point to passages such as Matthew 25:46 (“And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life”) and Revelation 14:11 (“And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever”).\n*   **The Logic:** This view often suggests that since God is an infinite being, a sin against Him requires an infinite punishment. It also views the human soul as inherently immortal.\n\n### 2. Conditionalism / Annihilationism\nThis view has gained significant ground among evangelical scholars (such as John Stott) and is the official doctrine of groups like the Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n*   **The Concept:** It teaches that immortality is a gift from God through Christ; therefore, the soul is not inherently immortal. Those who reject God are eventually destroyed (annihilated) after a period of judgment. They cease to exist rather than suffering forever.\n*   **Biblical Basis:** Proponents focus on verses that describe the fate of the wicked as \"perishing\" or \"destruction\" (John 3:16; Matthew 10:28), and the \"second death\" (Revelation 20:14).\n*   **The Logic:** Annihilationists argue that \"eternal punishment\" refers to a punishment with eternal *consequences* (permanent death), not an eternal *process* of punishing. They argue that a God of perfect love and justice would not torture beings infinitely for finite sins.\n\n### 3. Christian Universalism (Universal Restoration)\nThis view was present in the early church (associated with figures like Origen and Gregory of Nyssa) and has seen a modern resurgence.\n*   **The Concept:** It teaches that hell is \"remedial\" or \"purgatorial\" rather than purely punitive. The goal of hell is to bring the person to repentance, and eventually, through Christ, all of humanity will be reconciled to God.\n*   **Biblical Basis:** Proponents look to verses such as 1 Corinthians 15:22 (“as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive”) and Colossians 1:20 (“through him to reconcile to himself all things”).\n*   **The Logic:** This view emphasizes God’s sovereignty and love, arguing that if God desires all to be saved, He will eventually succeed. They argue the Greek word *aionios* (often translated as \"eternal\") refers to an \"age\" or a specific duration of time, not necessarily infinity.\n\n### Summary of Differences\nThe debate often hinges on three things:\n1.  **Translation:** Does \"eternal\" (*aionios*) mean \"never-ending time\" or \"of the age to come\"?\n2.  **The Nature of the Soul:** Is the soul naturally immortal, or must God grant it immortality?\n3.  **The Nature of Justice:** Does justice require an unending penalty, or is the total loss of life the \"ultimate\" penalty?\n\nBecause these perspectives rely on different interpretations of the same scriptures, there is no single consensus among all believers. Individual denominations often take a firm stance on one of these views as part of their statement of faith.",
