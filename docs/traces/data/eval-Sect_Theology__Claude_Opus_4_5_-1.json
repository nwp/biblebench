    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "# Theological Analysis: Latter-day Saint vs. Historic Christian Trinitarianism\n\n## The Claim Being Examined\n\nThe person affirms belief in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit using LDS scriptures (Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants, Pearl of Great Price) alongside the Bible. This requires careful examination because **the same terminology carries substantially different meanings**.\n\n---\n\n## Key Areas of Departure\n\n### 1. **The Nature of the Godhead**\n\n| Historic Christian Orthodoxy | Latter-day Saint Teaching |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| One God in three co-eternal, co-equal Persons sharing one divine essence (*ousia*) | Three separate divine beings, unified in purpose but ontologically distinct |\n| God is spirit, without body (John 4:24) | \"The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's\" (D&C 130:22) |\n| Trinity defined at Nicaea (325), Constantinople (381) | These creeds are rejected as products of apostasy |\n\n**D&C 130:22** explicitly states the Father and Son have \"bodies of flesh and bones,\" while the Holy Ghost is \"a personage of Spirit\"—making them three separate beings rather than one Being.\n\n### 2. **Divine Ontology (What God Is)**\n\nHistoric Christianity holds that God is:\n- *A se* (self-existent)\n- Eternal, uncreated\n- Ontologically distinct from creation\n\nLDS theology teaches:\n- God the Father was once a man who progressed to godhood (King Follett Discourse, Joseph Smith)\n- Humans can achieve exaltation/godhood (\"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be\")\n- Matter is eternal; God organized rather than created *ex nihilo*\n\nThis represents a fundamental departure regarding **the Creator/creature distinction** central to historic theism.\n\n### 3. **The Person of Christ**\n\nBoth traditions affirm Jesus as divine, Savior, and resurrected Lord. However:\n\n- **Historic teaching**: The Son is eternally begotten, sharing fully in the divine nature, the eternal *Logos* (John 1:1)\n- **LDS teaching**: Jesus is the \"firstborn\" spirit child of Heavenly Father, spirit-brother to all humans (including Lucifer), who achieved his divine status\n\n---\n\n## Areas of Apparent Agreement (with caveats)\n\nThe **Book of Mormon itself** contains passages that sound quite trinitarian:\n- \"Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are **one God**\" (2 Nephi 31:21, Alma 11:44)\n- These earlier texts use language closer to historic Christianity\n\nHowever, later LDS revelations (particularly D&C and Joseph Smith's Nauvoo-era teachings) moved toward explicit tritheism, which LDS theology harmonizes through the concept of \"progressive revelation.\"\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters Theologically\n\nHistoric Christianity (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant) considers the Nicene understanding of the Trinity a **non-negotiable boundary** of orthodoxy because:\n\n1. It preserves monotheism while affirming Christ's full deity\n2. It grounds salvation—only an infinite God can offer infinite atonement\n3. It reflects the biblical witness as understood by the early Church\n\nThe LDS view, while using Christian vocabulary, operates within a different metaphysical framework—one where divinity is **achievable** rather than **exclusive** to the one eternal God.\n\n---\n\n## Respectful Conclusion\n\nLatter-day Saints sincerely worship the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and seek to follow Jesus Christ. However, theological honesty requires acknowledging that **LDS teaching constitutes a distinct theological system** rather than a variant of Nicene Christianity. The differences are not minor or merely semantic—they concern the very nature of God, creation, and human destiny.\n\nThis is why most historic Christian bodies do not recognize LDS baptism as trinitarian, despite the shared formula—the words refer to different concepts.",

            "The statement that John 4:24 defines God as having no body is a common traditional reading in historic Christianity, but LDS theology explicitly teaches that the Father has a tangible body (D&C 130:22–23) while still using John 4:24 to emphasize God's spiritual nature. This oversimplifies the Bible’s and early Christian debate about the Godhead and how divine embodiment is treated in different theologies.",
            "Some wording could mislead readers about the Book of Mormon’s own stance on the Godhead by implying it consistently aligns with orthodox Trinity language in key verses (e.g., 2 Nephi 31:21, Alma 11:44). In LDS teaching these verses are understood within a larger framework of later revelations that reframe or clarify how the Godhead relates, which is a nuanced point not fully captured here.",
            "The claim that historic Christianity closed the canon in the 4th century is broadly traditional but oversimplified. Catholic and Orthodox canons include the Deuterocanon/Apocrypha; Protestant canon is typically viewed as closed, but the historical development and authority of canon is more complex than a single date claim."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly outlines major doctrinal differences (Godhead as three beings vs. Trinity, Godhood, pre-mortal existence, and the LDS scriptural canon) and notes the nuance of progressive revelation. It is largely aligned with historic orthodoxy and the LDS position, and it cites appropriate scriptures (both biblical and LDS) to ground its points. The main areas for caution are nuanced biblical interpretation (God’s embodied nature in LDS teaching vs. classical Trinitarian anthropology, and how Book of Mormon verses are read within LDS theology) and a simplified treatment of the canon issue that could gloss over the LDS/Protestant/Catholic/Orthodox distinctions more than is ideal for a careful comparison."
