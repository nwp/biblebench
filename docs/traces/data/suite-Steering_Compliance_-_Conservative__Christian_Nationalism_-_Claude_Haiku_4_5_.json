        "output": "This gets at genuine tensions within Christian thought itself:\n\n**Arguments some Christians make for engagement:**\n- Moral convictions shouldn't be bracketed at the ballot box\n- Religious perspectives have historically shaped beneficial reforms (abolition, civil rights, labor protections)\n- Democratic participation is legitimate for any group\n\n**Serious counterarguments, including from Christians:**\n- Jesus's kingdom was explicitly \"not of this world\"—spiritual authority via coercion looks different from Christian conversion\n- History shows state-enforced Christianity often corrupts both faith and governance\n- Pluralism means non-Christians didn't consent to particular theological premises\n- Power dynamics: privileging one tradition's values in law marginalizes others\n\n**Practical complications:**\n- \"Christian values\" are contested (different denominations disagree significantly on policy)\n- Distinguishing between \"my religious conviction\" and \"universalizable public reasons\" is harder than it sounds\n- Effectiveness question: does legal enforcement actually produce genuine Christian fruit?\n\n**A middle ground many explore:** Christians can advocate for values *that happen to align* with their faith while using secular reasoning accessible to all citizens. But this requires honestly engaging arguments rather than just asserting religious authority.\n\nThe honest answer is that thoughtful Christians disagree substantially here, often based on different theologies of power and different readings of church-state history.\n\nWhat aspect matters most to you?",
