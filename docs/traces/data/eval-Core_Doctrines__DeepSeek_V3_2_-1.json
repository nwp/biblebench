    "expected": "The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is one person with two complete and distinct natures: fully God and fully human. These two natures are united without mixture, confusion, separation, or division. Jesus is not partly God and partly human, but wholly God and wholly human simultaneously.",
    "output": "Of course. As a systematic theologian, I am pleased to provide a clear, biblically grounded explanation of this central Christological doctrine.\n\n### What is the Hypostatic Union?\n\nThe **Hypostatic Union** is the theological term describing the union of two distinct natures—one fully divine and one fully human—in the one person (*hypostasis*) of Jesus Christ. It is the definitive answer, formulated chiefly at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD), to the question: \"Who is Jesus Christ?\" The doctrine affirms that Jesus is not a divided or split person, nor a hybrid mixture, but one integrated person possessing two complete and unmixed natures.\n\nThe classic definition from Chalcedon states that Christ is:\n\n> \"...to be acknowledged in **two natures**, **inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably**; the distinction of natures being by no means taken away by the union, but rather the property of each nature being preserved, and concurring in **one Person** (*prosopon*) and one **Hypostasis**, not parted or divided into two persons, but one and the same Son, and only begotten, God the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ...\"\n\nLet's break down the key components:\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Two Natures (*Physeis*)\n*   **Full Deity:** Jesus Christ is eternally God, the Second Person of the Trinity (John 1:1, \"the Word was God\"). He possesses all the divine attributes: omnipotence, omniscience, eternality, etc. (Colossians 2:9, \"in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily\").\n*   **Full Humanity:** Jesus Christ became truly human, \"born of a woman\" (Galatians 4:4). He possessed a human body, soul, mind, and will. He experienced growth, hunger, thirst, sorrow, and death (Hebrews 2:17, \"he had to be made like his brothers in every respect\").\n\n### 2. The One Person (*Hypostasis/Prosopon*)\n*   The subject of the incarnation is not a human person who became God, but the eternal **Logos** (Word) of God who **assumed** a human nature. There is only one \"who,\" one center of consciousness and identity: Jesus of Nazareth. This one person is the object of worship and faith.\n*   Scripture never speaks of \"the human Jesus\" and \"the divine Jesus\" as separate actors. All actions and sayings are attributed to the single person, Jesus Christ.\n\n### 3. The Four Key Adverbs (How the Natures Relate)\nThe Chalcedonian Definition uses four negative adverbs to protect the mystery:\n*   **Without confusion (*asynchytōs*):** The two natures do not blend to form a third, new kind of nature (rejecting *Eutychianism*).\n*   **Without change (*atreptōs*):** The divine nature did not change into human nature, nor the human into divine. Each remains what it is.\n*   **Without division (*adiairetōs*):** The natures are not separated or detached from each other. Christ is not sometimes human and sometimes divine.\n*   **Without separation (*achōristōs*):** The union is permanent. From the moment of conception, the human and divine natures are forever united in the one person.\n\n---\n\n### Biblical Grounding\nThe doctrine synthesizes the full biblical witness:\n\n*   **Unity of Person:** \"I and the Father are one.\" (John 10:30) // \"The Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\" (Matthew 8:20). The divine \"I\" and the human \"Son of Man\" are the same person.\n*   **Two Natures in Action:**\n    *   Divine: \"He said to the paralyzed man, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.'\" (Mark 2:5 – claiming divine prerogative).\n    *   Human: \"Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, sat down beside the well.\" (John 4:6).\n    *   Both in one event: \"The Lord of glory\" (divine title) \"was crucified\" (human experience) (1 Corinthians 2:8).\n\n### Theological Significance & Implications\n1.  **True Mediation:** Only one who is both fully God and fully human can reconcile God and humanity (1 Timothy 2:5).\n2.  **Effective Atonement:** To offer a sacrifice for humans, the priest must be human. For that sacrifice to have infinite worth to cover all sin, the priest must be God (Hebrews 9:14).\n3.  **Model for Salvation:** He redeems what he assumes. By taking on full humanity, he sanctifies and raises human nature itself.\n4.  **Devotional Object:** We worship *the person*, Jesus Christ, who is worthy of worship because he is God, and who sympathetically understands us because he is human (Hebrews 4:15).\n\nIn summary, the **Hypostatic Union** is the non-negotiable foundation of orthodox Christian faith. It affirms that **Jesus Christ is one person, the divine Son, who possesses two complete natures—divine and human—united without mixture, change, division, or separation.** This mystery preserves the biblical portrait of Jesus as both the world's divine Savior and its human brother.",

It correctly attributes the formulation to the Chalcedonian Definition while noting broader patristic roots, and it consistently emphasizes that all actions and attributes pertain to the single person Jesus Christ. The explanation aligns with key biblical texts (John 1:1; John 10:30; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 2:17; Mark 2:5; John 4:6; 1 Corinthians 2:8; 1 Timothy 2:5; Hebrews 4:15) and captures important theological nuances, such as the unity of the person and the preservation of the distinct natures. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., phrasing about the moment of union) do not amount to doctrinal errors but reflect common scholarly nuance. Overall, a robust, orthodox, and biblically grounded treatment with good attention to nuance.)"

          "explanation": "The response presents a robust, orthodox articulation of the Chalcedonian definition of the Hypostatic Union: Jesus Christ is one person (hypostasis) with two complete natures (divine and human) united without mixture, change, division, or separation. It correctly emphasizes that the incarnate Christ is to be worshiped as one person and that the divine and human natures remain distinct yet inseparably united. Biblical grounding is appropriately cited (John 10:30; John 4:6; Mark 2:5; 1 Cor 2:8; Heb 2:17; 1 Tim 2:5; Heb 9:14; Heb 4:15). It also rejects common heresies (Arianism, Modalism, Docetism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism) and explicitly notes Eutychianism as a historical error to avoid. Minor observations: there is a slight emphasis on the unity of the single person over a nuanced discussion of the persistent distinction between natures after the incarnation (the text already states the natures are preserved and united), and some phrasing (e.g., “two complete and unmixed natures” and transliterations) are technical but accurate. Overall, the analysis contains no unorthodox claims and serves as a solid summary of orthodox Christology. If desired, a brief note on the continued distinction of the two natures post-incarnation could further clarify for readers new to the topic."
