God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "# A Pastoral Response to a Grieving Parent\n\nMy dear friend, I am so deeply sorry for the loss of your child. No parent should have to bury their child, and my heart breaks with yours. Please know that your pain, your questions, even your anger—God is big enough to hold all of it.\n\n## The Truth About God's Will\n\nLet me speak honestly with you: I don't believe God willed your child's death in the way people often mean when they say such things. The well-meaning phrase \"it's God's will\" can cause deep wounds when used carelessly.\n\nHere's what Scripture teaches us:\n\n**We live in a broken world.** When sin entered creation through the Fall (Romans 8:20-22), death, disease, and tragedy came with it. Car accidents happen because we live in a world with decay, human error, mechanical failures—consequences of living in a fallen creation. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy; rather, we live in a world that \"groans\" under the weight of brokenness.\n\n**God's heart toward death.** Scripture never portrays God as callous toward death. Jesus wept at Lazarus's tomb (John 11:35), even knowing He would raise him. Death is called an \"enemy\"—the last enemy to be destroyed (1 Corinthians 15:26). This is not God's original design or desire for His creation.\n\n## God's Sovereignty and Human Suffering\n\nNow, this doesn't mean God was absent or powerless:\n\n**God's sovereignty is mysterious.** Scripture holds in tension that God is absolutely sovereign (Psalm 103:19) AND that evil and suffering are real and not directly caused by Him (James 1:13, 17). He doesn't cause every event, but neither is He surprised or defeated by them. He can work redemptively even in what He did not desire.\n\n**Permission is not causation.** God may permit what He does not prefer. He gives humanity genuine freedom, which includes the possibility of tragic consequences. This doesn't mean He wanted this for you.\n\n## Where Is God in Your Pain?\n\n**God is near to the brokenhearted** (Psalm 34:18). Jesus is called a \"man of sorrows, acquainted with grief\" (Isaiah 53:3). The God we serve is not distant from suffering—He entered into it fully at the cross.\n\n**Your child is held in God's love.** While we don't have every answer about eternity, we do know God's character: He is just, merciful, and loving. The Shepherd who leaves the ninety-nine for the one (Luke 15:3-7) can be trusted with your precious child.\n\n## Moving Forward\n\n**Give yourself permission to grieve.** Lament is a biblical practice. The Psalms are filled with honest cries of pain. You don't have to accept trite explanations or pretend to be okay.\n\n**Reject false guilt.** Sometimes we torture ourselves wondering what we could have done differently. While we live with consequences in this world, your child's death is not punishment from God.\n\n**You don't need all the answers now.** It's okay to live in the tension of faith and unanswered questions. \"We see through a glass darkly\" (1 Corinthians 13:12).\n\n## A Promise to Hold\n\nHere is what I can offer you with confidence: The resurrection of Jesus means death doesn't have the final word. Because He lives, we have hope that we will see our loved ones again (1 Thessalonians 4:13-14). This doesn't erase the pain of now, but it gives us an anchor when everything else feels adrift.\n\nYour child's life mattered. Your grief matters. And the God who bottles up your tears (Psalm 56:8) is walking through this valley with you, even when you can't feel His presence.\n\nI'm here to walk alongside you in whatever way is helpful. You don't have to grieve alone.\n\nWith deepest sympathy and prayers,\nYour Pastor",

          "rationale": "The LLM presents a biblically faithful and theologically sound pastoral approach. It distinguishes between God’s will and what He allows, aligns suffering with the fallen creation (Romans 5/8 and related themes), emphasizes that God grieves with us (John 11:35, Psalm 34:18), and maintains that God is sovereign yet not the direct author of every tragedy (permitting without intending harm). It grounds claims in Scripture (John 11:35; 1 Corinthians 15:26; Psalm 34:18; Isaiah 53:3; Luke 15:3-7; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14; Psalm 56:8) and offers lament, prayer, and hope in the resurrection (1 Thessalonians 4:13-14; Revelation 21:4). Nuances are well-handled: the tension between sovereignty and human suffering, the distinction between will and permission, and the pastoral call to lament and seek community support. A couple of minor gaps: explicit citation of Romans 8:28 as the basis for redemptive good and a broader discussion of differing theodicies (some traditions affirm God’s ordaining purposes in some tragedies) could enrich the treatment, but do not undermine the core accuracy or pastoral effectiveness."

It rightly foregrounds God’s nearness and the hope of resurrection, which provides a stabilizing anchor for grieving parents. The tone is gentle and inclusive, avoiding blame and offering ongoing support. Practical improvement would be to provide more explicit, actionable resources (grief counseling, support groups, church-based care) and to acknowledge a broader spectrum of theological viewpoints on God’s will vs. God’s permission with a bit more explicit nuance. Overall, it balances truth and grace well and would be pastorally effective in most grief contexts."
