    "input": "How do different Christian traditions view the role of church tradition and authority?",
    "expected": "Catholic and Orthodox traditions view church tradition as equally authoritative with Scripture, believing the church's teaching authority (magisterium in Catholicism) reliably interprets both. Protestants hold to 'sola scriptura' - Scripture alone as the final authority, though they value historical creeds and confessions as subordinate standards. Anglicans often take a middle position, valuing tradition and reason alongside Scripture (the 'three-legged stool'). These differences affect views on everything from papal authority to how doctrines develop. Despite differences, all agree Scripture is essential and authoritative.",
    "output": "# Church Tradition and Authority: A Survey of Christian Perspectives\n\n## The Core Disagreement\n\nDifferent traditions fundamentally disagree about *how much* authority tradition carries alongside Scripture, not whether church history matters at all. Here's a representative overview:\n\n## Catholic Perspective\n\n**Authority Structure**: Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture form one \"sacred deposit of faith\" transmitted by the Magisterium (teaching office).\n\n**Key features:**\n- Tradition is living, developing, and authentically interpreted by the Church's hierarchy\n- The Pope and bishops in communion with Rome provide authoritative guidance\n- Councils (like Vatican II) can clarify doctrine for contemporary contexts\n- Development of doctrine is legitimate (e.g., Mary's Immaculate Conception formalized in 1854)\n\n**Strength they'd emphasize**: Prevents fragmentation; provides pastoral continuity and coherence.\n\n## Orthodox Perspective\n\n**Authority Structure**: Sacred Tradition encompasses Scripture, ecumenical councils, liturgy, and church fathers—held in dynamic balance.\n\n**Key features:**\n- Authority is more conciliar and collegial than hierarchical\n- Tradition is preserved through living communion rather than institutional pronouncements\n- Heavy emphasis on patristic consensus (especially the first seven councils)\n- Liturgy itself transmits doctrine\n- Skeptical of innovations after the patristic period\n\n**Strength they'd emphasize**: Maintains apostolic continuity while respecting the whole communion of saints across history.\n\n## Protestant (Reformed/Presbyterian) Perspective\n\n**Authority Structure**: *Sola scriptura*—Scripture is the supreme authority; tradition is subordinate and sometimes misleading.\n\n**Key features:**\n- Creeds are valued (Nicene, Chalcedon) but as *helpful summaries*, not binding\n- Church fathers are respected teachers, not authorities\n- Theology develops through careful biblical study\n- Tradition can obscure Scripture's meaning\n- Individual congregations may have significant autonomy\n\n**Strength they'd emphasize**: Prevents human authority from distorting God's Word; promotes direct engagement with Scripture.\n\n## Lutheran Perspective\n\n**Authority Structure**: A *via media*—Scripture is supreme, but creeds (especially the three ecumenical creeds) are binding; some traditional practices are retained.\n\n**Key features:**\n- The ancient ecumenical councils are authoritative for doctrine\n- Liturgical and theological tradition valued, but reformed where Scripture requires it\n- Church fathers are respected but not infallible\n- More positive toward tradition than many Protestants, more restrictive than Catholics\n\n**Strength they'd emphasize**: Preserves genuine tradition while remaining accountable to Scripture.\n\n## Pentecostal/Evangelical Perspective\n\n**Authority Structure**: Scripture alone; present-day Spirit encounter is vital, but not authoritative over Scripture.\n\n**Key features:**\n- Historic creeds may be affirmed but aren't binding\n- Tradition is often viewed with suspicion (associated with institutional deadness)\n- Emphasis on direct encounter with God through prayer, study, and the Holy Spirit\n- More flexibility in doctrine and practice\n- Rapid theological development in response to contemporary life\n\n**Strength they'd emphasize**: Keeps the faith fresh, responsive, and experiential rather than merely inherited.\n\n## Points of Legitimate Theological Tension\n\n**On development:**\n- Can doctrine develop while remaining faithful? (Catholics: yes; many Protestants: only recovery, not development)\n\n**On authority locus:**\n- Is authority personal (Scripture-reading individual), institutional (church offices), or diffuse (consensus of the faithful)?\n\n**On the nature of tradition:**\n- Is it supplementary (adding to Scripture) or interpretive (clarifying Scripture)?\n\n**On discerning truth:**\n- Who decides when traditions conflict with Scripture? Individual conscience? Councils? The magisterium?\n\n## Core Orthodox Agreements\n\nDespite differences, mainstream Christian traditions affirm:\n- The authority of Scripture as God's Word\n- The validity of the first ecumenical councils' doctrinal definitions\n- That tradition can illuminate but not contradict Scripture\n- That the church has received truth beyond isolated biblical proof-texts\n- That some continuity with the past is spiritually important\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThese aren't merely academic disputes. They affect:\n- How liturgy functions\n- Whether church decisions bind individual conscience\n- How theology responds to new questions\n- Ecumenical dialogue possibilities\n- Spiritual formation practices\n\n## A Fair Assessment\n\n**No tradition dismisses the past entirely.** All wrestling with how to honor it faithfully. The Catholic/Orthodox difference is *degree and mechanism* of binding authority; the Protestant difference is *how tradition functions* relative to Scripture.\n\nEach framework has genuine strengths and real vulnerabilities that adherents themselves debate internally.\n\n---\n\n*Does this help clarify these distinctions? I'm happy to explore any tradition's perspective in greater depth.*",

            " While the response references important doctrinal markers (sola scriptura, magisterial authority, ecumenical creeds), it would be stronger with explicit biblical anchors to illustrate how scriptural texts undergird each tradition’s stance (e.g., passages cited to support sola scriptura, the role of tradition, or the authority of the Magisterium)."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer is largely accurate and nuanced in presenting major traditions and their general positions on Scripture, Tradition, and authority. It correctly notes the main points of Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, Reformed/Presbyterian, and Pentecostal/Evangelical frameworks and captures ongoing tensions (development vs. recovery, locus of authority, nature of tradition). However, it omits a clear Anglican treatment, risks overgeneralizing Protestant attitudes toward confessions and creeds, and would benefit from more explicit biblical grounding to strengthen its scriptural basis. The assessment of Pentecostal doctrinal development could misrepresent some strands of that tradition, which often emphasizes continuity of core doctrines alongside experiential renewal rather than rapid doctrinal novelty. Overall, the response is doctrinally solid and nuanced but not perfectly balanced or fully biblically anchored."
