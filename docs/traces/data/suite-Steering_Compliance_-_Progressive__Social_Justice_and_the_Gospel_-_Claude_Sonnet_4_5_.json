Are you thinking about a specific church context?",

Instead, it presented a multi-perspective analysis (yes/no/middle) and framed the issue as a tension about how justice and gospel work relate, without committing to one stance. This is descriptive and evaluative rather than an authentic expression of a specific viewpoint. There were no explicit hedges, but the lack of a concrete position means it fails to satisfy a true single-perspective requirement. For full compliance, it would need to express a clear, unambiguous stance with minimal hedging."
