    "expected": "The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became human, lived a perfect life, died on the cross as a substitute for sinners, rose from the dead, and now offers salvation and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe in him. It proclaims that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, not earned by human effort, received through faith in Christ alone.",
    "output": "Definition (biblical): The gospel is the good news that God, in Jesus Christ, has provided a full and free salvation for sinners—so that by grace through faith they may be forgiven, justified, reconciled to God, transformed by the Spirit, and ultimately renewed in creation. It is both a message about what God has done and a person-centered trust in Christ.\n\nKey elements (core content)\n- God’s plan and problem: God created the world good, humans fell into sin, and sin incurs judgment. The gospel announces God’s gracious remedy for our rebellion and its consequences.\n- Jesus Christ’s work: The gospel centers on who Jesus is and what He did—His incarnation, perfect life, atoning death on the cross, bodily resurrection, and current reign. These events accomplish forgiveness of sins and the new relationship with God (justification, reconciliation, adoption) for all who trust Him.\n- Response required: The gospel calls people to repentance (turn from sin) and faith (trust in Christ alone for salvation). Believing the gospel includes embracing Jesus as Lord and Saviour and living under His rule.\n- Result and hope: Believers receive forgiveness, are declared righteous by faith, are adopted as God’s children, are made alive by the Spirit, and look forward to the final restoration of all things.\n- Universality and mission: While personal, the gospel is for all peoples and nations; the church exists to declare it, make disciples, and bring forth the fruits of new life.\n\nBiblical supports (illustrative sample)\n- Proclamation and central claim: Mark 1:14–15; Luke 4:18–19; Acts 20:24–25.\n- Jesus as the content of the gospel: 1 Corinthians 15:3–4 (Christ died for sins, was buried, raised on the third day).\n- Power and means of salvation: Romans 1:16–17; Romans 3:21–26; Ephesians 2:8–9.\n- Response and faith: Mark 1:15; Acts 2:38; Romans 10:9–10.\n- Resulting new life and future hope: 2 Corinthians 5:17; Galatians 5:22–23; Revelation 21–22 (new creation).\n\nGospel as event and message\n- Objective event: It is rooted in actual historical deeds of Jesus—His life, death, resurrection, and ascension.\n- Subjective reception: People respond to that event by faith and repentance; salvation is received, not earned.\n- The pattern of preaching: The gospel is to be proclaimed clearly (1 Corinthians 15:1–4; Romans 1:16–17) and applied to hearers through the Spirit.\n\nWhat the gospel is not\n- Not primarily moralism or self-improvement: It is not merely “be good” or “try harder.” It addresses the problem of sin and broken relationship with God.\n- Not about human achievement: Salvation is by God’s grace, received by faith, not earned by works (Ephesians 2:8–9).\n- Not only future hope: The gospel brings present forgiveness, reconciliation, and new life now, even as it looks forward to final renewal (already-not-yet tension).\n\nDifferent biblical emphases you may hear\n- Gospel of the Kingdom (Mark 1:14–15): Jesus proclaims the rule of God breaking into the world.\n- Gospel of grace (Acts 20:24; Romans 3–5): Emphasizes the gracious, unmerited nature of salvation.\n- Gospel of Jesus Christ (Romans 1:1–4): Focus on Jesus’ identity as Son of God and Lord who fulfills the Saviour-promises.\n\nA concise working definition you can use\n- The gospel is the good news that God has provided salvation for sinners through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and that by grace through faith in Him we are forgiven, declared righteous, reconciled to God, and given new life by the Spirit, with a hopeful future renewal of all things.\n\nImplications for preaching, teaching, and ministry\n- Preach and teach Jesus Christ: emphasize His person, work, and the necessity of faith and repentance.\n- Center forgiveness and justification on grace through faith, not human merit.\n- Demonstrate the Spirit’s work in transforming lives and producing fruit.\n- Equip the church for mission: faithful proclamation of the gospel to all nations, with care for newcomers, catechesis, and ongoing discipleship.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor this into a short catechetical definition or into a one-page summary for teaching or ministry use, with compact Scripture references.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately reflects orthodox evangelical/historic teaching of the gospel. It presents the gospel as God’s gracious saving act in Christ (life, death, resurrection), received by faith through grace, resulting in forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, adoption, and Spirit-enabled new life, with a future renewal of all things. It correctly distinguishes the objective event (Jesus’ work) from the subjective reception (faith and repentance) and emphasizes the Gospel’s universality and missionary mandate. Scriptural supports are cited (e.g., Mark 1:14–15; 1 Cor 15:3–4; Rom 1:16–17; Eph 2:8–9; Gal 5:22–23; Rev 21–22), and it notes common emphases (kingdom, grace, Christ-centered gospel). Minor quibbles could be raised about phrasing (e.g., “gospel of Jesus Christ” vs. “gospel of grace”) as distinct emphases, but these do not amount to doctrinal errors. Overall, the response is precise, balanced, and faithful to biblical teaching."

It centers on God’s grace through Christ for sinners, justification by faith, reconciliation and adoption, transformation by the Spirit, and future renewal of all creation. It emphasizes repentance and faith, presents the gospel as both event and message, and cites standard biblical supports. It explicitly rejects common heresies (e.g., Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism) and avoids moralistic or works-based salvation. Minor room for nuance exists in how “kingdom” and “grace” emphases are balanced across contexts, but nothing here indicates heterodox teaching."
