    "input": "What does it mean that humans are made in the image of God (imago Dei)?",
    "expected": "Being made in the image of God means humans uniquely reflect God's nature and character among creation. This includes rational thinking, moral awareness, creativity, relational capacity, and spiritual nature. While sin has marred this image, it hasn't been completely destroyed. The imago Dei gives humans inherent dignity and worth, distinguishes them from animals, and establishes the basis for human morality and purpose.",
    "output": "Short definition\n- To say humans are made in the image of God (imago Dei) is to say that God stamped human beings with a certain likeness to himself that makes them unique among creatures and grounds their dignity, moral responsibility, vocation, and capacity for relationship with God and with one another (Gen. 1:26–27).\n\nBiblical basis (key texts)\n- Genesis 1:26–27: the foundational statement that God created humanity “in our image, after our likeness.”\n- Psalm 8:3–8: highlights human dignity and rule over creation as part of God’s intent.\n- Genesis 9:6 and James 3:9: appeal to the image of God as a reason to value and not defame human life.\n- Colossians 1:15; Hebrews 1:3; 2 Corinthians 4:4: identify Christ as the true “image” of God.\n- Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18; Ephesians 4:24; Colossians 3:10: speak of believers being conformed to the image of Christ (restoration).\n\nMajor ways theologians understand the imago Dei\nThe Bible does not give a single technical definition, so theologians have emphasized complementary aspects:\n\n1. Substantive (what the image is)\n- This view locates the image in particular capacities or features of humans — reason, moral awareness, self-consciousness, language, will, or a spiritual/freely relating soul. Genesis’s account implies a qualitative likeness (not physical) to God’s spiritual, personal nature.\n\n2. Relational (who humans are)\n- The image is primarily about being persons made for relationship: with God (capable of knowing and worshiping him) and with others (community, marriage, sociality). The plurality in “Let us make man” and the creation of male and female (Gen. 1–2) are often cited here.\n\n3. Functional / vocational (what the image does)\n- The image is expressed in humanity’s role as God’s representatives or stewards over creation (the cultural mandate, Gen. 1:26–28; Psalm 8). Being God’s vice-regents means exercising wise, moral rule that reflects God’s good governance.\n\n4. Structural / holistic\n- Some combine the above: the image is a complex pattern of capacities (spirituality, rationality, morality, relationality, creativity) that together make humans persons who can represent God.\n\nWhat the image is not\n- It is not primarily a physical resemblance (God is spirit, John 4:24).\n- It should not be reduced to a single trait (e.g., intelligence) so that people who lack that trait would be dehumanized.\n- It is not identical to possession of saving faith; the image belongs to all human beings as God’s creatures (Gen. 9:6).\n\nThe effect of the Fall\n- The Fall did not erase the image of God; it distorted, marred, and disordered it. Scripture and classical theology insist the image remains in sinners (hence commands against murder, insults, etc.), but human capacities and relationships are broken (Gen. 3; Romans 1–3). Different traditions nuance this: some say certain aspects of the image are lost; others insist the image as such remains though wounded.\n\nChrist as the perfect image and the aim of restoration\n- Jesus is the perfect Image of God (Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3). Redemption aims to restore the image in believers and ultimately in all creation — becoming conformed to Christ’s image (Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 3:18; Eph. 4:24). In Eastern theology this restoration is often described in terms of “likeness” and theosis (participation in God’s life).\n\nPractical and ethical implications\n- Human dignity and equality: Because every human bears God’s image, all persons have intrinsic worth and equal moral standing (implications for race, sex, disability, age, etc.).\n- Moral accountability: Bearing God’s image includes moral responsibility and the capacity to know and do what is right (a basis for law and conscience).\n- Social ethics and public life: The imago Dei grounds care for the vulnerable, limits on taking human life (Gen. 9:6), and responsibilities for just stewardship of creation.\n- Mission and worship: Our vocation as God’s image-bearers includes worshiping God and reflecting his character in culture (creation care, art, science, justice).\n\nSummary\n- Imago Dei is a rich, multi-dimensional biblical teaching: humans are created to reflect God’s personhood, rule as his representatives, relate to him and one another, and steward creation. Sin has marred that reflection, but in Christ the image is being restored, and that fact supplies the theological foundation for human dignity, moral responsibility, and Christian hope.",

          "rationale": "The response accurately presents the imago Dei as a multi-dimensional reality: reflecting God’s personhood, relational capacity, and vocation to steward creation; it rightly grounds dignity and moral accountability in being God’s image. It correctly cites key biblical texts (Gen 1:26–27; Ps 8; Col 1:15; Heb 1:3; Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 3:18; Eph 4:24; Col 3:10; Gen 9:6; James 3:9) and notes Christ as the perfect image (Col 1:15; Heb 1:3) with ongoing restoration in believers (Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 3:18; Eph 4:24). It acknowledges Fall distortion without total annihilation of the image, aligns with historic teaching that the image remains albeit marred, and recognizes that some traditions also speak of restoration in Christ (and even theosis in Eastern thought). It outlines major interpretive approaches (substantive, relational, functional, holistic) and clarifies what the imago Dei is not. It also draws out practical implications for dignity, ethics, worship, and mission. The inclusion of multiple doctrinal hues (e.g., theosis) is nuanced, though it may not be embraced uniformly across all traditions. Overall, this response is doctrinally orthodox, biblically grounded, and nuanced. Potential area for minor improvement: a bit more explicit differentiation between “image in all humans” versus “image restored more fully in Christ” could be clarified to avoid any misreading about the scope of restoration.)"

          "explanation": "The response is orthodox overall. It presents the imago Dei as a multi-dimensional reality (substantive, relational, functional, holistic), grounded in Scripture (Gen 1:26–27; Ps 8; Gen 9:6; James 3:9; Col 1:15; Heb 1:3; 2 Cor 4:4; Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 3:18; Eph 4:24; Col 3:10). It correctly notes that the image is not physical, that the Fall distorts but does not fully erase it, and that Christ is the perfect image with believers being restored to Christ’s likeness. The mention of theosis reflects an Eastern Christian perspective rather than a necessary Protestant one, but is presented as a nuance rather than a doctrinal error. Practical implications (dignity, morality, justice, stewardship, worship) follow standard Christian teaching. No explicit heretical positions (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, etc.) are taught. Minor clarifications could include varying traditional emphases on how the image is affected by the Fall across denominations, but these are methodological rather than doctrinal errors."
