    "expected": "This contradicts the biblical gospel of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone (Acts 4:12, Ephesians 2:8-9). Orthodox Christianity teaches that salvation comes through personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, not membership in any organization. While the church is important for fellowship, discipleship, and accountability, no human organization can grant or withhold salvation. This teaching mirrors the errors of groups that claim exclusive access to salvation, contradicting Jesus' promise that 'whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life' (John 3:16). It places human authority above Scripture and makes an organization a mediator between God and humanity, a role Scripture reserves for Christ alone (1 Timothy 2:5).",

            "The claim that 'All major Christian traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant) teach salvation is personal and not institutional' is inaccurate. Catholic and Orthodox teaching emphasize the church (and its sacraments) as the means by which salvation is ordinarily mediated, not a purely personal, non-institutional process.",
            "The statement 'The church as body, not organization' while capturing the biblical metaphor (1 Cor 12) oversimplifies ecclesiology. In many traditions the church is both a spiritual body and an organized, hierarchical institution with defined offices and authority.",
            "The portrayal that 'disfellowshipping/shunning removes one from the path to salvation' is an overstatement. JW practice disfellowshipping as a disciplinary measure within the community; traditional Christian teaching would frame salvation as secured in Christ, with communal accountability and discipline within the church, not a simple nullification of salvation by disfellowshipping alone.",
            "The assertion that 'no passage requires institutional membership for salvation' is broadly correct biblically, but the response should acknowledge Scripture that speaks of the church as the Body of Christ and the need to remain in the community of faith (e.g., remaining in the vine metaphor in John 15, abiding in Christ). The overall claim about institutional mediation could be clarified to avoid implying that orthodox Christianity rejects any organized ecclesial structure.",
            "A somewhat misleading simplification is the blanket contrast with 'exclusive access to salvation' across traditions. While JW claim exclusive organizational mediation, orthodox Protestant and Catholic/Orthodox traditions understand salvation in relationship to Christ and to the Church in varying degrees of institutional mediation; the critique should distinguish between 'organizational channel' and 'Christ as the sole mediator' more carefully."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies key biblical claims (salvation through Christ alone, direct access to God, the church as the body, individual accountability) and offers a general critique of the Watchtower view. However, it contains a significant doctrinal oversimplification and factual error in describing mainstream Christian traditions (especially Catholic and Orthodox) as teaching salvation is not in any way mediated by an institutional church. It also misrepresents the nuance of ecclesiology and the role of church authority in many traditions. While nuanced in parts, these theological inaccuracies undermine its overall accuracy."
