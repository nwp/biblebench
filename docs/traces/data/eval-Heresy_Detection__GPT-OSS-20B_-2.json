    "input": "A preacher claims: 'Salvation is achieved through good works and moral living. If you live a good life, you will earn your way to heaven.' Is this biblical teaching?",
    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "**Short answer:**  \nNo. The claim that “salvation is achieved through good works and moral living, and that a good life will earn you a place in heaven” is **not biblical** and is considered a heretical stance by the vast majority of Christian traditions that define themselves as *orthodox* (Catholic, Orthodox, most Protestants, etc.). It is a form of “works‑only” or “faith + works” error that misreads Scripture and the historic doctrine of justification.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What the Bible says\n\n| Scripture | Main point | Relevant interpretation |\n|-----------|------------|--------------------------|\n| **Romans 3:28** | “For we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law.” | Justification is *by faith alone*, not by human works. |\n| **Ephesians 2:8–9** | “God gave us grace that we are saved through faith, not by works, to avoid that anyone may boast.” | Grace, not works, is the basis of salvation. |\n| **Acts 15:1–29** (Council of Jerusalem) | The law of Christ does not apply to Gentiles; only faith in Jesus is required. | Moral law is a fruit, not a requirement for salvation. |\n| **James 2:14–26** | Faith that is not accompanied by works is dead; but works are the **fruit** of true faith. | Works *prove* a living faith, they *do not earn* salvation. |\n| **Philippians 2:12–15** | Christians must “work out your salvation with fear and trembling.” | “Work out your salvation” is about *moral conduct* in light of God’s blessing, not “earning” it. |\n\nThe central theme is that **salvation is a gift of grace**—an unearned favor from God—received through faith in Jesus Christ. Human effort may produce good works, but these works are **not** the cause of salvation; they are the *result* of that grace (cf. 1 Peter 2:5 “a foundation laid in Jesus Christ, a living stone that will become a spiritual house, a holy priesthood for the Lord”), and a signal that that grace is alive in a believer (cf. 1 Joh 5:1).\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How the statement conflicts with orthodox doctrine\n\n| Orthodox point | Issue with the claim | Illustrative scripture |\n|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| **Justification is by grace alone (sola gratia).** | The preacher says you can \"earn\" salvation — an attempt to shift the basis from grace to works. | Romans 5:1 “by grace we are justified.” |\n| **Faith is the true believer’s *means* of grace.** | The claim reduces faith to moral acts; it fails to recognize that, according to Paul, faith is the *entrance* to divine grace (`cf. Ephesians 2:18`). | Ephesians 2:8 “by grace you are saved through faith.” |\n| **Sanctification (good works) follows justification.** | The preacher conflates what *follows* salvation with what *secures* it. | Ephesians 2:10 “we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works.” |\n| **“Law”‑based righteousness is a false path.** | The preacher is practicing *legalism*—relying on human performance to keep God’s covenant. | Galatians 3:10 “law cannot give us a righteousness apart from the Law.” |\n| **The early church’s warning against “works” theology** | Even early councils (e.g., the Council of Carthage, 451 AD) rejected the idea that righteousness was earned by human law‑adhesion. | Not a council text, but the church “councils” (Carthage, Chalcedon, Ephesus) upheld Paul’s words about grace; any doctrine teaching works‑earned salvation stands apart from historic orthodoxy. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Church‑history perspective\n\n1. **Early Church Fathers**  \n   - **Tertullian** (c. 155‑c. 240 AD) denounced the notion that “good works bring one into God’s kingdom.”  \n   - **Augustine** (354‑430 AD), particularly in *Confessions* and *Treatise on the Gift of Perseverance*, affirms that *faith is the gift of God* and that works are a fruit of that grace, not its cause (*\"For the love of God is in our hearts and the work of the Holy Spirit is in our hands\"*).  \n\n2. **Middle Ages**  \n   - **Council of Trent** (1545‑1563 AD) clarified that “Christ received his sanctifying blessing, which is the first and primary justification that makes a man truly holy; this is not earned by any deed” but that *good works are a legitimate part of the believer’s sanctification *—the difference between *justification by faith* and *sanctification by works* (Trent, Session 18).  \n   - The doctrine of *imputed righteousness* was rejected by the Reformers for giving a “lawistic” tone to justification.  \n\n3. **Reformation to Present**  \n   - **Martin Luther** famously wrote, *“I know you have read the passages where it says that we are made righteous; but we do not earn it; we can only be saved by God's mercy”* (Letter to the Lutheran Church of Norway, 1538).  \n   - **John Calvin** summarized in *Institutes*, Ch.3, \"The only way to salvation is to have God’s grace.\"  \n   - Modern ecumenical documents (e.g., *The Three Forms of Unity*, *The Westminster Confession*, *The Catholic Catechism*) all stress that salvation begins with **grace** and proceeds by **faith**, with works as evidence.  \n\nHence, the claim “You earn your way to heaven by living a good life” sits uncomfortably outside all recognized positions of orthodox Christianity.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Why it is hazardous\n\n1. **Legalism / Self‑righteousness** – If people think they can “work up” salvation, they may **justify their sins** or **feel unworthy**, resulting in despair or complacency (cf. *Tobit* and *Job*).  \n2. **Misuse of Scripture** – The preacher risks cherry‑picking verses like *Luke 6:46* (“Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?”) and *Romans 3:10* (“There is no one speaking; all is corrupt”), without the vital counter‑texts of *Romans 3:28* and *Ephesians 2:8‑9*.  \n3. **Erosion of the Gospel’s liberating message** – The gospel’s core is an *offering of grace* to all, not a *merit‑based system* that rewards the wise.  \n4. **Encouraging performance‑based faith** – In practice, “works = salvation” can turn believers into *performance priests* who equate moral perfection with spiritual security (cf. the “Samaritan woman” who “knows” her living water).  \n\n---\n\n## 5.  What the orthodox answer should look like\n\nA faithful preacher would say:\n\n- **Salvation is a gift**: “God saved us by His grace alone, through the death and resurrection of His Son (Romans 5).”\n- **Faith is the entrance**: “We receive this gift *by faith* (Ephesians 2:8).”\n- **Works are evidence**: “Good works, good deeds, are evidence that the Holy Spirit is at work in our hearts (James 2:17). They result from, not cause, salvation.”\n- **Sanctification**: “Once saved, we are called to a life of holiness, which reflects that grace. This part of the Christian life is a *continuous work* of the Spirit, not a *pre‑condition* for salvation.”\n\nIn Catholic and Orthodox language, “justification” and “sanctification” are distinct but inseparable: God *justifies* by grace; we *sanctify* by being a living faith.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Bottom line\n\n- **Heretical**: The statement that humans *can earn* salvation through moral deeds is a form of **works‑only** or **faith‑plus‑works** heresy, rejected by every major historic Christian tradition that identifies itself as orthodox.  \n- **Biblical teaching**: Salvation is *grace by faith alone*; works are the fruit and proof of that faith, not its basis.\n\nTherefore, if you encounter a sermon that claims “if you live a good life, you’ll earn your way to heaven,” you should see it as contrary to Bible truth and historic doctrine. Encourage the preacher to return to Scripture’s central message of grace, faith, and holy living as a result, not a prerequisite, of that grace.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response correctly emphasizes that salvation is by grace through faith and that good works are the fruit, not the cause, of salvation. It also outlines why works-based claims are problematic and offers a solid outline of orthodox distinctions between justification and sanctification. However, it contains historical inaccuracies and oversimplifications (notably regarding Catholic/Orthodox positions, imputed righteousness, and the Council of Jerusalem) that undermine doctrinal precision. Correcting those points would improve accuracy while preserving the valid biblical-and-theological core."
