    "input": "What makes a religious group that uses Christian language and claims to follow Jesus fall 'outside orthodox Christianity'? Where do we draw the line?",
    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "This is a central question for Christians and for anyone trying to sort labels like “Christian,” “heterodox,” “heretical,” or “cult.” Short answer: groups that use Christian language fall outside “orthodox Christianity” when their core claims about who God is, who Jesus is, how salvation is accomplished, and where authoritative revelation resides conflict decisively with the apostolic faith embodied in the historic creeds and the teaching of the Church through the first centuries. How that line is drawn in practice varies by tradition, but the creeds and councils of the early Church provide the long-standing benchmark.\n\nWhy the creeds matter\n- Historic orthodoxy is not a checklist of minor opinions; it is a cluster of convictions crystallized in the ecumenical creeds (Apostles’, Nicene-Constantinopolitan, Chalcedon) and in the doctrinal decisions of the early councils. Those statements were precisely responses to movements that claimed to be Christian but taught fundamentally different truths about God and Christ (e.g., Arianism, Docetism, Nestorianism, Monophysitism).  \n- For most Christians and churches, adherence to the substance of those formulations — especially regarding the Trinity and the two natures of Christ — is the minimum for being “orthodox.”\n\nCore or essential doctrines (boundaries)\nWhen a group departs on one or more of these central points, most historic churches will say it is outside orthodox Christianity:\n- The Trinity: denial that God is one Being in three persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) or denial of the full deity of the Son and Spirit. (Example: traditional Unitarianism, Jehovah’s Witnesses.)  \n- Christology: denial that Jesus is fully God and fully human, or that his divine-human person is the unique Savior (examples: Docetism, the early forms of Arianism, and modern groups that teach Jesus was a created exalted being).  \n- The atonement and resurrection: outright denial that Christ’s death and bodily resurrection are the decisive means of human salvation (if replaced by something fundamentally different).  \n- Revelation and authority: the elevation of a new scripture or a modern prophet whose revelations override or replace the Bible and apostolic teaching. Historic Christianity affirms the apostolic witness and the Bible; claiming extra-biblical, corrective revelation that supersedes apostolic faith is a decisive break. (Example: movements that treat a living founder’s writings as new scripture.)  \n- Basic soteriology: a teaching that makes salvation essentially dependent on practices or revelations outside the historic gospel by which Jesus’ death and resurrection and God’s grace are decisive — for instance, exclusive temple rituals, secret knowledge replacing faith in Christ, or an entirely works-based system that denies grace.  \n\nWhat is not decisive (matters of legitimate diversity)\nNumerous doctrines and practices vary among legitimate Christian communions; disagreement on these usually does not remove a group from the Christian fold:\n- Modes and number of sacraments (baptism by immersion vs. sprinkling; two sacraments vs. seven).  \n- Church governance (episcopal vs. presbyterian vs. congregational).  \n- Detailed theories of atonement (ransom, satisfaction, Christus Victor, penal substitution) — historic churches accept multiple models.  \n- Timing and mechanics of predestination, end-times scenarios, liturgical style, and many ethical or social teachings.  \nThese are important but not, by themselves, disqualifying.\n\nDegrees of departure\n- Heterodox: deviates on some important points but may retain many central convictions (e.g., some liberal theologies).  \n- Heretical (in the classical sense): denies one or more central doctrines defined by councils/creeds (e.g., Arianism).  \n- Schismatic: breaks ecclesial communion while often retaining orthodox doctrine.  \n- Sect/cult (sociological sense): may display authoritarian structure, social isolation, or spiritual abuse; such features can coexist with heterodox theology but sociological “cult” features don’t by themselves define orthodoxy.\n\nPractical tests you can use\nAsk how the group answers these questions:\n1. Who is Jesus? Fully God and fully human, or something else?  \n2. What is the Trinity? Does the group affirm the three-person unity of God?  \n3. How is salvation obtained? Centered on Christ’s death and resurrection and God’s grace, or on additional rituals, works, secret knowledge, or a special human mediator?  \n4. What is the authority of Scripture? Is the Bible the final norm of faith and life, or is it superseded by later revelations or a living founder?  \n5. Does the group claim a new, authoritative revelation that corrects apostolic Christianity?  \n6. How does the group relate to historic Christianity (acceptance of creeds, councils, apostolic continuity)?  \n\nExamples (brief)\n- Jehovah’s Witnesses: reject the Trinity and teach Jesus as a created being; most historic churches therefore regard them as non‑orthodox.  \n- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‑day Saints (Mormonism): adds new scripture and a different ontology of God and exaltation; most historic churches regard it outside orthodox Christianity.  \n- Mainline Protestant denominations: vary in doctrine and emphasis but generally remain within the broad bounds of historic Christianity despite internal diversity.  \n- A group that keeps Christian language but teaches a living founder’s revelations that override Scripture and core creeds is usually judged non‑orthodox.\n\nPastoral and ecumenical notes\n- Christians should be cautious and charitable in labeling. Theological judgments should be specific and fair, not polemical. Dialogue can sometimes clarify whether differences are matters of emphasis or of substance.  \n- Churches also differ in how strictly they draw boundaries. The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and many Protestant communions have overlapping but not identical lines for sacramental sharing and intercommunion.\n\nConclusion\n“Christian” as a self‑description is not decisive; content matters. Historically, the line is drawn where a group’s teaching repudiates the apostolic faith summed up in the creeds — especially on the Trinity, the person of Christ, the saving work of Christ, and the authority of apostolic revelation. Beyond that core, reasonable diversity is possible and has been part of the life of the Church. When evaluating a group, focus first on those central teachings; where they are rejected or replaced, most historic Christians will say the group lies outside orthodox Christianity.",

It correctly notes that a group can use Christian language yet fall outside orthodox Christianity if it decisively departs from core apostolic teaching or claims new revelation that supersedes Scripture. It provides practical criteria for evaluation and acknowledges legitimate diversity on non-essentials (sacraments, church governance, eschatology, etc.). The analysis is generally aligned with biblical warrant and historic orthodoxy, while noting that different traditions may vary in emphasis and that creeds serve as a traditional standard rather than an absolute universal measure for all Christians. Minor caveats: it relies on creedal criteria (which some traditions may privilege differently) and does not provide direct scriptural citations, though its framework is biblically informed."
