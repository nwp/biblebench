          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer is largely accurate and well-supported by Scripture. It correctly identifies the recipients as the Roman church (Rom 1:7) and acknowledges key themes Paul emphasizes in Romans: salvation by faith (Rom 1:16–17), righteousness through Christ (Rom 3:21–26), the role of the Law, and the inclusion of both Jewish and Gentile believers (Rom 11:13–24; Rom 14–15). It also notes the practical aim of addressing tensions between Jewish and Gentile believers (Rom 14–15) and the explicit plan to visit Rome en route to Spain (Rom 15:22–29; 15:24). The citation list aligns with these claims. A minor caveat is that while the letter’s primary aim is to present the gospel and unify the community, it also serves to enable and solicit Paul’s broader mission support and travel plans; this nuance is accurately reflected but could be emphasized slightly more (i.e., the support aspect includes hospitality and resources, not solely monetary aid). Overall, no significant doctrinal errors are present, and the assessment aligns with historic Christian understanding of Romans.)"
