        "input": "Is homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "The question of whether homosexuality is considered a sin according to the Bible is one of the most debated topics in modern Christianity. To understand the answer, one must look at specific verses, how they have been historically interpreted, and how they are viewed by different denominations today.\n\nGenerally, there are two primary schools of thought: the **Traditional (Non-Affirming)** view and the **Progressive (Affirming)** view.\n\nHere is an overview of the relevant passages and the differing interpretations.\n\n### Key Biblical Passages\nThere are a handful of verses, often referred to as \"clobber passages,\" that are central to this debate:\n\n1.  **Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13:** \"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\"\n2.  **Genesis 19 (Sodom and Gomorrah):** The story of a mob in Sodom demanding to have sex with two male visitors (angels).\n3.  **Romans 1:26–27:** The Apostle Paul writes about people giving up \"natural relations\" for \"unnatural\" ones, consumed with passion for one another, men committing \"shameless acts with men.\"\n4.  **1 Corinthians 6:9–10 and 1 Timothy 1:10:** Paul includes list of sinners who will not inherit the kingdom of God. These lists include two Greek words: *malakoi* and *arsenokoitai*.\n\n---\n\n### View 1: The Traditional (Non-Affirming) Interpretation\nMost conservative denominations (such as the Roman Catholic Church, Southern Baptist Convention, and Orthodox Judaism) teach that engaging in same-sex sexual acts is sinful.\n\n*   **Literal Interpretation:** This view holds that the prohibitions in Leviticus and the New Testament are clear, moral absolutes that apply to all generations. They argue that when the Bible speaks of same-sex acts, it universally condemns them.\n*   **Creation Mandate:** Traditionalists point to Genesis, where God creates humanity as \"male and female.\" They argue that God’s design for marriage and sexuality is exclusively between a man and a woman, and anything outside that design misses the mark (the definition of sin).\n*   **Romans 1:** This is seen as the clearest condemnation, where Paul describes same-sex acts as evidence of humanity turning away from God.\n*   **Distinction between Orientation and Action:** Many who hold this view distinguish between sexual *orientation* (attraction) and *behavior*. They often teach that having same-sex attractions is not a sin in itself, but acting on them constitutes sin.\n\n---\n\n### View 2: The Progressive (Affirming) Interpretation\nMany mainline Protestant denominations (such as the Episcopal Church, ELCA Lutherans, the UCC, and the PCUSA) and progressive scholars argue that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality as we understand it today (loving, consensual, monogamous relationships).\n\n*   **Historical Context:** Affirming scholars argue that the biblical authors had no concept of sexual orientation. In the ancient world, same-sex acts were often associated with idolatry, temple prostitution, pederasty (men with boys), or masters exploiting slaves. They argue the Bible condemns *exploitative* sex, not mutual love.\n*   **Translation Issues:**\n    *   **Leviticus:** These verses are part of the \"Holiness Code\" (which also bans eating shellfish, wearing mixed fabrics, and planting two crops in one field). Progressive Christians argue that these were ritual purity laws meant to set Israel apart from neighbors, not moral laws binding on Christians today.\n    *   **Sodom and Gomorrah:** A reference to this story in Ezekiel 16:49 states that the sin of Sodom was that they were \"arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.\" Affirming views hold that the story is about gang rape and inhospitality, not consensual relationships.\n    *   **1 Corinthians/1 Timothy:** The Greek words Paul uses are debated. *Malakoi* literally means \"soft\" and often referred to moral weakness or lack of discipline. *Arsenokoitai* is a compound word (male-bed) that is difficult to translate; affirming scholars suggest it refers to economic exploitation via sex, rather than a gay relationship.\n*   **The Trajectory of Scripture:** Affirming Christians emphasize Jesus’ greatest commandments: to love God and love your neighbor. They argue that if a relationship produces \"good fruit\" (love, joy, peace, patience), it is blessed by God, regardless of gender.\n\n---\n\n### What Did Jesus Say?\nIt is often noted that Jesus never explicitly mentioned homosexuality in the Gospels.\n*   **Traditionalists** argue that Jesus affirmed the Old Testament law and explicitly defined marriage as between a man and a woman in Matthew 19.\n*   **Progressives** argue that his silence on the specific topic, combined with his frequent outreach to societal outcasts, suggests that condemning same-sex relationships was not a priority of his ministry.\n\n### Conclusion\nIs homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?\n*   **Yes**, if you interpret the text literally through the lens of traditional church history and view the prohibitions as universal moral laws.\n*   **No**, if you interpret the text through the lens of historical context, believing the authors were condemning specific exploitative practices rather than modern, covenantal same-sex relationships.",
