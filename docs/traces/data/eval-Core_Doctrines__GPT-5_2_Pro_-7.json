    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "## 1) Definition\n\nThe **resurrection of the body** is the Christian doctrine that, at the end of this age, **God will raise the dead bodily**—restoring and transforming human life so that persons live again as **embodied** creatures, no longer subject to death and corruption. This is not merely the “immortality of the soul,” but the **renewal of the whole human person**, body and soul, in a redeemed creation.\n\nThe classic confession appears in the creeds: **“I believe…in the resurrection of the body”** (Apostles’ Creed) / “resurrection of the dead” (Nicene Creed).\n\n## 2) Biblical foundation\n\n### a) Grounded in God’s act in Christ\nThe doctrine stands on the historical, bodily resurrection of Jesus:\n- Jesus rose with a real body: he could be touched and ate food (Luke 24:39–43; John 20:27).\n- His tomb was empty (Matt. 28:5–7), and the apostles proclaim this as the center of the gospel (Acts 2:24–32).\n\nChrist’s resurrection is **prototype and guarantee** of ours:\n- “Christ has been raised… the **firstfruits** of those who have fallen asleep” (1 Cor. 15:20–23).\n- God “will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit” (Rom. 8:11).\n\n### b) Explicit New Testament teaching\n- A future resurrection of all: “An hour is coming when **all who are in the tombs** will hear his voice and come out” (John 5:28–29).\n- Believers’ bodies will be transformed: Christ “will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body” (Phil. 3:20–21).\n- The dead in Christ will rise at Christ’s return (1 Thess. 4:13–17).\n- Paul’s extended defense: **1 Corinthians 15** insists that if there is no resurrection of the dead, Christian faith collapses (1 Cor. 15:12–19), and it describes the transformed, glorified body (1 Cor. 15:42–54).\n\n### c) Old Testament anticipation\nWhile the Old Testament unfolds this hope gradually, it does testify to resurrection:\n- “Many of those who sleep in the dust… shall awake” (Dan. 12:2).\n- “Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise” (Isa. 26:19).\n- Job’s hope is often read in this direction (Job 19:25–27).\n- Ezekiel 37 (the valley of dry bones) is primarily about Israel’s restoration, yet it powerfully images God’s life-giving power over death.\n\n## 3) What “resurrection of the body” means (and does not mean)\n\n### a) It is not reincarnation\nResurrection is not an endless cycle of new earthly lives. Scripture presents a linear history: “It is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment” (Heb. 9:27).\n\n### b) It is not merely “life after death” as a disembodied spirit\nThe Bible does teach conscious fellowship with Christ after death (often called the **intermediate state**):\n- To die is to be “with Christ” (Phil. 1:23; cf. 2 Cor. 5:8).\nBut this is not the final goal. The final hope is **bodily resurrection** and a renewed creation (Rom. 8:18–25; Rev. 21:1–5).\n\n### c) Continuity and transformation\nResurrection involves **real continuity** with the person who died, yet also **radical transformation**:\n- Continuity: Jesus is the same Jesus (recognized, bears wounds, yet glorified) (John 20:24–29).\n- Transformation: our bodies are raised “imperishable… in glory… in power” (1 Cor. 15:42–43).\n\nWhen Paul speaks of a “spiritual body” (1 Cor. 15:44), he does **not** mean an immaterial body. He means a body **animated and empowered by the Holy Spirit**, no longer governed by sin, decay, and death.\n\n### d) A resurrection to life and a resurrection to judgment\nScripture teaches a universal resurrection:\n- “Resurrection of life” and “resurrection of judgment” (John 5:29).\n- “A resurrection of both the just and the unjust” (Acts 24:15).\nThe difference is not whether one is raised bodily, but the outcome: communion with God or final judgment (Matt. 25:31–46; Rev. 20:11–15).\n\n## 4) When it happens and how it relates to Christ’s return\n\nThe New Testament consistently connects bodily resurrection with the **return of Christ** and the **consummation**:\n- “At his coming” those who belong to Christ will be raised (1 Cor. 15:23).\n- The dead are raised and the living are transformed (1 Cor. 15:51–52).\n- This coincides with the final defeat of death: “The last enemy to be destroyed is death” (1 Cor. 15:26), fulfilled when “death is swallowed up in victory” (1 Cor. 15:54; cf. Rev. 21:4).\n\n## 5) Why the doctrine matters\n\n1. **Creation and the body are good.** God made humans embodied (Gen. 1:26–31). Salvation does not discard creation but redeems it (Rom. 8:21).\n2. **Redemption is complete.** God saves the whole person; the body is not a disposable shell (1 Cor. 6:13–14, 19–20).\n3. **Christian hope is concrete.** The end is not escape from the world but **new creation**—resurrected life with God in a renewed heavens and earth (Rev. 21–22).\n4. **Ethics and perseverance.** Paul ends his resurrection chapter with embodied, practical exhortation: because resurrection is true, “your labor is not in vain” (1 Cor. 15:58).\n\nIn sum: the resurrection of the body is the promise that, because Jesus truly rose, God will finally raise and transform human bodies—bringing believers into imperishable life with Christ in the renewed creation, and raising all people for God’s final, righteous judgment.",

          "rationale": "The LLM's response accurately articulates the doctrine of the resurrection of the body as a bodily, transformed resurrection tied to Christ’s return. It rightly emphasizes that this is not mere immortality of the soul, grounds the claim in biblical data (Jesus’ bodily resurrection; 1 Corinthians 15; Romans 8:11; 1 Thessalonians 4; John 5:28–29; Philippians 3:21), and traces this hope through both Testaments (Daniel 12:2; Isaiah 26:19; Job; Ezekiel 37). It acknowledges the continuity between the person and their risen body, while affirming radical transformation (perishable to imperishable, glory, power), and it explains the distinction between the intermediate state and the final resurrection. The treatise also maintains orthodox creedal reception (Apostles’ and Nicene Creed language), rejects reincarnation, and connects the resurrection to eschatology—new creation and final judgment. It consistently differentiates personal continuity from the body’s post-resurrection change and links the resurrection to the larger biblical storyline (creation, redemption, new creation). Subtle enhancements could include a more explicit treatment of the exact Pauline terminology on soma pneumatikos vs. soma sarkikos using Greek terms, and a tighter delineation of the intermediate state versus final resurrection, but these are nuanced scholarly points rather than doctrinal errors. Overall, the answer is biblically grounded, theologically sound, and nuanced."

          "explanation": "The response presents an orthodox, well-supported treatment of the resurrection of the body. It aligns with historic creedal confessions (Apostles’ Creed, Nicene Creed), and with New Testament teaching (Jesus’ bodily resurrection, 1 Cor 15, Rom 8:11, John 5:28–29, Phil 3:20–21, 1 Thess 4:13–17). It rejects rival views (reincarnation, mere disembodied immortality) and affirms both continuity with the person and transformative glorification of the body, as well as a final judgment and the healing of creation. It distinguishes the intermediate state (conscious fellowship with Christ after death) from the ultimate bodily resurrection, and it cites OT anticipation (Dan 12:2; Isa 26:19; Ezekiel 37) in a way consistent with common interpretation. No explicit support is given to Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, or other listed heresies. Potential minor clarifications could include nuanced interpretive options on intermediate state timings and eschatological sequences (the exact order of resurrection, rapture, and final judgment varies among traditions), but these do not constitute heresy in the content as presented."
