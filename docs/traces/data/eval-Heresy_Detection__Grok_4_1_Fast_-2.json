    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "**Classification: Heresy (specifically, a form of works-righteousness akin to Pelagianism).**\n\n### Biblical Analysis\nThis claim directly contradicts core New Testament teachings on salvation:\n\n- **Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV)**: \"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\" Salvation is a *gift* received by faith, explicitly *not* earned by human effort. The preacher's statement inverts this, making works the cause rather than the fruit of salvation.\n  \n- **Romans 3:20, 28**: \"Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight... Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.\" Paul repeatedly rejects \"earning\" righteousness through moral living (e.g., Romans 4:1-5, Galatians 2:16, Titus 3:5).\n\n- **James 2:14-26** is often misused to support works-salvation, but James argues that genuine *faith* produces works as evidence, not that works merit salvation. Abraham was \"justified by faith\" (Genesis 15:6, Romans 4:3) *before* his works in Genesis 22.\n\nThe Bible uniformly teaches salvation as God's gracious initiative (John 1:12-13; 6:44), with human works as a response enabled by grace (Ephesians 2:10), not the mechanism.\n\n### Historical and Doctrinal Context\n- **Early Church Condemnations**:\n  - **Pelagianism (5th century)**: Pelagius taught that humans, by free will and moral effort, could achieve sinless perfection and thus merit heaven without special divine grace. Condemned as heresy at the Council of Carthage (418 AD) and Council of Ephesus (431 AD) under Augustine's influence. The preacher's claim mirrors this: salvation \"achieved through good works,\" implying human sufficiency.\n  - **Semi-Pelagianism**: A milder variant (grace assists, but human effort initiates). Rejected at the Second Council of Orange (529 AD), affirming total human depravity and monergistic grace (God alone regenerates).\n\n- **Reformation Consensus**: Protestant confessions (e.g., Westminster Confession, 1646; Augsburg Confession, 1530) uphold *sola fide* and *sola gratia*. Even Roman Catholic doctrine at the Council of Trent (1545-1563, Session 6) anathematizes pure works-righteousness, stating justification begins with grace-infused faith, though it allows cooperative merit (a point of Catholic-Protestant dispute, but not \"earning by good living alone\").\n\n- **Eastern Orthodox View**: Salvation (*theosis*) is by grace through faith and sacraments, with works as synergy (cooperation with grace), but never merited independently (e.g., John Chrysostom's homilies emphasize grace preceding effort).\n\nThis teaching undermines the gospel's essence: Christ's atoning death and resurrection as the *sole* ground of justification (Romans 5:1; 1 Corinthians 1:30). It fosters pride and despair—pride for the \"good,\" despair for the flawed. Orthodox Christianity across traditions (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox) holds: We are saved *to* do good works, not *by* them.",

Catholic and Orthodox soteriology emphasize grace, transformation, and synergy (cooperation with grace) and in Catholic thought there is merit involved in salvation; in Orthodox thought theosis proceeds through grace and participation in divine life.

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly labels the preacher’s claim as heresy (Pelagian/works-righteousness) and grounds its critique in key biblical texts (Eph 2:8-9; Rom 3:20, 28; James 2:14-26; Gen 15:6; Rom 4:3; John 1:12-13; 6:44). It also provides solid historical context (Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, Reformation, Trent, Orthodox perspectives) and accurately notes that salvation is by grace through faith, with works as fruit/response, not the mechanism of justification. A minor caveat is the broad/stated generalization about Catholic/Orthodox positions; nuanced differences exist, though the core claim that justification is by grace and not earned by works is broadly correct. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced regarding major theological distinctions."
