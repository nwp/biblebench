The wording could mislead readers into treating 'Matthew 23, cleansing the temple' as a single citation."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies the view as Marcionism and argues for the Orthodox unity of God across the Old and New Testaments. It affirms that God’s justice and mercy are present in both Testaments, cites appropriate biblical themes (God’s immutability/truth, Jesus affirming OT authority, Jesus’ judgment and mercy), and endorses a traditional interpretation of progressive revelation while maintaining God’s constancy. The main strength is its alignment with historic orthodoxy and biblically supported claims. A minor improvement would be precise scripture citations (e.g., temple cleansing in Matthew 21 rather than Matthew 23) to avoid potential misreferences and to sharpen the nuance on how OT and NT reveal the same divine character without contradiction."
