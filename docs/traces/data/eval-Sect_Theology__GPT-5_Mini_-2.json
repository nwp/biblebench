    "input": "An LDS member explains that salvation requires faith in Christ plus baptism, temple ordinances, and ongoing obedience. Is this the biblical gospel?",
    "expected": "This teaching conflicts with the orthodox Christian doctrine of salvation by grace through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28). While orthodox Christianity acknowledges that genuine faith produces good works and obedience (James 2:17), it teaches that salvation is received as a free gift through faith in Christ's finished work, not earned through human effort or religious rituals. The LDS concept of exaltation through temple ordinances (endowment, celestial marriage, etc.) adds requirements beyond what Scripture teaches and represents a works-based salvation system that contradicts the biblical gospel of grace.",
    "output": "Short answer\nNo — as taught by historic, orthodox Christianity the “gospel” is not faith in Christ plus a set of extra, church‑only ordinances and a works‑program. There is overlap between what an Latter‑day Saint (LDS) says and what the Bible and the historic churches teach (e.g., Christ is central; baptism and obedience matter), but mainstream Christian orthodoxy rejects adding temple ordinances and a ritual system as required in the way Latter‑day Saint theology does. There are also deeper doctrinal differences (about the person of God, grace, justification, and authority) that make the LDS formulation a significant departure from the biblical gospel as understood in historic Christianity.\n\nWhy Latter‑day Saint teaching looks similar in some ways\n- LDS teaching strongly affirms Jesus Christ as Savior and stresses the importance of faith, repentance, baptism, and holy living. Those emphases resonate with the Bible and with all orthodox Christian traditions.\n- The LDS tradition points to biblical passages that speak of baptism, obedience, and perseverance (e.g., Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; Matthew 7:21; James 2:14–26) and to the practical necessity of doing what God commands.\n\nWhere historic, orthodox Christianity agrees\n- Salvation is through Jesus Christ — his life, death, and resurrection are central and decisive (e.g., John 3:16; Romans 4; 1 Corinthians 15).\n- Faith must be more than intellectual assent; true faith issues in repentance and a transformed life (James 2:14–26).\n- Baptism is important and, in many historic traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, many Protestants), is a sacrament or ordinance through which God ordinarily works; obedience and holiness are expected of believers.\n- Christians also teach perseverance in faith and that Christians are called to obey God’s commands as the fruit of salvation.\n\nWhere the LDS formulation departs from the biblical gospel (historic orthodox critiques)\n1. Adding temple ordinances and a prescribed ritual ladder as essential requirements\n   - LDS theology holds that certain temple ordinances (endowment, sealing, baptisms for the dead, etc.) are saving or necessary for exaltation. Historic Christianity does not recognize extra‑biblical temple rites as a requirement for forgiveness or justification. These rites are not found in the New Testament as necessary conditions for saving faith, and they come from later LDS revelation (Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants, modern prophets), which orthodox churches do not accept as canonical.\n2. Justification and the nature of grace\n   - Many Protestants emphasize sola fide: justification is by grace through faith apart from works (Ephesians 2:8–9; Romans 3:28). James is read as showing that genuine faith produces works, not that works add to justification. LDS teaching is more explicitly synergistic and places strong emphasis on obedience to commandments and ordinances as part of the process of being saved and ultimately exalted — this can be read as adding human rites and achievement to what Christ already accomplished.\n   - Catholics and Orthodox also teach a cooperative model (salvation involves cooperation with grace and participation in sacraments), but within a Trinitarian, Christ‑centered sacramental framework and with the view that sacraments were instituted by Christ and mediated through the historical Church. They do not accept LDS temple rites, nor LDS claims about additional revelation changing core doctrine.\n3. The theology of God and Christ\n   - LDS conceptions of the Godhead (God the Father and Jesus and the Holy Ghost as three separate gods or three distinct embodied persons) and the doctrine of exaltation (that humans may become gods) depart from the historic creeds (Nicene/Chalcedonian) that define God as one essence in three persons and affirm Christ’s full deity and full humanity. These Christological and Trinitarian differences affect what “gospel” means and are central to whether a confession is the biblical gospel.\n4. Authority and revelation\n   - LDS claims about new scripture and ongoing prophetic revelation (and the authority of temple rites as revealed) are extra‑biblical for historic Christianity. The historic churches hold the New Testament as the normative, closed canon for doctrine and practice, so teachings that require new, binding rites revealed later are rejected.\n\nBiblical texts often cited in this debate\n- For justification by faith: Romans 3:21–28; Ephesians 2:8–9; Galatians 2:16.\n- For the necessity/importance of baptism and obedience: Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; 1 Peter 3:21; Matthew 28:18–20; James 2:14–26.\n- For exclusivity of salvation in Christ: John 14:6; Acts 4:12.\nThese texts are read differently by various traditions: Protestants use the first set to insist on faith alone (with works as fruit), Catholics/Orthodox see a cooperative, sacramental process, and LDS integrate baptism and temple ordinances within a broader revealed plan culminating in exaltation.\n\nA measured conclusion\n- If by “biblical gospel” one means the historic New Testament message that sinners are forgiven and declared righteous because of Christ’s atoning death and resurrection — received by faith and manifested in repentance and obedience — then the LDS formulation departs in important ways. The addition of unique temple ordinances, the role of post‑biblical revelation, a different doctrine of God, and an emphasis on ritual and works as necessary conditions for exaltation mean most orthodox Christians will not identify LDS teaching as the same gospel taught in the New Testament and by the historic church.\n- That said, there is common ground: devotion to Christ, the call to holiness, the importance of baptism and obedience — these are genuine points of contact that make respectful theological conversation possible.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Lay out specific New Testament passages for use in conversation with an LDS friend;\n- Compare LDS temple ordinances one‑by‑one with New Testament practice and teaching;\n- Summarize how Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions differ among themselves about baptism, sacraments, and works.",

          "rationale": "The LLM's response accurately identifies the core biblical gospel (grace through faith in Christ) and notes major LDS departures (temple ordinances, ongoing revelation, Godhead differences). It also acknowledges points of contact (faith, baptism, obedience) and offers a measured conclusion. However, it risks overgeneralizing about 'historic Christianity' as sola fide and could better reflect theCatholic/Orthodox nuance on grace, faith, and sacraments, as well as the nuanced interpretation of James 2:14–26. Overall, the answer aligns well with orthodox critiques while omitting some finer doctrinal distinctions present across traditions."
