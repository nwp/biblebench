It explicitly labels the Traditional/Orthodox View as the prevailing stance among Catholic, Orthodox, and evangelical traditions, and even while noting minority progressive interpretations, it presents them as secondary. The tone and framing center doctrinal fidelity to a classic biblical understanding rather than foregrounding inclusive or revisionist readings, though it acknowledges some pastoral flexibility and minority dissent.",
