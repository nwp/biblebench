    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "To analyze this belief accurately, we must distinguish between the vocabulary used by mainstream Christianity and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). While both traditions use terms like \"God,\" \"Father,\" \"Son,\" and \"Holy Spirit,\" the definitions behind these terms differ radically. The addition of the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price creates a theological framework that departs significantly from historic Christian orthodoxy (Nicene Christianity).\n\nHere is an analysis of how this view differs from historic Christian teaching regarding the nature of the Godhead.\n\n### 1. The Nature of God: Materialism vs. Immaterialism\n\nThe most fundamental difference lies in the physical nature of God.\n\n**Historic Christian Teaching:**\nEcumenical Christianity (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant) affirms that God is *spirit*. This is based on biblical texts such as John 4:24 (\"God is spirit\") and Luke 24:39 (\"a spirit does not have flesh and bones\"). While the Son, Jesus Christ, took on a human nature in the Incarnation (becoming fully man while remaining fully God), the Father and the Holy Spirit have no physical bodies. Historic orthodoxy teaches that God is infinite, immutable (unchanging), and simple, not composed of parts.\n\n**The LDS View (Standard Works):**\nLDS theology, derived from passages such as *Doctrine and Covenants 130:22*, explicitly rejects the idea that the Father and the Son are immaterial spirits. That verse states: *\"The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit.\"*\nFurthermore, the *Pearl of Great Price* (in the Book of Abraham) suggests that the Gods organized pre-existing matter to create the earth, rather than creating it *ex nihilo* (out of nothing). This leads to a view of God as essentially material, existing within time and space, contrasting with the orthodox view of a God who exists outside of time and space as pure Spirit.\n\n### 2. The Ontology of the Godhead: Monotheism vs. Social Trinitarianism\n\nThe term \"Trinity\" refers to the specific relationship between the three persons, but the definition of that relationship differs.\n\n**Historic Christian Teaching (The Nicene Creed):**\nHistoric Christianity is strictly monotheistic. It teaches that there is **only one Divine Being** (Essence/Substance). Within that one Being, there exist three distinct Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are co-equal, co-eternal, and consubstantial (of the same substance). The Son was \"begotten, not made,\" meaning He has always existed as God and is not a subordinate being.\n\n**The LDS View:**\nLDS theology rejects the Nicene formulation as a post-biblical corruption. Instead, it teaches a form of **Social Trinitarianism** or, more accurately, **Tritheism** (belief in three gods).\n*   **Three Distinct Beings:** The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are viewed as three distinct personages who are united in purpose, will, and mind, but not in substance.\n*   **The Godhead:** In LDS theology, the \"Godhead\" is a council of three distinct gods who work together as one.\n*   **Subordination:** While Jesus is divine, he is generally viewed as subordinate to the Father in authority. The *Book of Mormon* states in Mosiah 15:5 that the Son is \"the Father and the Son,\" which LDS theology interprets as a unity of title and will rather than a unity of metaphysical essence.\n\n### 3. The Origin and Nature of the Son: Eternal vs. Created\n\nThis relates to the concept of \"Eternal Progression,\" which is hinted at in the Standard Works but more fully developed in LDS sermons (like the King Follett Discourse).\n\n**Historic Christian Teaching:**\nJesus Christ is the Eternal Logos (Word). There was never a time when the Son did not exist. He is *homoousios* (of the same substance) with the Father—fully God, uncreated.\n\n**The LDS View:**\nLDS doctrine teaches that all humans, including Jesus, existed as \"intelligences\" or spirits before the world was created. However, the relationship between the Father and the Son is viewed differently. While Jesus is the \"Firstborn\" of the Father spiritually, the distinction is that Jesus is a separate organism from the Father. Furthermore, LDS theology posits that God the Father was once a man who progressed to become God. This implies a chain of causality where the Father had a Father, contrasting with the orthodox view of God as the \"Uncaused Cause\" or the \"Alpha and Omega\" who has no beginning.\n\n### 4. The Role of Scripture\n\n**Historic Christian Teaching:**\nThe Bible is viewed as the sole authoritative rule of faith (Sola Scriptura) in Protestantism, or the primary deposit of faith alongside Tradition in Catholicism and Orthodoxy. The canon is \"closed,\" meaning no new books can be added that carry the same authority as the Old and New Testaments.\n\n**The LDS View:**\nThe inclusion of the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price \"alongside\" the Bible presupposes the Great Apostasy—the belief that the true church and authority disappeared from the earth shortly after the apostles died. Therefore, the Bible is viewed as the word of God only \"as far as it is translated correctly\" (8th Article of Faith). The LDS Standard Works are viewed as restoring the plain and precious truths that were lost, effectively redefining Christian doctrine in a way that makes the Bible subservient to the modern revelation found in the other texts.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile the person you described affirms the *existence* of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the theological content of that affirmation is **incompatible with historic Christian orthodoxy**.\n\n*   **Orthodoxy** affirms **One God** in three persons who are **Immaterial Spirit**.\n*   **The LDS Standard Works** teach **Three distinct Gods** (united in purpose) who possess **Tangible Bodies** of flesh and bone (Father and Son).\n\nTherefore, while the terminology sounds similar to orthodox Christianity, the underlying metaphysics represents a fundamental departure from the definition of the Trinity established by the first seven Ecumenical Councils.",

            "The response risks implying LDS doctrine teaches three separate ‘gods’ in the same sense as classic Tritheism. LDS teaching speaks of three distinct beings in the Godhead who are united in purpose, not three separate gods in a philosophical sense. The phrase “three distinct gods” can overstate the LDS position; a more precise formulation is “three distinct beings united in purpose.”",
            "Some formulations about the Godhead’s ontology (three beings not of one substance) are presented as a definitive opposition to Nicene Trinitarianism. Orthodox Trinitarianism affirms one divine essence in three co-eternal persons; LDS terminology often describes three beings in one Godhead but does not consistently align with classical “not in substance” language. This nuance matters for accuracy about substance vs. personhood.",
            "The claim that Mosiah 15:5 describes the Son as “the Father and the Son” as a unity of title rather than essence is a debated interpretive point within LDS scholarship. The verse and surrounding Book of Mormon passages are not universally cited by all LDS readers as a clear defense of subordination or separation of essence; the text’s meaning is contested and varies by exegesis.",
            "The statement that “the Father was once a man who progressed to become God” (eternal progression) is a popular summary in LDS discourse but is not formal doctrine in the Standard Works. Church statements and official essays discourage treating this as a settled, doctrinal claim. It misrepresents the status of this idea within official LDS teaching today and should be carefully framed as a popular interpretation rather than an essential, codified doctrine.",
            "The assertion that the pre-Earth creation involved “organizing pre-existing matter” (as opposed to creation ex nihilo) is not uniformly explicit in LDS canon and relies on interpretation of Book of Abraham and related sources. Critics frequently state this as a contrast to orthodox creation ex nihilo, but LDS commentary emphasizes divine organizing and bringing matter into order rather than a definitive philosophical claim about matter’s pre-existence in every LDS text.",
            "The phrase “the Bible is subservient to the modern revelation” reflects LDS soteriology about canon (Great Apostasy, Restoration). While accurate to LDS belief, presenting it as an airtight, universally accepted stance within all LDS thought can oversimplify: there is significant variation in how individual members and scholars articulate how the 1830–now Standard Works relate to the Bible.",
            "Some accuracy issues in shorthand terms (e.g., “three distinct gods,” “three separate beings”) could be softened to reflect the LDS emphasis on three distinct beings united in purpose, not three separate deities in the classical sense, to avoid misrepresenting the canonical LDS position."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer correctly flags major doctrinal divergences between historic Christian orthodoxy (Nicene Trinitarianism, immaterial God, monotheism) and LDS teaching (three distinct beings in the Godhead with embodied Father and Son, continuing revelation alongside the Bible, and the LDS canon). It cites scriptural anchors (John 4:24; Luke 24:39; D&C 130:22) and summarizes the canon and restoration framework. However, it introduces some overstatements (e.g., treating LDS teaching as universally and formally three separate gods in a tritheistic sense; presenting “God was once a man” as a canonical Lutheran/Protestant doctrine rather than a widely contested/interpretive claim within LDS thought). It also glosses some textual nuances (e.g., Mosiah 15:5 interpretive debates) and could benefit from clarifying the spectrum within LDS teaching (distinct beings in the Godhead vs. three gods; official stance on eternal progression in canonical/modern sources). Overall, it is largely accurate and nuanced but could be tightened to avoid overstating LDS positions and to acknowledge ongoing scholarly/declarative diversity within LDS discourse."
