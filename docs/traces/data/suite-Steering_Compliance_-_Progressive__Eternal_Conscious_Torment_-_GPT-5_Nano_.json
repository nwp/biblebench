        "input": "Will unbelievers experience eternal conscious torment in hell?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Short answer: It depends on which religious tradition or denomination you’re asking about. Among Christians, there are several major positions about what happens to unbelievers after death, and other faiths have their own views. Here is a concise overview.\n\nChristian perspectives (major options)\n- Eternal conscious torment (ECT): The traditional view in many evangelical and Reformed circles. Unbelievers suffer conscious, endless punishment in hell. Supporters cite verses like Matthew 25:46 and various passages in Revelation and Luke 16. Critics say it raises questions about God’s justice and mercy and about whether infinite punishment fits finite sin.\n- Annihilationism/conditional immortality: The wicked are punished but do not suffer forever; they are ultimately destroyed or cease to exist, while believers receive eternal life. Proponents point to passages they interpret as destruction or dying the second death (e.g., Romans 6:23; Matthew 10:28) and argue immortality is a gift given to believers, not guaranteed for all.\n- Universalism (apocatastasis): Ultimately all beings are reconciled to God, and even the damned are restored eventually. Some modern theologians and a few church groups advocate this view, arguing for God’s love and the salvific aim of Christ. Critics worry whether it undermines justice or calls into question human free will.\n\nCatholic and Protestant nuances\n- Catholicism: Hell is real and eternal for those who die in mortal sin without repentance. The Catholic Church also teaches purgatory as a temporary purification for some souls. The emphasis is on the mystery of God’s justice and mercy, with free will a key element.\n- Mainstream Protestant variations: Some denominations (especially many evangelical and Reformed groups) lean toward ECT as the default reading of Scripture. Others (including some Anglican, Methodist, and more progressive groups) are more open to annihilationism or universalism, though they may not view those as official teachings of the church.\n\nIslamic perspective (brief)\n- The common view in traditional Sunni and Shia theology is that disbelievers face punishment in hell, often described as eternal in many interpretations. Some Islamic scholars entertain the idea that punishment can be alleviated or that certain people may eventually enter paradise, but eternal punishment is the dominant traditional view in many communities.\n\nOther religious and philosophical viewpoints\n- Hinduism and Buddhism generally emphasize karma and samsara (cycles of rebirth) rather than eternal hell. Some cosmologies include temporary hell-like realms, but these are not typically described as eternal conscious torment.\n- Secular or philosophical perspectives might frame the question in terms of justice, consequences, or psychological/ethical implications rather than a divine afterlife.\n\nWhat this means for you\n- If you’re asking about a specific tradition or text, tell me which one (e.g., Catholic, a particular Christian denomination, Islam, etc.), and I can summarize that tradition’s position and key scriptural or doctrinal arguments.\n- If you’re exploring personally, you might consider:\n  - What does your tradition say about God’s nature (justice, mercy, love)?\n  - How do they interpret key passages about hell or punishment?\n  - How do they reconcile divine justice with mercy?\n  - Is there a place for hope of restoration or annihilation of the wicked in that framework?\n\nWould you like a focused summary for a particular tradition (for example, Catholic, a specific Protestant denomination, or another faith)? Or would you prefer a side-by-side comparison of the main Christian views with key scriptures often cited?",

              "rationale": "The response does not adopt a single, explicit theological perspective as the (undefined) prompt seemed to request. Instead, it surveys multiple Christian positions (ETC, annihilationism, universalism) plus Catholic/Protestant nuances and other faiths, with hedging language (e.g., “it depends,” “critics say”) and caveats. It ends by inviting focus on a specific tradition rather than committing to one viewpoint. This constitutes description of various views rather than authentic expression of a specific stance, and it includes disclaimers that reduce compliance. Therefore, partial compliance at best, not full alignment with a single prescribed perspective."
