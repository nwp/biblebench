    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "This is a complex theological inquiry that requires discerning between **sociological** definitions (how a group behaves) and **theological** definitions (what a group believes).\n\nFrom the perspective of comparative religion and historic Christian theology, the distinction between a \"denomination\" (within the fold) and a group \"outside orthodox Christianity\" usually centers on the **Ecumenical Creeds** (specifically the Apostles’ Creed and the Nicene Creed). These documents serve as the historical \"boundary markers\" established by the early Church to define the essential parameters of the faith.\n\nHere is an analysis of where that line is drawn, focusing on the four theological distinctives where departures typically occur.\n\n### 1. The Nature of God (The Doctrine of the Trinity)\nThe most common dividing line between orthodox Christianity and groups outside of it (often religiously termed *para-Christian* groups or *heterodox movements*) is the definition of God.\n\n*   **The Orthodox Line:** Historic Christianity consists of Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. Despite their deep differences, they universally agree on the **Trinity**: One God eternally existing in three distinct persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who are co-equal and co-eternal.\n*   **The Departure:** Groups often fall outside orthodoxy by rejecting the Trinity in favor of:\n    *   **Strict Unitarianism:** Believing God is only one person (often claiming Jesus is a created being).\n    *   **Polytheism/Henotheism:** Believing the Father, Son, and Spirit are three separate gods, or that humans can evolve into gods (Theosis in orthodoxy means partaking in the *divine nature*, but never becoming a *deity* in essence; some groups cross this line by teaching ontological exaltation to godhood).\n    *   **Modalism:** Believing God plays different \"roles\" or \"modes\" at different times (Father in the OT, Son in the Gospels), rather than existing simultaneously as three persons.\n\n**Why this matters:** If the definition of God changes, the object of worship changes. To an orthodox theologian, worshipping a \"created\" Jesus is technically idolatry, even if done with sincerity.\n\n### 2. The Identity of Jesus Christ (Christology)\nThis is directly linked to the Trinity but focuses specifically on the nature of the Son.\n\n*   **The Orthodox Line:** The **Hypostatic Union**. Orthodox theology holds that Jesus is fully God (100% divine) and fully man (100% human). He is uncreated and eternal.\n*   **The Departure:**\n    *   **Arianism:** Teaching that Jesus was the first creation of God (an archangel or a lesser god) but not Almighty God himself.\n    *   **Docetism/Gnosticism:** Teaching that Jesus only *appeared* to have a physical body or that the \"Christ spirit\" descended upon the man Jesus but was not intrinsically him.\n    *   **Adoptionism:** Teaching that Jesus was a normal man adopted by God for divine service.\n\n**The \"Vocabulary vs. Dictionary\" Problem:** Many groups use orthodox *vocabulary* (calling Jesus the \"Son of God\") but use a different *dictionary* (defining \"Son of God\" as \"God's first creation\" rather than \"God by nature\"). Comparative theology requires analyzing the definition, not just the terminology.\n\n### 3. The Source of Authority (Revelation)\nWhere does the group get its truth? This is often the most visible structural difference.\n\n*   **The Orthodox Line:** While traditions disagree on the role of Church tradition, they agree that the **Biblical Canon** (the 66 books for Protestants, 73+ for Catholics/Orthodox) is the final, closed deposit of public revelation.\n*   **The Departure:**\n    *   **New Written Revelation:** Adding books that supersede or \"correct\" the Bible.\n    *   **Modern Prophets:** Elevating a living leader’s words to a level equal to or higher than Scripture.\n    *   **Esoteric Knowledge:** Claiming that the \"true\" meaning of the Bible was lost for centuries and has only been restored by the group's founder (The \"Great Apostasy\" narrative).\n\n**Fairness note:** Orthodox Christians believe God still speaks (illumination, guidance, prophecy in some circles), but they reject new *doctrinal* revelation that alters the foundational nature of the faith established in the first century.\n\n### 4. The Method of Salvation (Soteriology)\nHow is a human being made right with God?\n\n*   **The Orthodox Line:** Salvation is made possible **solely through the atoning work of Jesus Christ**. While debates exist regarding the role of works (Faith alone vs. Faith and Works), orthodox groups agree that human merit cannot bridge the gap between God and man; only Christ’s sacrifice accomplishes this.\n*   **The Departure:**\n    *   **Works-Based Merit:** A system where Jesus’s sacrifice provides a baseline resurrection, but \"true\" salvation (or exaltation) is earned through specific rituals, secret knowledge, or adherence to the group's unique regulations.\n    *   **Exclusivism based on Group Membership:** The teaching that salvation is not found in Christ generally, but only within the specific organization.\n\n### Summary: Where to draw the line?\n\nFrom a theological standpoint, the line is drawn at **The Nicene Creed (325 AD)**.\n\nIf a group claims to follow Jesus but denies the Trinity, the eternal deity of Christ, or the sufficiency of his atonement, they technically fall into the category of **heterodoxy** (different teaching) or **heresy** (choice/sectarianism) relative to historic Christianity.\n\n**A Respectful Conclusion:**\nTo label a group \"outside orthodox Christianity\" is not necessarily a judgment of their civil rights, their moral character, or the sincerity of their members. Many members of such groups display profound devotion and ethical behavior.\n\nHowever, theological honesty requires classification. If a group teaches that Jesus is a created being, or that there are many gods, they are teaching a religion that is fundamentally different from the structure of faith held by Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant believers for two millennia. They may be Christian in *culture* or *heritage*, but they are distinct from Christianity in *doctrine*.",

            "Canon precision could be improved: there are slight variations in the canonical books recognized by Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions; stating a simple “66 vs 73+” can misstate the range (and excludes note of regional canons or deuterocanon differences).",

          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer is largely aligned with historic orthodoxy and captures key doctrinal boundaries (Trinity, Christology, Scripture, and soteriology) and the sociological vs. theological distinction. However, it contains notable caveats: it treats the Nicene Creed as the sole/barrier boundary rather than recognizing the Chalcedonian emphasis on Christ’s two natures as a critical boundary for orthodox Christology; it overgeneralizes Orthodox soteriology by implying “solely” the atonement without acknowledging the traditional Orthodox emphasis on faith working through love and cooperation with grace; it provides a simplified statement about the biblical canon that glosses over canonical variations among traditions; and it lacks explicit Scriptural grounding in its citations. These issues affect precision but do not undermine the overall correct framework. The answer is solid and nuanced overall, with room for more precise boundaries and direct biblical references."
