    "expected": "The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is one person with two complete and distinct natures: fully God and fully human. These two natures are united without mixture, confusion, separation, or division. Jesus is not partly God and partly human, but wholly God and wholly human simultaneously.",
    "output": "The **hypostatic union** is the Christian doctrine that **the one Person (hypostasis) of Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, subsists in two complete natures—truly God and truly man—united in one Person without mixing or dividing the natures**.\n\nIn other words:\n\n- Jesus is **one “who”** (one divine Person: the Son).\n- He has **two “whats”** (two natures: divine and human).\n- These two natures are united **without**:\n  - **confusion or change** (the divine doesn’t become less divine; the human doesn’t become divinized),\n  - **division or separation** (not two persons acting side-by-side).\n\nThis is classically summarized by the Definition of **Chalcedon (AD 451)**: Christ is “recognized in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.”\n\n## Biblical grounding\n\n### 1) Jesus is truly God\nScripture attributes to Jesus what belongs to God alone:\n\n- **Deity and preexistence:** “In the beginning was the Word… and the Word was God” (John 1:1).\n- **Full divine fullness:** “In him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily” (Colossians 2:9).\n- **Divine identity/titles:** Thomas: “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28); see also Titus 2:13; Hebrews 1:8.\n\n### 2) Jesus is truly human\nScripture also insists that the Son genuinely became man, not merely appearing human:\n\n- **Incarnation:** “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14).\n- **Human birth and development:** born of Mary (Luke 2:7); grew in wisdom and stature (Luke 2:52).\n- **Human experiences:** hunger (Matthew 4:2), thirst (John 19:28), fatigue (John 4:6), suffering and death (Mark 15:37).\n- **True shared humanity:** “Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things” (Hebrews 2:14–17).\n\n### 3) These two truths belong to one Person\nThe New Testament does not present two subjects (one divine, one human) acting separately, but **one Lord Jesus Christ** acting with both divine and human attributes:\n\n- The same Jesus who is “in the form of God” also “was born in the likeness of men” (Philippians 2:6–8).\n- The “Son” is sent (divine mission) and is “born of woman” (true humanity) (Galatians 4:4).\n\n## What the hypostatic union does—and does not—mean\n\n### It means:\n- Jesus has **a complete divine nature** (all that it means to be God).\n- Jesus has **a complete human nature** (a real human body and a rational human soul/mind).\n- These natures are united in **one Person**, so that the actions of Christ are the actions of the one Son, expressed through either nature as appropriate.\n\n### It does not mean:\n- Jesus is a “blend” or hybrid (as if 50% God and 50% man).\n- Jesus is two persons sharing one body (a split-person Christ).\n- The divine nature suffered or changed *as divine* (God does not cease to be God), though the one Person truly suffered **in his human nature**.\n\n## Why it matters\nThe hypostatic union protects the gospel logic that Jesus is the perfect **Mediator**:\n\n- He must be **truly human** to represent us, obey in our place, and die for us (Hebrews 2:14–17).\n- He must be **truly God** for his saving work to have infinite worth and for him to reveal God perfectly (John 1:18; Colossians 2:9).\n- Thus, “There is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5)—who is also the eternal Son.\n\nIn summary: **the hypostatic union is the personal union of full deity and full humanity in the one Person of Jesus Christ.**",

          "rationale": "The response accurately articulates the hypostatic union as one person (hypostasis) with two complete natures—fully God and fully human—united without mixture, confusion, change, division, or separation. It aligns with historic orthodoxy (Chalcedonian standard) and consistently emphasizes that the divine nature does not suffer or change, while the human nature does, with the actions of Christ properly attributed to the one Person. The theology is well supported by Scripture references (John 1:1; John 1:14; Col 2:9; Phil 2:6–8; Heb 2:14–17; 1 Tim 2:5; etc.) and reflects the importance of Christ as Mediator. Nuances such as the communication of properties (actions and attributes being ascribed to Christ through either nature) are implied and reasonably conveyed, though a brief explicit explicit mention of the term communicatio idiomatis and the exact formula from Chalcedon could enhance precision. No doctrinal errors are present."

          "explanation": "The response accurately presents orthodox Chalcedonian Christology: one Person (the Son) with two complete natures (divine and human) united without confusion, change, division, or separation. It grounds the claims in key biblical texts (John 1:1, Colossians 2:9, John 1:14, Hebrews 2:14–17, Phil 2:6–8, Gal 4:4, 1 Tim 2:5) and aligns with the historic definition from Chalcedon (AD 451). It correctly notes that the divine nature does not suffer or change, while the human nature experiences suffering and death. It also clarifies that the union is personal (one hypostasis) rather than a blend or two separate persons. Minor enhancements could include explicit discussion of the two-nature/one-person terminology's ongoing theological nuances (e.g., will or cognition) found in some modern theologians, but no doctrinal errors are present in the material provided."
