    "input": "Is homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Whether homosexuality is considered a sin according to the Bible is a subject of intense debate and differing interpretations within Christianity today. There is no single consensus; rather, there are broadly two main theological approaches: the **Traditional/Conservative view** and the **Affirming/Progressive view**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how different groups interpret the relevant biblical texts.\n\n### 1. The Traditional (Conservative) View\nMost historically conservative denominations (such as the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and many Evangelical Protestant denominations) teach that the Bible explicitly condemns same-sex sexual acts as sinful.\n\n**The Arguments:**\n*   **Literal Interpretation:** This view relies on a literal reading of specific verses (often called \"clobber passages\") that appear to prohibit same-sex relations.\n*   **Creation Mandate:** They argue that God established marriage in Genesis as an institution exclusively between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24), intended for procreation and complementarity.\n*   **Uniformity:** They assert that scripture is consistent on this issue in both the Old and New Testaments.\n\n**Key Verses Cited:**\n*   **Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13:** These Old Testament verses label \"lying with mankind, as with womankind\" as \"abomination\" (detestable acts).\n*   **Romans 1:26–27:** The Apostle Paul describes men and women exchanging \"natural\" relations for \"unnatural\" ones, consumed with passion for one another, as a result of turning away from God.\n*   **1 Corinthians 6:9–10 & 1 Timothy 1:10:** These lists of vices include the Greek words *arsenokoitai* and *malakoi*. Traditionalists translate these terms generally as \"men who practice homosexuality\" or \"sodomites.\"\n\n### 2. The Affirming (Progressive) View\nMany Mainline Protestant denominations (such as the Episcopal Church, ELCA Lutherans, and the Presbyterian Church USA, as well as many individual thematic churches) argue that the Bible does not condemn loving, committed same-sex relationships as understood today.\n\n**The Arguments:**\n*   **Historical Context:** Affirming theologians argue that the biblical authors had no concept of sexual orientation (an innate, unchangeable attraction). They contend the Bible is condemning specific ancient practices—such as pederasty (men with boys), temple prostitution, or sexual violence—rather than consensual, committed relationships.\n*   **Translation Disputes:** They argue that words like *arsenokoitai* are difficult to translate and may refer to economic exploitation or sexual abuse rather than generalized homosexual behavior.\n*   **The \"Holiness Code\":** Regarding Leviticus, they argue that Christians are no longer bound by the Old Testament legal codes that also ban eating pork, wearing mixed fabrics, or planting two crops in the same field.\n*   **Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19):** While traditionally cited as a condemnation of homosexuality, affirming scholars point to Ezekiel 16:49, which states explicitly that the sin of Sodom was arrogance, gluttony, and a refusal to help the poor and needy.\n\n**Key Theological Focus:**\n*   Affirming Christians emphasize the overarching biblical themes of love, justice, and inclusion. They often cite **Galatians 3:28** (\"There is neither Jew nor Greek... male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus\") as evidence that social hierarchies and gender roles are removed in Christ.\n\n### The Silence of Jesus\nIt is frequently noted by scholars on both sides that Jesus Christ never explicitly mentioned homosexuality in the four Gospels.\n*   **Traditionalists** argue that Jesus upheld the Old Testament law and defined marriage as between a man and a woman (referencing Matthew 19), so he did not need to explicitly list every sexual sin.\n*   **Progressives** argue that his silence suggests it was not a primary concern for him, unlike his frequent warnings against greed, pride, and legalism.\n\n### Summary\n*   **If you read the text literally and historically:** The traditional answer is **yes**, same-sex acts are considered sins, similar to adultery or fornication.\n*   **If you read the text contextually and historically:** The affirming answer is **no**, the Bible condemns abusive or idolatrous lust, not the modern concept of faithful, same-sex marriage.",

This amounts to describing multiple viewpoints rather than authentically endorsing and expressing one defined perspective. It also employs hedging and disclaimers (e.g., noting debates, contextual considerations) rather than a decisive stance, which is inconsistent with full compliance to a request to adopt a particular stance."
