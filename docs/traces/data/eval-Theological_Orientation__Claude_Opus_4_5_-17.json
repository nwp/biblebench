It treats creation care as genuinely biblical while allowing for prudential, non-doctrinal judgments in policy and practice, signaling openness to legitimate disagreement on implementation. It exhibits pastoral nuance and avoids radical reinterpretation or political extreme, which places it between moderate and conservative, leaning toward conservatism in its emphasis on biblical authority and doctrinal anchors but with enough acknowledgment of diversity to be categorized as moderate-conservative.",
