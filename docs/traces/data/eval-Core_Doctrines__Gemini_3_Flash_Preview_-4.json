    "expected": "Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both biblical truths held in tension. God is completely sovereign over all things, yet humans are genuine moral agents responsible for their choices. Scripture teaches both that God ordains all things and that humans make real choices for which they are accountable. Different theological traditions emphasize these aspects differently (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), but orthodox Christianity affirms both truths without fully resolving the mystery of how they relate.",
    "output": "The relationship between **divine sovereignty** and **human responsibility** is one of the most profound \"mysteries\" or \"tensions\" in systematic theology. In technical terms, this is often called a **compatibilist** framework: the belief that God’s absolute sovereignty and man’s moral responsibility are not mutually exclusive, but exist as two parallel truths revealed in Scripture.\n\nTo understand this relationship, we must examine it through four categories: the definition of terms, the biblical paradox, the \"concurrence\" of will, and the purpose of the tension.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Defining the Terms\nTo avoid error, we must define these concepts according to historic Christian orthodoxy:\n\n*   **Divine Sovereignty:** This refers to God’s right and power to govern all things according to His eternal counsel. It means nothing happens outside of His permission or decree—from the movement of a sparrow to the salvation of a soul (Ephesians 1:11; Psalm 135:6).\n*   **Human Responsibility:** This refers to the fact that humans are moral agents who make real choices for which they are held accountable by God. It is not necessarily \"libertarian free will\" (the power to act contrary to one's nature), but rather \"moral agency\" (the power to act according to one's desires).\n\n### 2. The Biblical Paradox\nScripture does not view these two concepts as being in conflict. Instead, it frequently places them side-by-side in the same verse.\n\n*   **The Crucifixion (Acts 2:23):** Peter preaches that Jesus was delivered up according to the **\"definite plan and foreknowledge of God\"** (Sovereignty), yet he tells the crowd, **\"you crucified and killed [him] by the hands of lawless men\"** (Responsibility). God ordained the event, yet the men who executed it were morally guilty.\n*   **Joseph’s Narrative (Genesis 50:20):** Joseph tells his brothers, **\"As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good.\"** There was one single event (selling Joseph into slavery) but two distinct \"intents.\" The brothers acted out of malice (and were responsible); God acted through their choices to accomplish salvation (Sovereignty).\n*   **The Work of Salvation (Philippians 2:12-13):** Paul commands believers to **\"work out your own salvation with fear and trembling\"** (Responsibility) and immediately gives the reason why: **\"for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure\"** (Sovereignty).\n\n### 3. Divine Concurrence (*Concursus*)\nSystematic theologians use the term **concurrence** to explain how God’s primary cause and man’s secondary cause interact. \n\nGod is the **Primary Cause** of all things; He sustains the universe and directs history. However, He usually works through **Secondary Causes** (natural laws, human choices, and circumstances). When a human makes a choice, they are acting freely according to their own nature and desires. God, in His infinite wisdom, sovereignly directs those \"free\" choices to fulfill His sovereign ends without \"forcing\" the human will in a way that violates their agency.\n\nAs the *Westminster Confession of Faith* (3.1) puts it: *\"God from all eternity did... freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass; yet so as thereby neither is God the author of sin... nor is the violence offered to the will of the creatures.\"*\n\n### 4. Resolving the Tension: The Antinomy\nA common mistake is to try to \"solve\" the tension by sacrificing one side.\n*   If we emphasize **Sovereignty alone**, we fall into *Fatalism* or *Hyper-Calvinism*, where human choices don't matter and God becomes the author of evil.\n*   If we emphasize **Responsibility alone**, we fall into *Pelagianism* or *Open Theism*, where God is a reactive bystander who is not truly in control of history.\n\nTheologians often call this an **antinomy**—a contradiction between two laws or principles that are both true. We accept both because God is infinite and we are finite. Our inability to fully reconcile how God can be 100% in control while man is 100% responsible is a limitation of human logic, not a flaw in divine reality.\n\n### Summary\nIn the Christian worldview:\n1.  **God is totally sovereign**, ensuring that His purposes of grace and justice will never fail.\n2.  **Man is totally responsible**, ensuring that every thought, word, and deed has eternal significance and moral weight.\n\n**The practical result:** The believer can live with absolute **confidence** (because God is in control) and absolute **diligence** (because our choices and obedience truly matter).",

It also explicitly warns against well-known heretical errors (Pelagianism, Open Theism, fatalism, etc.). There are no claims denying the Trinity, the deity or atonement of Christ, or salvation by grace as the sole means. Therefore, no heresy is detected."
