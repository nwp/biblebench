    "input": "What does the Bible teach about homosexuality? Are homosexual relationships sinful, or is the biblical prohibition limited to exploitative contexts?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Short answer\nThe Bible contains a handful of passages that most readers assume relate to same‑sex behavior, but Christians disagree about what those passages actually prohibit. Some read them as teaching that all same‑sex sexual relationships are sinful. Others read them as condemning specific exploitative or idolatrous practices (rape, temple prostitution, pederasty, or sex grounded in power and abuse) and not committed, loving, monogamous same‑sex relationships. Which reading is persuasive depends on how one understands the original languages, historical contexts, and the overall biblical sexual ethic.\n\nWhat the key biblical texts are\n- Old Testament: Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 describe a man lying “with a male as with a woman” and prescribe punishment in the Holiness Code. Genesis 19 (Sodom and Gomorrah) is often cited (see also Ezekiel 16:49–50).\n- New Testament: Romans 1:26–27 (Paul speaks of women and men “giving up natural relations”), 1 Corinthians 6:9–10 and 1 Timothy 1:9–10 (lists of wrongdoers that include Greek terms often translated “homosexuals”).\n\nHow different Christians read these texts\n\n1) Traditional / conservative reading\n- Summary: The Bible uniformly forbids homosexual acts. The Levitical texts are taken as moral commands, and Paul’s lists are read as echoing that prohibition. The “natural” language in Romans is read to mean that same‑sex sexual activity is contrary to God’s created order (linked to the creation accounts and Jesus’ affirmation of male‑female marriage: Matthew 19:4–6).\n- Arguments used: The Old Testament law expresses God’s intent for human sexuality; Paul treats same‑sex acts alongside other sexual sins; the Greek terms in the pastoral epistles refer to consensual homosexual practice; sexual complementarity (male/female) is integral to biblical anthropology.\n\n2) Contextual / limited (exploitative) reading\n- Summary: The biblical critiques address exploitative, idolatrous, or cultic forms of same‑sex behavior (e.g., temple prostitution, pederasty, sex with prostitutes, rape) and not consensual, faithful same‑sex partnerships.\n- Arguments used:\n  - Historical context: In the ancient Near East and Greco‑Roman world same‑sex sex was often structured around pederasty, prostitution, chastity codes, and sexual dominance—contexts Scripture frequently condemns.\n  - Language and translation: Key Greek terms (e.g., arsenokoitai, malakoi) are rare and debated; they may refer to male prostitution, abusive relations, or effeminacy rather than modern categories of sexual orientation and committed same‑sex relationships.\n  - Romans 1: Paul’s argument begins with idolatry and its social consequences; many scholars read the passage as describing a range of dishonorable sexual practices tied to idolatry and social disorder rather than private, committed same‑sex love.\n  - Leviticus: Much of the Holiness Code is cultic and civil law tied to an ancient covenant; the New Testament treats some Old Testament laws as fulfilled in Christ, so their stance must be weighed hermeneutically rather than simply carried over.\n\n3) Middle / pastoral positions\n- Summary: Some Christians distinguish between orientation and action: same‑sex attraction is not itself a sin, but sexual activity outside the biblical ideal of marital fidelity (which they define as between man and woman) is disapproved. Others argue that if same‑sex couples live in lifelong monogamy mirroring the commitments of marriage, the core biblical concerns about fidelity and mutuality are satisfied and should be affirmed.\n- These views try to hold together concern for biblical authority and pastoral sensitivity to LGBTQ people.\n\nHermeneutical issues Christians debate\n- Which laws apply now (moral vs. ceremonial/civil)?\n- How to read Paul: is he addressing homosexual desire in general, or specific practices connected to idolatry, domination, or exploitation?\n- How to interpret rare Greek technical words and their translation history?\n- How does the broader scriptural witness about love, covenant, mutuality, and justice affect sexual ethics?\n\nPractical and pastoral implications\n- Churches differ widely: Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and many conservative Protestant bodies affirm a traditional prohibition; many mainline Protestant denominations and some evangelical communities now permit same‑sex marriage and ordain LGBTQ clergy.\n- Pastoral ethos: Regardless of doctrinal conclusion, the New Testament repeatedly calls Christians to love, care for, and welcome the vulnerable (e.g., Galatians 3:28, Jesus’ ministry to outsiders). Many argue for compassionate pastoral engagement even amid theological disagreement.\n- Ethical focus: Some theologians emphasize fidelity, mutual self‑giving, permanence, and consent as the underlying biblical sexual ethics—criteria some say can be met in committed same‑sex relationships.\n\nConclusion\nThere is not a single, uncontested biblical teaching that all Christians read the same way. The texts most often cited can be read as forbidding all same‑sex sexual activity, or as forbidding specific exploitative/ idolatrous forms of same‑sex practice while not speaking directly to modern, consensual, monogamous same‑sex relationships. Which conclusion one accepts depends on interpretive choices about ancient context, language, the binding force of Old Testament law, and how the Bible’s overall vision of marriage and sexual ethics should be applied today.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Walk through one of the key passages (Romans 1 or Leviticus 18) verse by verse;\n- Summarize denominational positions;\n- Suggest further reading from both conservative and progressive scholars. Which would be most helpful?",
