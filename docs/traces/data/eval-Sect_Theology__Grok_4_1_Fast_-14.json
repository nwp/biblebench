    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "### Defining Orthodox Christianity\nOrthodox Christianity, in the historical and theological sense, refers to the body of doctrine affirmed by the vast majority of Christian churches worldwide—Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant traditions—for nearly two millennia. This orthodoxy is crystallized in ancient creeds like the **Apostles' Creed** (c. 2nd-4th century), **Nicene Creed** (325/381 AD), and **Chalcedonian Definition** (451 AD), which were formulated to guard against heresies that threatened the core of the Christian faith. These documents emphasize:\n\n- **The Trinity**: One God eternally existing in three distinct persons—Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit—who are co-equal, co-eternal, and of the same substance (homoousios).\n- **Christology**: Jesus Christ is fully God and fully human, begotten (not created) by the Father from eternity, incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, who lived a sinless life, died substitutionally for sins, rose bodily from the dead, ascended to heaven, and will return to judge the living and the dead.\n- **Soteriology** (salvation): Humanity is fallen and sinful; salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit or works.\n- **Scriptural authority**: The 66 books of the Bible (Protestant canon) or 73 books (Catholic/Orthodox canon) as the inspired, infallible Word of God, sufficient for faith and practice, without additional authoritative scriptures.\n\nThese are not arbitrary; they derive from apostolic teaching as recorded in Scripture (e.g., the gospel summary in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4; Jesus' claims in John 1:1-14, 8:58, 10:30; Trinitarian baptismal formula in Matthew 28:19).\n\n### Criteria for Falling \"Outside\" Orthodox Christianity\nA group using Christian language (e.g., \"Jesus is Savior,\" \"follow the Bible\") and claiming to follow Jesus departs from orthodoxy when it **fundamentally denies or redefines one or more core doctrines** above, even if it affirms others. This isn't about minor disagreements (e.g., church government, baptism mode, or worship styles), which allow for diversity within orthodoxy (e.g., infant vs. believer's baptism). The \"line\" is drawn at **essential doctrines** that define the gospel itself—what the early church called the *kerygma* (proclaimed message) and later theologians termed the *analogy of faith* (Scripture interpreting Scripture).\n\nKey departures include:\n\n1. **Rejection of the Trinity or Deity of Christ**:\n   - **Why essential?** The Trinity and Christ's full divinity are non-negotiable (John 1:1; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:3). Denying them undermines the Incarnation and atonement—only God can atone for infinite sin.\n   - **Examples**:\n     | Group | Teaching | Relation to Orthodoxy |\n     |-------|----------|-----------------------|\n     | Jehovah's Witnesses | Jesus is a created being (Michael the Archangel); God is a solitary person (Jehovah); Holy Spirit is an impersonal force. Uses altered New World Translation Bible. | Major departure: Arianism-like heresy (condemned at Nicaea). Affirms Jesus' role but denies His eternal deity. |\n     | Oneness Pentecostals | God is one person manifesting in modes (Father, Son, Spirit); Jesus is the Father incarnate. | Modalism (condemned early); rejects distinct persons. |\n     | The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) | Godhead is three separate gods; Father has a physical body and progressed to godhood; Jesus is a created spirit-child of God. Additional scriptures (Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants). | Polytheism and eternal progression contradict monotheism (Isaiah 43:10; 44:6). |\n\n2. **Altered View of Salvation**:\n   - **Why essential?** Salvation must be by grace through faith in Christ's finished work (Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:24).\n   - **Examples**: Some groups (e.g., certain Word-Faith teachings) emphasize works, prosperity, or temple ordinances as co-equal to faith, departing from sola gratia (grace alone).\n\n3. **Additional or Superseding Scriptures**:\n   - **Why essential?** The Bible is closed canon (Revelation 22:18-19; no new revelation altering core doctrines).\n   - **Examples**: Mormons' ongoing revelation via prophets redefines God and Christ.\n\n4. **Other Core Denials**:\n   - Denial of bodily resurrection (e.g., some liberal theologies reduce it to spiritual metaphor).\n   - Rejection of substitutionary atonement (e.g., penal substitution where Christ bears God's wrath).\n\n### Where Do We Draw the Line?\nThe line is **objective and historical**, not subjective or based on \"who's nicest\" or \"most moral.\" It's at the **irreconcilable core**:\n- **Agreement areas**: All orthodox groups affirm the essentials, allowing secondary differences (e.g., Protestants vs. Catholics on Mary or purgatory).\n- **Departure**: When a group **contradicts the creeds/Scripture on primaries**, it preaches \"another Jesus\" (2 Corinthians 11:4) or \"different gospel\" (Galatians 1:6-9), warranting the label \"non-orthodox\" or \"cult\" in theological parlance (respectfully, as these groups often self-identify as Christian).\n- **Historical precedent**: Early councils excluded Arians, Gnostics, etc., despite their Christian rhetoric. Modern ecumenical bodies (e.g., World Council of Churches) implicitly draw similar lines.\n\n**Respectful nuance**: These groups sincerely follow what they believe is truth, often with strong ethics and evangelistic zeal. Orthodoxy doesn't question their devotion to \"Jesus,\" but notes it's a *different Jesus* from the biblical one. Dialogue is possible on shared values (e.g., love, justice), but theological unity requires creedal alignment. For evaluation, compare a group's statements of faith to the Nicene Creed—persistent contradiction signals departure.\n\nThis framework promotes clarity without condemnation, honoring Jesus' prayer for truth-guided unity (John 17:17-21). If analyzing a specific group, provide their doctrines for deeper comparison.",

          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer robustly articulates a historically grounded criterion for orthodoxy (creeds, the Trinity, the person and work of Christ, scriptural authority, and essential gospel content) and explains how groups may depart from orthodoxy. It cites scriptural support and references early councils/creeds, and it offers a clear framework for evaluating groups that use Christian language. However, it includes a doctrinal nuance that can be contested within historic Christianity (the explicit “grace alone through faith alone” formulation), and it makes a canon claim that glosses over legitimate variations in the Orthodox canon. It also uses the term “cult” in a way that can be polemical. A more precise treatment would acknowledge canonical diversity among Orthodox traditions, note that Orthodox theology emphasizes synergy of grace and faith, and distinguish between heresy, schism, and non-Christian movements without defaulting to pejorative labels. Nonetheless, the core approach and criteria align well with historic orthodoxy and provide a solid evaluative framework for assessing groups claiming to follow Jesus."
