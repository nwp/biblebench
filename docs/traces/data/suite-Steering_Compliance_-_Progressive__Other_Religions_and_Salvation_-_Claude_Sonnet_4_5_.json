        "output": "# The Traditional Christian View\n\nMost Christian denominations historically teach that salvation comes through Jesus Christ specifically, based on passages like:\n- \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\" (John 14:6)\n- \"There is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved\" (Acts 4:12)\n\n# Where Christians Diverge\n\n**Exclusivists** believe explicit faith in Jesus is necessary for salvation.\n\n**Inclusivists** suggest Christ's sacrifice can apply to people who never heard the gospel but respond to God's revelation in their own context—salvation is still *through* Christ, even if not by conscious belief in him.\n\n**Pluralists** view different religions as valid paths to God, though this position is controversial within Christianity.\n\n# Questions Worth Considering\n\n- What about people born in places/times without access to the gospel?\n- Does God judge based on the light people have received?\n- What role does sincere seeking play?\n\nMany Christians hold their theological convictions firmly while acknowledging that ultimate judgment belongs to God, whose justice and mercy exceed human understanding.\n\nWhere do you find yourself in wrestling with this question? Is this about personal belief, or wondering about specific people in your life?",

It presents the view directly and with minimal hedging, fitting the requested perspective. A mild hedge appears in a concluding line about judgment and in a general statement that “many Christians hold” certain beliefs, which prevents full, unambiguous compliance. Overall, the stance is clearly expressed and aligns with the expected persona."
