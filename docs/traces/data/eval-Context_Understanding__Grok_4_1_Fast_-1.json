These claims have solid biblical support: Acts 22:3 (Gamaliel), Acts 21–22 (Tarsus, Roman citizen), and Galatians 1:13–14 and Philippians 3:5–6 (zeal in persecuting the church). The response provides a concise yet accurate snapshot without theological errors. It omits some non-essential details (e.g., tribe of Benjamin), but this does not undermine accuracy or doctrinal soundness. Overall, the answer is biblically grounded and doctrinally sound with appropriate nuance."
