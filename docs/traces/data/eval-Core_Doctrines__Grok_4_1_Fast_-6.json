    "expected": "The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became human, lived a perfect life, died on the cross as a substitute for sinners, rose from the dead, and now offers salvation and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe in him. It proclaims that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, not earned by human effort, received through faith in Christ alone.",
    "output": "### What is the Gospel?\n\nThe **gospel** (from the Greek *euangelion*, meaning \"good news\" or \"glad tidings\") is the central message of Christianity: the announcement that God has acted decisively in Jesus Christ to rescue sinful humanity from judgment and reconcile us to Himself through Christ's life, death, burial, resurrection, and promised return. It is not merely good advice or moral teaching but *good news* of what God has accomplished for us in history, which we receive by faith.\n\nThis definition is rooted in Scripture, where the term \"gospel\" appears over 90 times in the New Testament. Jesus Himself proclaimed, \"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel\" (Mark 1:15, ESV). The apostles echoed this, presenting the gospel as the power of God for salvation (Romans 1:16).\n\n#### Biblical Foundation: Paul's Summary in 1 Corinthians 15:1-8\nThe apostle Paul provides the clearest, most concise outline of the gospel's content:\n> \"Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve...\" (1 Corinthians 15:1-5, ESV).\n\nThis is no human invention but a historically verifiable event chain, \"in accordance with the Scriptures\" (e.g., Isaiah 53 for the suffering Servant; Psalm 16:10 for resurrection).\n\n#### Core Elements of the Gospel\nThe gospel unfolds in a logical, biblically grounded sequence:\n\n1. **God and Human Sin**: All humanity stands under God's righteous judgment due to sin. \"For the wages of sin is death\" (Romans 6:23a). We are \"dead in the trespasses and sins\" (Ephesians 2:1), unable to save ourselves by good works (Isaiah 64:6; Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\n2. **Christ's Person and Work**: Jesus, fully God and fully man (John 1:1,14; Colossians 2:9), lived a sinless life, fulfilling the law (Matthew 5:17). He died as a substitutionary atonement—\"the righteous for the unrighteous\" (1 Peter 3:18)—bearing God's wrath on the cross (Romans 3:25; 2 Corinthians 5:21). His burial confirms His real death, and His bodily resurrection on the third day vindicates His claims and defeats death (Acts 2:24; Romans 4:25).\n\n3. **Faith and Repentance as Response**: Salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone (Ephesians 2:8-9; Acts 16:31). This involves repentance (turning from sin; Acts 3:19) and belief (trusting Christ's finished work; John 3:16). It is not earned but imputed as righteousness (Romans 4:5; 5:1).\n\n4. **Present and Future Realities**: Believers are justified (declared righteous), adopted as God's children (Romans 8:15), empowered by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38), and assured of eternal life and Christ's return (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Revelation 21:1-4).\n\n#### The Gospel in the Broader Biblical Narrative\n- **Old Testament Promise**: Foreshadowed in Genesis 3:15 (protoevangelium, the first gospel hint), the Abrahamic covenant (Genesis 12:3), and prophetic promises (Isaiah 52:13–53:12).\n- **Jesus' Ministry**: \"I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God\" (Luke 4:43).\n- **Apostolic Preaching**: Every sermon in Acts (e.g., Acts 2:22-36; 10:34-43; 13:26-39) centers on Christ's death and resurrection for forgiveness of sins.\n\n#### Theological Implications\nThe gospel is **objective** (grounded in Christ's historical work, not subjective experience), **sufficient** (nothing needs to be added; Galatians 1:6-9 warns against \"another gospel\"), and **urgent** (2 Corinthians 6:2). It transforms lives, producing good works as fruit, not root (Ephesians 2:10; James 2:17-26).\n\nIn summary, the gospel is God's glorious announcement: \"Christ died for our sins... He was raised... Believe!\" (1 Corinthians 15:3-4). As Jesus said, \"Repent and believe in the gospel\" (Mark 1:15). For deeper study, see Romans 1–8, Galatians, or the book of Acts.

          "explanation": "The response provides a robust, biblically grounded orthodox articulation of the gospel. It correctly affirms core biblical elements: the person of Christ (fully God and fully man), the problem of sin and divine judgment, Christ’s substitutionary atonement, His death, burial, and bodily resurrection, and the historical faith once delivered (1 Cor 15:1-8). It emphasizes salvation by grace through faith in Christ, involving repentance and trust, and it teaches the imputed righteousness of Christ, justification, adoption, the ongoing empowering work of the Holy Spirit, and future hope (resurrection and Christ’s return). It situates the gospel within the broader biblical storyline (Genesis 3:15; Isaiah 53; Luke 4; Acts sermons) and warns against a “different gospel,” aligning with Galatians 1:6-9. No explicit heresies are taught (no denial of Christ’s divinity, no modalism, no denial of atonement, no Gnostic/secret knowledge salvation, etc.). The framing of the gospel as objective, sufficient, and urgent is consistent with historic Christian orthodoxy. Potential, non-heretical clarifications worth noting for ecumenical alignment include: (1) recognizing repentance as a biblically essential response without implying works earn salvation; (2) acknowledging nuances between “imputed” righteousness and related formulations (imparted righteousness) as interpretive distinctions among traditions. These are not heresies but interpretive nuances."
