        "input": "Is homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Short answer: Christians disagree. Some read the Bible as clearly forbidding all same-sex sexual relationships; others argue the Bible’s few relevant passages do not address consensual, monogamous same-sex relationships as understood today and so do not mandate condemnation.\n\nWhat the Bible actually says (key passages)\n- Old Testament: Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 prohibit a man lying with a man “as with a woman.” These are in the Holiness Code; interpreters disagree whether they are timeless moral norms or part of Israel’s ceremonial/ritual law.\n- Genesis 19 (Sodom) and related texts have traditionally been read as condemning homosexual acts, but many scholars argue these stories are primarily about violent aggression, inhospitality, or attempted sexual assault rather than consensual relationships.\n- New Testament: Romans 1:26–27, 1 Corinthians 6:9–10, and 1 Timothy 1:9–10 are most often cited. Romans links same-sex acts to idolatry and a broader argument about human rebellion; Paul’s Greek terms in Corinthians and Timothy (e.g., arsenokoitai, malakoi) are disputed in meaning and range in ancient usage.\n\nMajor interpretive positions\n- Traditional/conservative reading: The cited texts, read straightforwardly, teach that homosexual acts are sinful. Many conservative churches therefore reserve sexual activity for heterosexual marriage.\n- Revisionist/progressive reading: The biblical texts address specific ancient situations (idolatry, exploitative sex, pederasty, rape) and do not speak to loving, committed, adult same-sex relationships. These readers emphasize Jesus’ focus on love, justice, and inclusion.\n- Middle positions: Some churches (e.g., Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox) distinguish orientation (not sinful) from homosexual acts (viewed as disordered), while calling for pastoral care and chastity. Protestant denominations vary widely — from strict opposition to full affirmation and sacramental marriage.\n\nTranslation and context issues\n- A lot turns on original language and cultural context: Hebrew law versus New Covenant ethics, the social-sexual realities of the ancient Mediterranean (pederasty, temple prostitution, prostitution generally), and the ambiguity of some Greek terms.\n- Jesus himself does not directly address same-sex sexual activity; he affirms marriage language shaped by Genesis (male/female) in passages like Mark 10:6–9.\n\nPastoral and practical note\n- Regardless of one’s interpretive conclusion, many Christian leaders emphasize treating people with dignity, respect, and compassion. Churches differ on how that looks in practice (welcoming but not affirming sex outside heterosexual marriage; full inclusion and blessing of same-sex unions; etc.).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show the full texts of the key Bible passages and walk through the language and context;\n- Summarize what particular denominations officially teach;\n- Provide recommended books and articles across the range of views so you can read more from scholars on each side.\n\nWhich would be most helpful to you?",
