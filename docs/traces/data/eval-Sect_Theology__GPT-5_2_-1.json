    "input": "Someone says they believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as taught in the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price alongside the Bible. How does this differ from historic Christian teaching?",
    "expected": "While LDS theology uses the language of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, there are critical differences from orthodox Christianity. First, Mormonism teaches three separate gods (tritheism) rather than one God in three persons (Trinity). Second, adding the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price as scripture equal to or superseding the Bible contradicts the Protestant principle of 'sola scriptura' and the historic Christian canon closed in the 4th century. Orthodox Christianity holds to the 66 books of the Bible (Protestant) or includes the Apocrypha (Catholic/Orthodox) but does not accept additional revelations as scriptural canon that modify core doctrines.",
    "output": "Historic (orthodox) Christian teaching about the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is usually summarized by the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed (AD 325/381): **one God** who eternally exists as **three distinct persons**—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who are **consubstantial** (of the same divine essence), coequal, and coeternal. The three persons are not three gods; they are the one God.\n\nWhen someone says they believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit *as taught in the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price alongside the Bible*, they are typically aligning with **Latter-day Saint (LDS) theology**, which has real points of overlap with Christian language and devotion but differs in important doctrinal content.\n\n## Areas of agreement (real overlap)\nMany LDS believers affirm things that sound familiar to historic Christians, such as:\n- The reality of **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit**\n- That **Jesus Christ is the divine Son of God**, Savior, Messiah, risen Lord\n- The importance of faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, prayer, moral transformation, etc.\n\nBecause the vocabulary is shared, the differences are not mainly about “using the names,” but about what those names mean.\n\n## Key departures from historic Christian (Nicene) doctrine\n\n### 1) **“One God” vs. a Godhead of three separate beings**\n**Nicene Christianity:**  \n- God is **one being/essence** (one “what”) in **three persons** (three “whos”).  \n- The Father, Son, and Spirit are not separate divine beings; they are the one God.\n\n**Typical LDS teaching:**  \n- The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are **three distinct beings/personages** who are “one” primarily in **unity of will, purpose, and love**, not one in a shared divine essence.  \n- A frequently cited LDS text is **Doctrine and Covenants 130:22**, which teaches the Father and Son have bodies of “flesh and bones,” and the Holy Ghost does not.\n\n**Why this matters:**  \nFrom a Nicene perspective, this shifts the doctrine from **Trinitarian monotheism** to something closer to a **social trinitarian** or even **tri-theistic** conception (even if LDS believers emphasize unity and typically avoid calling it “three gods” in ordinary speech).\n\n### 2) **God’s nature: incorporeal vs. embodied**\n**Historic Christianity:**  \n- God (in his divine nature) is **spirit** (John 4:24), not embodied, not composed of parts, not located in space the way physical bodies are.  \n- The Son becomes incarnate (takes a human nature) in Jesus Christ, but God’s divine nature is not inherently bodily.\n\n**Typical LDS teaching:**  \n- The Father and the risen Christ are **embodied** in a glorified, physical sense (again, D&C 130:22 is central here).  \n- This implies a fundamentally different metaphysical understanding of God than classical Christian theism.\n\n### 3) **The Son’s eternal relationship to the Father**\n**Historic Christianity:**  \n- The Son is **eternally begotten** of the Father (not created), sharing the one divine essence.  \n- The Son is not a separate deity alongside the Father; he is “God from God.”\n\n**Typical LDS teaching:**  \n- LDS sources describe Jesus as the **Son** in ways that fit a framework of distinct beings and often a broader “family” or “council” structure in the pre-mortal life (especially developed through LDS revelations and teachings).  \n- This differs from the Nicene account of the Son’s eternal generation within the one being of God.\n\n### 4) **Additional scripture and authority as doctrinal control**\n**Historic Christianity:**  \n- The ecumenical creeds and the catholic (universal) tradition interpret Scripture within the boundaries of Nicene Trinitarianism.  \n- The canon does not include LDS scriptures, and doctrinal development is not governed by modern prophets in the LDS sense.\n\n**LDS position:**  \n- The Bible is affirmed, but LDS doctrine is also decisively shaped by the **Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price**, plus authoritative prophetic interpretation.  \n- This means the doctrine of God is not being derived from the Bible as historically interpreted in the early church, but from a **different canon and interpretive authority**.\n\n### 5) **Broader theological implications (often connected)**\nWhile your question is specifically about Father/Son/Spirit, the LDS “Godhead” teaching usually sits within a wider framework that departs from historic Christian doctrine, such as:\n- **Exaltation / theosis** understood in a way that can imply humans may become gods in a stronger sense than historic Christianity teaches (orthodox Christianity teaches participation in God’s life by grace, not becoming gods by nature).\n- Teachings associated with **eternal progression** and (in some LDS statements) God’s relationship to a larger divine order.  \nThese are not minor differences; they change the overall “shape” of monotheism.\n\n## An important nuance: the Book of Mormon’s language can sound more “traditional”\nSome passages in the Book of Mormon read in ways that resemble classic Christian formulations about Christ’s divinity and unity with the Father. Historically, observers have noted that early LDS materials sometimes used more traditional-sounding language, while later LDS authoritative clarifications (especially in Doctrine and Covenants and later teaching) articulate the **distinct-being** view more explicitly. In any case, contemporary LDS doctrine is clear in distinguishing the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost as separate beings.\n\n## Bottom line\nSomeone who believes in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit **as taught in LDS scripture alongside the Bible** is using Christian terms but typically affirming a doctrine of God that differs from historic orthodox Christianity in core ways—especially regarding:\n- **one divine essence** vs. **three distinct divine beings**, and\n- **God’s incorporeal nature** vs. the **embodied Father and Son**.\n\nFor that reason, most historic Christian traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, and the majority of Protestants) regard LDS teaching about God as **non-Nicene** and therefore **outside orthodox Trinitarian doctrine**, while still recognizing that LDS believers sincerely intend to honor the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n\nIf you want, I can lay this out side-by-side using the Nicene Creed’s key phrases (“one God,” “begotten not made,” etc.) and the LDS statements that most directly correspond to each line.",

          "rationale": "The response accurately outlines the core orthodox Trinitarian view (one God in three coequal, coeternal persons) and the principal LDS differences (distinct beings with embodied Father/Son, Holy Ghost as a Spirit; additional LDS scriptures; authority structure). It also notes overlaps in language and some broader implications. Minor precision issues concern labeling LDS theology as tri-theistic without acknowledging the nuanced LDS self-understanding, and the canonical status of scriptures (especially the Orthodox canon) is more complex than summarized. Overall, the answer is solid, with small clarifications needed for perfect precision."
