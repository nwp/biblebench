    "input": "Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science, wrote 'Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,' which Christian Scientists study alongside the Bible as authoritative revelation. What's the orthodox Christian perspective on this?",
    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity rejects placing any human writing on par with Scripture's unique divine authority. While commentaries, theological works, and devotional writings can be helpful, the Bible alone is the inspired, inerrant Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16-17). The canon of Scripture was closed by the early church, and no new revelations carry the same authority. Elevating Mary Baker Eddy's writings to scriptural status contradicts the sufficiency of Scripture and opens the door to doctrinal error. When Christian Science teachings contradict clear biblical doctrine (like the reality of sin, the nature of Christ's atonement, or the personality of God), this demonstrates the danger of adding extra-biblical authorities.",
    "output": "From the standpoint of **orthodox (Nicene) Christianity**—including the major streams of **Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox** theology—treating *Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures* as **authoritative revelation alongside the Bible** is viewed as a significant departure from the Church’s understanding of **revelation, Scripture, and the limits of doctrinal authority**.\n\n## 1) The orthodox Christian doctrine of revelation and the “closed canon”\nOrthodox Christianity holds that God has truly revealed himself in history, supremely in **Jesus Christ**, and that the Church received a normative apostolic witness to that revelation in **Holy Scripture**.\n\n- **Protestant view (sola Scriptura):** the Bible is the unique, final, and sufficient written authority for Christian faith and doctrine. Other writings may be helpful, but they cannot be placed on the same level as Scripture.\n- **Catholic and Eastern Orthodox view:** the Church also receives **Sacred Tradition** (the apostolic faith as lived and transmitted in the Church) and authoritative teaching offices. But crucially, this is not an “open-ended” addition of new canonical books. It is the Church’s reception and faithful handing-on of the original apostolic deposit.\n\nDespite differences among Christians on *how* authority works, there is broad agreement on this:  \n**the canon of Scripture is closed**, and no later book can be classed as divinely inspired Scripture in the same sense as the Bible.\n\nThis is often expressed through ideas like:\n- the faith “once for all delivered to the saints” (Jude 3),\n- God’s definitive revelation in Christ (Heb. 1:1–2),\n- and the Church’s early recognition (in councils and practice) of which writings are apostolic and inspired.\n\nSo the claim that Eddy’s book functions as *authoritative revelation* **alongside** Scripture runs counter to the mainstream Christian conviction that **public, binding revelation is not being added to after the apostolic era**.\n\n## 2) How orthodox Christians would classify Eddy’s book\nOrthodox Christians would generally see *Science and Health* as one of the following (depending on the Christian tradition and the individual’s tone):\n\n- a **theological commentary** on the Bible (even if they strongly disagree with it), or  \n- a **new interpretive authority** that effectively reframes Scripture under a different doctrinal system.\n\nWhat they would *not* grant is that it has **canonical** or **Scripture-level** authority.\n\nA useful comparison: many Christians can read sermons, catechisms, theologians, devotional classics, or even official church documents as important guides—but orthodox Christianity insists these are **normed by Scripture** (and, in Catholic/Orthodox understanding, by Scripture as received within apostolic Tradition). They are not parallel “second Bibles.”\n\n## 3) Why this matters: authority is tied to doctrine\nThe concern is not merely “another book.” The deeper issue is that *Science and Health* teaches a framework that **significantly reinterprets central Christian claims**, often in ways the historic Church has judged incompatible with apostolic faith. For example (stated respectfully but plainly):\n\n- **God and Christ:** Christian Science’s metaphysical approach tends to diverge from classical Trinitarian and incarnational teaching (as defined in the Nicene tradition).\n- **Matter, sin, suffering, and healing:** Christian Science’s understanding of matter and evil often differs sharply from orthodox Christianity’s view that creation is real and good (though fallen), and that sin is not merely an illusion to be overcome by right perception.\n- **Atonement and salvation:** classic Christianity centers salvation on the real incarnation, death, and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ for sinners; Christian Science typically reframes these themes in ways orthodox Christianity does not recognize as equivalent.\n\nBecause the doctrines diverge at multiple core points, orthodox Christians often conclude that giving *Science and Health* Scripture-like authority functions not as an aid to Christian interpretation but as an **alternative doctrinal system**.\n\n## 4) Areas of partial agreement (important for fairness)\nOrthodox Christians can acknowledge that Christian Scientists often:\n- show serious engagement with the Bible,\n- emphasize God’s goodness,\n- highlight the importance of faith, prayer, and spiritual transformation,\n- and aim to take Jesus’ ministry seriously.\n\nThose emphases can resonate with Christian concerns. The disagreement arises when these emphases are embedded in a framework that the historic Church believes departs from the faith’s core confession about God, creation, sin, Christ, and redemption.\n\n## 5) Bottom line: the orthodox Christian perspective\nOrthodox Christianity would say:\n\n- **It is legitimate to write and read theological works** about the Bible.\n- **It is not orthodox** to treat a post-biblical text as **authoritative revelation on par with Scripture**.\n- In this case, the problem is intensified because the text is seen as promoting doctrinal interpretations that **conflict with historic Christian teaching**.\n\nIf you want, I can summarize how **Protestants vs Catholics vs Eastern Orthodox** would each articulate this critique in their own terms, or I can outline the specific doctrinal points where Christian Science is most commonly judged to depart from Nicene Christianity.",

In common usage, 'Orthodox' refers to the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions, while Protestant traditions are distinct. This could mislead readers about the spectrum of views on Scripture and Tradition."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer accurately reflects the orthodox position on revelation, the closed canon, and the distinction between Scripture and extra-biblical writings like Science and Health. It correctly notes that orthodox Christians would not treat Eddy’s writings as canonical alongside Scripture and explains how Christian Science contrasts with historic Christian doctrines (God, the nature of Christ, sin, and atonement). It also acknowledges areas of partial agreement and provides nuance about how different traditions view authority. The main potential misstep is a casual lumping of Protestant, Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox into a single 'orthodox (Nicene) Christianity' frame; doctrinal nuances between Protestant and Catholic/Eastern Orthodox approaches to authority and Tradition are significant and worth noting separately for full accuracy."
