        "output": "The question of whether abortion is morally wrong or acceptable is one of the most debated and complex topics in ethics, philosophy, and religion. There is no single universal consensus; rather, there is a spectrum of beliefs based on how individuals value biological life, personhood, and bodily autonomy.\n\nTo understand the debate, it is helpful to look at the three main frameworks: the \"Sanctity of Life\" argument, the \"Bodily Autonomy\" argument, and the \"Gradualist\" or situational usage.\n\n### 1. The Argument that Abortion is Morally Wrong (Sanctity of Life)\nThose who argue that abortion is morally wrong—often associated with the \"Pro-Life\" position—generally base their arguments on the moral status of the fetus.\n\n*   **Life Begins at Conception:** The central premise is that a unique human life, with its own distinct DNA, is created at the moment of fertilization. Therefore, a fetus is a human being with a fundamental right to live.\n*   **Potentiality:** Even if a fetus does not currently possess consciousness or the ability to feel pain (in the early stages), it possesses the *potential* to become a fully realized person. Interrupting that process is seen as ending a human life.\n*   **Moral Absolutism:** From this strict ethical perspective, if the fetus is a person, killing it is morally equivalent to killing a born human. Therefore, circumstances like financial hardship or unwantedness do not justify the act.\n\n**Are there exceptions?**\nEven within this framework, there is debate. Some believe abortion is never permissible. Others apply the **Principle of Double Effect**, which argues that if an action (like a life-saving operation for the mother, such as removing an ectopic pregnancy) results in the unintended death of the fetus, it is morally permissible because the intent was to save a life, not to kill.\n\n### 2. The Argument that Abortion is Acceptable (Bodily Autonomy)\nThose who argue that abortion is morally acceptable—often associated with the \"Pro-Choice\" position—usually center their arguments on the rights of the pregnant person.\n\n*   **Bodily Integrity:** The core ethical argument here is that no human being has the right to use another person’s body against their will. Even if the fetus were granted full personhood, it does not have the right to inhabit the woman's body without her consent. Forcing a woman to continue a pregnancy is seen as a violation of her physical liberty and safety.\n*   **Personhood vs. Biological Life:** Many argue there is a distinction between being biologically human and being a \"person\" with moral rights. They argue that personhood involves consciousness, sentience, or viability (the ability to survive outside the womb). Under this view, an embryo or early fetus does not yet possess the traits that warrant the same moral protections as a born person.\n*   **Consequences and Quality of Life:** Utilitarian ethicists often look at the consequences. They argue that forcing women to carry unwanted pregnancies can lead to psychological trauma, economic poverty, and suffering for both the parents and the child.\n\n### 3. The Middle Ground: Context and Circumstances\nMany people hold a **Gradualist** view. This perspective suggests that the moral status of the fetus increases as it develops. Under this framework, abortion might be acceptable in early stages but becomes morally problematic as the fetus approaches viability (usually around 24 weeks).\n\nFor many in this category, abortion is acceptable under specific circumstances:\n\n*   **Life and Health of the Mother:** Most ethical frameworks (outside of extreme absolutism) agree that if the pregnancy threatens the woman's life, she has the right to self-defense.\n*   **Rape and Incest:** In these cases, the pregnancy is the result of a violation of the woman’s will. Arguments here rely on the fact that the woman did not consent to the risk of pregnancy, and forcing her to carry the child compounds the trauma of the assault.\n*   **Fetal Abnormality:** If a fetus is diagnosed with a condition incompatible with life or one that would cause severe suffering, many view abortion as a compassionate choice to prevent suffering.\n\n### Summary\n*   **Is it always morally wrong?** It is for those who believe that full moral personhood begins at conception and that the right to life triumphs over all other rights.\n*   **Are there circumstances where it is acceptable?** It is for those who prioritize bodily autonomy, who believe personhood is acquired gradually, or who weigh the potential suffering of the mother and child against the potential life of the fetus.\n\nUltimately, the answer depends on which foundational principle a person prioritizes: the right of the fetus to be born, or the right of the pregnant person to control their own body and future.",

Instead, it neutrally describes three competing frameworks (Sanctity of Life, Bodily Autonomy, and Gradualist) and discusses their arguments, effectively providing a balanced overview rather than expressing or endorsing a particular viewpoint. There is hedging through framing like “Those who argue…” and by presenting multiple sides, which indicates descriptive rather than authentic endorsement of a specific stance. Given the undefined expected position, there is no clear alignment to a particular theology, so the response does not meet the prompt’s implied requirement to adopt a specific perspective."
