    "output": "In biblical scholarship, determining the primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7) involves examining both the internal narrative of the Gospel of Matthew and the historical context of the community for whom Matthew was writing.\n\nThe audience can be categorized into three distinct levels: the immediate narrative audience, the intended Matthean community, and the universal audience.\n\n### 1. The Immediate Narrative Audience (The Disciples)\nAccording to the text of Matthew 5:1–2, Jesus sees the \"crowds,\" goes up on a mountain, and sits down. The text explicitly states, **\"his disciples came to him, and he began to speak, and taught them.\"**\n\n*   **Priority of Discipleship:** Most scholars agree that while the crowds were present (and are mentioned again as \"amazed\" at the end of the sermon in 7:28), the sermon is primarily addressed to the inner circle of followers. \n*   **The \"Mountain\" Motif:** In a Jewish context, the mountain setting evokes Moses on Mount Sinai. Just as Moses gave the Law to the covenant people, Jesus provides the \"New Law\" or the definitive interpretation of the Torah to his new community of disciples.\n\n### 2. The Original Literary Audience (The Matthean Community)\nBeyond the characters in the story, scholars look at the community for whom the Gospel of Matthew was originally written (roughly 80–90 CE).\n\n*   **Jewish-Christian Context:** The majority view among scholars is that Matthew was written for a primarily **Jewish-Christian audience**, likely in or around Antioch. This is evidenced by the sermon’s heavy focus on the Torah, \"righteousness,\" and the relationship between Jesus’ teachings and the \"Law and the Prophets\" (Matthew 5:17).\n*   **Defining Identity:** At the time of Matthew's writing, the early church was beginning to separate from the synagogue. The sermon served as a manual for this community, defining how they were to live differently from both the \"Gentiles\" (6:7, 6:32) and the \"hypocrites\" or religious leaders of the day (6:2, 6:5).\n\n### 3. The Universal Audience (The \"Crowds\")\nWhile the disciples are the primary target, the \"crowds\" (the *ochloi*) serve a significant function in the text.\n\n*   **The Fringe Observers:** The crowds represent the \"weary and burdened\" of Israel and the world. By having the crowds overhead the sermon, Matthew suggests that the invitation to discipleship is open to all.\n*   **Proclamation vs. Instruction:** Some scholars distinguish between *kerygma* (proclamation to the world) and *didache* (instruction for believers). The Sermon on the Mount is viewed as *didache*—a blueprint for those who have already decided to follow Jesus.\n\n### Scholarly Perspectives on Interpretation\nThere is a long-standing debate regarding how the audience was intended to **apply** the sermon:\n\n*   **The Lutheran View:** Historically, some scholars (influenced by Martin Luther) argued the sermon was an \"impossible ideal\" intended to show the audience their sin and need for grace.\n*   **The Anabaptist/Social View:** Others argue it was intended as a literal, practical code of ethics for an alternative society.\n*   **The Majority Scholarly View:** Most contemporary scholars believe the sermon was intended for a **community of practice**. It was not an impossible ideal, but a \"Greater Righteousness\" meant to be lived out by the community of faith as a witness to the world.\n\n### Summary\nThe **primary audience** was the **disciples**, who represented the \"new Israel.\" However, the **secondary audience** was the **Matthean community** of Jewish Christians, for whom the sermon functioned as a foundational document for their identity and ethics in a Greco-Roman and post-Temple Jewish world.",

          "rationale": "The response accurately identifies the primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount as Jesus’ disciples (the immediate narrative audience) and notes the presence of the crowds, as well as the Matthean community as a distinct, later (literary) audience. It correctly situates the sermon within Matthew 5–7, discusses the mountain motif, and reflects scholarly debates about audience and purpose (kerygma vs didache; Lutheran vs Anabaptist vs majority view of a community of practice). It also acknowledges the broader, universal function of the text. A minor caveat is the claim that the Matthean community was “likely in or around Antioch,” which is a debated proposition among scholars and should be treated as one possible location among others rather than a settled fact. Overall, the answer is factually accurate, thorough, and appropriately nuanced for the question asked."
