    "output": "In biblical scholarship, identifying the audience of the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7) requires looking at both the internal narrative of the Gospel of Matthew and the historical context of the community for whom the Gospel was written.\n\nThe audience can be categorized into three distinct groups:\n\n### 1. The Immediate Narrative Audience: The Disciples\nAccording to the text itself, the primary and immediate audience consisted of Jesus’s closest followers. Matthew 5:1–2 states: \n\n> *\"Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. And he opened his mouth and taught them...\"*\n\nWhile the crowds were present, Jesus specifically addressed the **disciples**. This is significant because the Sermon is often viewed by scholars not as a general \"plan for world peace,\" but as a \"community manifesto\" or a code of ethics for those who had already committed to following Him. The use of the second person (\"You are the salt of the earth\") reinforces this direct address to the inner circle.\n\n### 2. The Secondary Narrative Audience: The Crowds\nAlthough the sermon was directed at the disciples, a large, diverse crowd was listening in the background. Matthew 7:28–29 records the reaction of these crowds:\n\n> *\"And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as one who had authority...\"*\n\nHistorically, these crowds would have consisted of Judeans and Galileans, but also people from the Decapolis and beyond—likely a mix of observant Jews, \"marginal\" Jews, and perhaps some Gentiles. For this audience, the Sermon served as an invitation to understand the true nature of the Kingdom of Heaven, contrasted against the teachings of the scribes and Pharisees.\n\n### 3. The Gospel’s Intended Audience: Jewish Christians\nFrom a scholarly and historical-critical perspective, we must consider the audience for whom the author of Matthew wrote. \n\nThe majority of scholars believe the Gospel of Matthew was written in the late 1st century (c. 80–90 AD), likely for a **Jewish-Christian community** (possibly in Antioch). This is evidenced by:\n*   **The Mosaic Parallel:** Matthew portrays Jesus as a \"New Moses\" delivering a \"New Law\" from a mountain, mirroring Moses receiving the Law on Mount Sinai.\n*   **Torah Continuity:** The Sermon emphasizes that Jesus did not come to abolish the Law or the Prophets but to fulfill them (Matt 5:17). \n*   **Polemic Context:** Much of the Sermon (especially the \"Six Antitheses\") addresses Jewish legal interpretation. The intended readers were likely struggling with their identity as followers of Jesus while remaining in dialogue (or conflict) with traditional Pharisaic Judaism.\n\n### Summary of Perspectives\n*   **Traditional View:** Focuses on the literal disciples and the \"great commission\" to spread these teachings to all believers.\n*   **Critical/Historical View:** Focuses on the Matthean community—believers of Jewish descent who needed to understand how Jesus’s teachings related to the Mosaic Law and the emerging Rabbinic tradition.\n\nIn conclusion, while the **disciples** were the primary intended recipients within the story, the **crowds** acted as witnesses, and the **Jewish-Christian church** was the primary historical audience for whom the record was preserved and shaped.",

It also adds a well-supported historical-critical point: the Gospel of Matthew is widely viewed as written for a Jewish-Christian community, with motifs like the New Moses and Torah continuity (Matt 5:17) helping to frame its audience and purposes. The response discusses multiple scholarly perspectives (traditional vs. critical/historical) and notes dating and compositional context (late 1st century, likely Jewish-Christian readers, possibly Antioch), while signaling uncertainty where appropriate. These elements directly address the question and provide appropriate nuance. Minor caveats (e.g., exact identification of audiences within the crowd, or the precise dating/location of Matthew) are within standard scholarly ranges and do not constitute factual errors. Overall, the answer is accurate, comprehensive, and appropriately nuanced given the topic.)"
