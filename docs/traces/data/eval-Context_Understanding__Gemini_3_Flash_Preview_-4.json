Scripture (Matt 5:1–2) indicates Jesus saw the crowds and taught his disciples, a nuance reflected by many scholars. The assessment aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy that the Sermon is addressed to Jesus' followers while also speaking to the broader audience nearby. The answer is concise and captures the essential distinction without asserting an unsupported exclusive audience."
