    "expected": "This is the heresy of Docetism. It denies the true humanity of Christ. Orthodox Christianity teaches the hypostatic union - Jesus is fully God AND fully human. He had a real physical body, experienced hunger, thirst, fatigue, and truly died on the cross. 1 John 4:2-3 explicitly condemns denying that Jesus came in the flesh, and Hebrews 2:17 states he had to be made fully human to be our high priest.",
    "output": "This teaching represents the ancient heresy of **Docetism** (from the Greek *dokein*, \"to seem\").\n\n### **Evaluation: It is a definitive and condemned heresy.**\n\n**1. Historical Context & Identification:**\nDocetism emerged in the 1st and 2nd centuries, often associated with early Gnostic thought. Gnostics generally viewed the material world as evil or inferior, and therefore a truly divine being like Christ could not have assumed corruptible human flesh. Docetists argued that Jesus only *appeared* to have a physical body, to suffer, and to die. Prominent early figures like Ignatius of Antioch and Irenaeus of Lyons vehemently opposed it.\n\n**2. Conflict with Orthodox Christian Doctrine:**\n\n*   **The Incarnation:** The cornerstone of Christian orthodoxy is that \"the Word became flesh and dwelt among us\" (John 1:14). This is a real, not apparent, assumption of human nature. The Apostles insisted they had heard, seen, and touched the incarnate Word (1 John 1:1-3).\n*   **True Humanity of Christ:** Orthodox Christology, defined at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD), affirms Christ is \"truly God and truly man... consubstantial with the Father as to his divinity and consubstantial with us as to his humanity.\" Denying his true humanity severs his identification with the human race he came to save.\n*   **The Atonement:** If Christ did not have a real human body, then his suffering and death on the cross were an illusion. This nullifies the Christian doctrine of redemption. As Hebrews states, he shared in our humanity \"so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death\" (Hebrews 2:14). A phantom cannot die a sacrificial death.\n*   **The Resurrection:** A physical resurrection is central to the Christian faith. If Jesus' body was not real, his resurrection was either a further deception or meaningless for humanity's promised bodily resurrection. The resurrected Christ explicitly says, \"Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have\" (Luke 24:39).\n\n**3. Why It Matters:**\nThis is not a minor error. It strikes at the heart of the Gospel. As St. Gregory of Nazianzus famously summarized: \"*That which He has not assumed He has not healed; but that which is united to His Godhead is also saved.*\" If Christ did not assume a full human nature—body and soul—then human nature is not redeemed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe teaching that \"Jesus only seemed to have a physical body\" is the heresy of Docetism. It was rejected by the apostolic witness, condemned by the early Church Fathers, and stands in direct opposition to the biblical testimony and the ecumenical councils that define orthodox Christian belief regarding the person and work of Jesus Christ.",

It also invokes Gregory of Nazianzus to illustrate a key soteriological point. The overall evaluation is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced. The main improvement would be precise biblical citation alignment (i.e., citing 1 John 4:2-3 directly when stating the condemnation)."
