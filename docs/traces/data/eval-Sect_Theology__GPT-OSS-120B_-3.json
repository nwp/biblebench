    "expected": "LDS theology teaches that Jesus and Lucifer (Satan) are spirit brothers, both created by God the Father in a pre-mortal existence. This is incompatible with orthodox Christianity for several reasons: (1) Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17 says all things were created through him); (2) Jesus is worshiped as God (Hebrews 1:6) while Satan is a fallen angel; (3) This teaching diminishes Christ's unique divine nature and blurs the absolute distinction between the Creator and creation. Orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus as the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity, while Satan is a created angelic being who rebelled.",
    "output": "**Latter‑Day Saint (LDS) teaching about Jesus and Lucifer**\n\n| Topic | LDS belief | Source |\n|-------|------------|--------|\n| **Pre‑mortal existence** | All human beings – including Jesus and Lucifer – existed as spirit “children” of God before the world was created. | *Pearl of Great Price* — **Book of Abraham** 3:26‑30; **Joseph Smith–Matthew** 3:17‑21 |\n| **Jesus** | The “firstborn” of the Father, the only “only begotten” Son, who was chosen to be the Redeemer (see **Mosiah 3:5‑8** in the Book of Mormon). He received a “glorious body” after the Resurrection and is the “Only Begotten in the flesh.” | Book of Mormon, *Mosiah* 3:5‑8; Doctrine & Covenants (D&C) 1:30; D&C 20:12‑13 |\n| **Lucifer** | A spirit “of the sons of God” who, in the pre‑mortal council, proposed a plan that would have “cursed” humanity (the “Plan of Salvation” of the Father). He rebelled, was cast out, and became Satan, the “prince of the devil.” | D&C 76:27‑31; *Pearl of Great Price* — **Moses** 1:39‑45 |\n| **Relationship** | Both Jesus and Lucifer are created spirit‑children of the Father. Their “relationship” is thus that of brothers who made opposite choices: Jesus accepted the Father’s plan to bring salvation; Lucifer rejected it and was expelled. Because they are created, neither is co‑eternal with the Father, and the Father is the ultimate source of both. | D&C 76:31‑34; *Book of Abraham* — 3:27‑30 |\n\n---\n\n### How this compares with **orthodox Christian theology**\n\n| Issue | LDS position | Orthodox Christian (historic) position |\n|-------|--------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Nature of God** | God the Father is a glorified, exalted man who once lived as a mortal on another world; He has a physical body (see D&C 130:22). | God is spirit, *simple* and *immutable*; the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are consubstantial, co‑eternal, and indivisible (Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed). |\n| **Eternity of the Son** | Jesus is a created “firstborn” spirit who became the Only Begotten Son **in the flesh**; prior to the incarnation He was a distinct being in the pre‑mortal council. | The Son (the Logos) is uncreated, eternally begotten of the Father, not a created being (John 1:1‑3; Council of Nicaea 325). |\n| **Lucifer’s status** | Lucifer is a created spirit, a “son of God” who fell. He is not a demonic *force* independent of God; rather, he is a party in the pre‑mortal council that rebelled. | Lucifer (Satan) is a created angelic being (a *creature*), but he is *not* a co‑equal or co‑eternal rival to the Son. The fall is a moral rebellion, not an ontological parity. |\n| **The “firstborn” language** | “Firstborn” denotes rank or pre‑eminence among created spirits; it does **not** imply eternal pre‑existence as God. | In orthodox usage, “firstborn” is a title for the Son’s unique relationship to the Father, rooted in his eternal generation; it is not a statement about creation but about divine relationship (cf. Col 1:15). |\n| **Potential for deification** | The “exaltation” doctrine teaches that faithful humans may become “gods” and inherit all that the Father has, essentially “becoming like” Him (see *Pearl of Great Price* — **Moses** 1:39). | Orthodox Christianity affirms *theosis* (participation in divine life), but firmly rejects the idea that humans become *ontologically equal* with God; deification is always *participatory* and *dependently* rooted in the uncreated God. |\n\n---\n\n### Why orthodox Christians find the LDS picture “problematic”\n\n1. **Christ’s divinity is not presented as uncreated**  \n   - The Nicene Creed (325 AD) declares that the Son is “*begotten, not made,*” “*of one substance (homoousios) with the Father*.”  \n   - LDS teaching that Jesus is a “firstborn” created spirit distinguishes Him from the Father, making Him *ontologically subordinate*. From an orthodox standpoint this undermines the doctrine of the Trinity and the biblical claim that the Son “*is God*” (John 1:1; 10:30).  \n\n2. **The “pre‑mortal council” creates a quasi‑dualistic rivalry**  \n   - The idea that a created being (Lucifer) could present an *alternative* plan to God and be cast out as a *rival* suggests that the Father’s authority can be contested.  \n   - In historic Christianity, God’s will is sovereign; angels (including Satan) have no capacity to thwart divine providence. The LDS narrative thus appears to introduce a *proto‑dualism* that is foreign to orthodox doctrine.  \n\n3. **Anthropomorphic view of the Father**  \n   - The LDS claim that God the Father “*once lived as a mortal man*” (D&C 130:22) conflicts with **Scripture** (e.g., *John 4:24* “*God is spirit*”) and the early church’s insistence on God’s *spiritual, non‑material* nature.  \n   - The orthodox formulation of God’s *incorporeality* is a cornerstone of the Creed; anthropomorphism is regarded as a theological error.  \n\n4. **“Exaltation” and the potential for humans to become gods**  \n   - While *theosis* is accepted in Eastern Orthodoxy, it is always *participatory* and *not* a claim that humans will *become* gods in the sense of possessing divine essence.  \n   - The LDS doctrine that faithful believers can “*inherit all that the Father has*” (see *Moses* 1:39) is seen as a *break* with orthodox monotheism, bordering on *polytheism* or *henotheism*.  \n\n5. **Implications for soteriology**  \n   - Since Jesus is viewed as a created Being who *voluntarily* accepted the Father’s plan, the *ontological basis* for the atonement (Christ’s infinite divinity sharing in humanity) is altered.  \n   - Orthodox soteriology depends on the *eternal* Son’s *hypostatic union* (fully God and fully man) to effect a perfect, infinite sacrifice. If Christ is merely a *great* created spirit, the *infinite* nature of the atonement is called into question.  \n\n---\n\n### Points of **agreement** (where LDS and orthodox Christianity intersect)\n\n| Area | LDS view | Orthodox view |\n|------|----------|----------------|\n| **Lucifer as the origin of evil** | Lucifer rebelled and became Satan, the “prince of the devil.” | Scripture identifies Satan (originally “the devil” or “the accuser”) as a fallen angel (Ezekiel 28; Isaiah 14; Revelation 12). |\n| **Jesus as the Redeemer** | Jesus is the “Only Begotten Son” who atoned for humanity’s sins (Mosiah 3:5‑8). | The New Testament teaches that Christ’s death and resurrection provide salvation (Romans 5; 1 Cor 15). |\n| **A pre‑mortal existence of souls** | All humans existed as spirit children of God before birth. | Early church fathers (e.g., Irenaeus) entertained the idea of *pre‑existence* for *angelic* beings but not for ordinary humans; the mainstream Christian tradition affirms that human souls are created at conception. |\n| **The reality of a future judgment** | Both traditions teach that a final judgment will occur and souls will be assigned to a glorious or a damned state. | The New Testament repeatedly affirms a final judgment (Matthew 25; Revelation 20). |\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Core LDS claim:** Jesus and Lucifer are *brothers*—both created spirit‑children of God—who made opposite choices in a pre‑mortal council. Jesus accepted the Father’s plan of salvation; Lucifer rejected it and became Satan.\n- **Orthodox Christian critique:** The LDS picture makes the Son *created* rather than *uncreated*, introduces a dualistic pre‑mortal power struggle, posits an anthropomorphic Father, and teaches a form of human deification that threatens monotheistic doctrine. These points conflict with the historic creeds, the doctrine of the Trinity, the biblical portrayal of God’s incorporeality, and the classical understanding of Christ’s nature and work of atonement.\n- **Shared convictions:** Both traditions condemn Lucifer’s rebellion, affirm Jesus’s role as Redeemer, and anticipate a final judgment. The disagreement lies primarily in *how* God, Christ, and Satan relate ontologically and historically.\n\nIn respectful dialogue, it is helpful to acknowledge that LDS members sincerely believe they are worshipping **the same Savior** and that their narrative is rooted in a distinct set of revelations (e.g., the Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants). From the perspective of the historic Christian church, however, the **essential doctrines of God’s eternality, the uncreated nature of the Son, and the monotheistic unity of the divine nature** remain non‑negotiable standards for orthodoxy. Consequently, the LDS view of Jesus and Lucifer is regarded as a *significant departure* from those standards.",

            "The claim about Irenaeus entertaining preexistence of human souls is historically inaccurate or at least not representative of orthodox teaching; mainstream patristic consensus did not affirm a preexistence of ordinary human souls (Origen and others debated such ideas, but Irenaeus is generally seen arguing against Gnostic pre-existence notions).",
            "Some phrasing around Moses 1:39 and “inherit all that the Father has” can be misleading or misquoted in standard LDS terms; the canonical wording in Moses 1:39 is not a direct statement about becoming gods, and orthodox readers often point to Abraham 3:26–28 and related sources to describe exaltation rather than a straightforward ontological equality with God. The response could more clearly distinguish what LDS sources actually teach versus how critics summarize it."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer correctly summarizes core LDS claims (premortal spirit children, Jesus as the preeminent Son “in the flesh,” Lucifer as a premortal rebel, and the idea of exaltation). It also accurately presents orthodox critiques (eternality and uncreated nature of the Son, monotheism, proper anthropology of God, and the atonement). The main strengths are the clear identification of the problems from an orthodox vantage point and the retention of nuance (e.g., theosis is participatory, not ontological equality). The main weaknesses are a historical inaccuracy about Irenaeus’ views on soul preexistence and potential misquotation/misrepresentation of Moses 1:39 and related exaltation language, which could mislead readers about LDS explicit claims. Overall, the response is solid but would benefit from correcting those historical nuances and tightening the scriptural citations to reflect canonical LDS sources precisely."
