It also notes his Roman citizenship. Each element is supported by Scripture (Pharisee: Acts 23:6; Gal 1:13-14; Philippians 3:5-6; from Tarsus: Acts 21:39; Acts 22:3; and Roman citizenship: Acts 22:28; 25:11). These details align with traditional Christian teaching and are biblically grounded. The answer is concise and focuses on the essential background without asserting details beyond scriptural support. A fuller treatment might mention his Hebrew/Philistine education and later radical transformation, but those are additional nuances rather than corrections to the core background."
