          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately identifies the teaching as Gnosticism and situates it within orthodox Christian doctrine. It correctly contrasts Gnostic ideas (salvation through secret knowledge, inherent evil of matter, and redemption as escape from material reality) with biblical teaching (salvation by faith in Christ, creation as good, and bodily resurrection). It cites relevant scriptures to support its claims (Ephesians 2:8-9; Matthew 28:19-20; Genesis 1:31; 1 Corinthians 15; John 1:14) and references the historic condemnation by church fathers, which aligns with historical orthodoxy. It also emphasizes the Incarnation as a refutation of Gnostic dualism. The answer could be strengthened by explicit reference to New Testament passages that directly counter Gnostic error (e.g., 1 John and Colossians), but the biblical grounding remains solid and the nuance is well handled (distinguishing secret knowledge from publicly proclaimed gospel, affirming creation’s goodness, and the hope of bodily resurrection)."
