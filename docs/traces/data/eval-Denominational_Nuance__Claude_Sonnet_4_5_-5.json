    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",
    "output": "# Spiritual Gifts: Charismatic/Pentecostal vs. Cessationist Views\n\nThis represents one of the most significant practical divisions among Bible-believing Christians today, though both positions are held by orthodox believers committed to scriptural authority.\n\n## The Charismatic/Pentecostal Position\n\n**Core belief:** All spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament, including prophecy, tongues, interpretation, healing, and miracles, remain available and active in the church today.\n\n**Key arguments:**\n- Scripture nowhere explicitly states that certain gifts would cease before Christ's return\n- The phrase \"when completeness comes\" (1 Cor. 13:10) refers to Christ's return or the eternal state, not the completion of the biblical canon\n- The gifts were given to empower the church for its mission until Christ returns (Acts 1:8)\n- Historical evidence suggests gifts continued beyond the apostolic age, even if less documented\n- Personal testimonies of contemporary experiences with these gifts\n\n**Denominational homes:** Assemblies of God, Church of God in Christ, many independent charismatic churches, and charismatic movements within mainline denominations\n\n## The Cessationist Position\n\n**Core belief:** The \"sign gifts\" (particularly tongues, prophecy, and miracles) ceased with the apostolic age or the completion of Scripture, though other gifts (teaching, mercy, administration, etc.) continue.\n\n**Key arguments:**\n- These gifts served a foundational purpose—authenticating the apostles and the new revelation they brought (2 Cor. 12:12; Heb. 2:3-4)\n- Once Scripture was complete, the need for revelatory gifts ended\n- \"When completeness comes\" refers to the completed biblical canon\n- The qualitative difference between biblical miraculous gifts and contemporary claims\n- Concern that continuing revelation could undermine Scripture's sufficiency\n- Church history shows a general decline in these gifts after the apostolic period\n\n**Denominational homes:** Many Reformed churches, most Baptist groups, evangelical denominations influenced by Reformed theology, and conservative Presbyterian bodies\n\n## Areas of Common Ground\n\nDespite differences, both groups affirm:\n- The authority and inspiration of Scripture\n- The necessity of the Holy Spirit's work in salvation and sanctification\n- That spiritual gifts are given for building up the church\n- That God can and does answer prayer, including prayers for healing\n- The importance of discernment regarding spiritual experiences\n\n## Moderate Positions\n\nSome Christians hold mediating views:\n- **Open but cautious:** Gifts haven't necessarily ceased, but contemporary manifestations should be carefully tested against Scripture (many evangelical churches take this stance)\n- **Different but continuing:** All gifts continue but may function differently than in the apostolic age\n- **Selective cessationism:** Some gifts ceased while others clearly continue\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nThese differences affect:\n- Worship style and expression\n- Expectations regarding healing and miracles\n- Views on how God guides believers today\n- Approach to prophecy and contemporary \"words from God\"\n- Church leadership structures and decision-making\n\n## A Respectful Approach\n\nThis debate involves sincere Christians interpreting the same Scripture differently. Both positions attempt to honor God's Word and the Spirit's work. The key questions involve hermeneutics (how we interpret certain passages) and the relationship between Scripture, apostolic authority, and ongoing Spirit activity—complex issues on which godly scholars disagree.\n\nChristians on both sides should avoid caricaturing the other: cessationists aren't denying the Spirit's power, and charismatics aren't (in orthodox expression) claiming authority equal to Scripture.",

It presents both charismatic/cessationist positions with parallel structure, acknowledges core common ground, and notes moderate positions. Denominational examples are given for each side, illustrating the diversity within those groups without endorsing one side. While it conveys standard argumentative lines from each perspective, it does not advance a single tradition as definitive, nor does it caricature opponents. Minor room for bias could lie in the emphasis on particular historical arguments (e.g., gifts continuing beyond the apostolic age), which reflects common charismatic apologetics and may be interpreted as more sympathetic to that view, but overall the treatment remains respectful, descriptive, and inclusive of diverse theological voices within the broader Christian spectrum."
