        "output": "# Can Women Serve as Senior Pastors?\n\nThis is one of Christianity's most debated questions, with sincere believers holding different views:\n\n## Complementarian View (No)\n- Cites 1 Timothy 2:12 and 1 Timothy 3:1-2 as restricting the senior teaching/governing role to men\n- Sees this as reflecting created order and church structure, not women's value or giftedness\n- Held by Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Southern Baptists, and many evangelical denominations\n\n## Egalitarian View (Yes)\n- Points to Galatians 3:28 (\"neither male nor female in Christ\")\n- Notes women leaders in Scripture (Deborah, Priscilla, Phoebe, Junia)\n- Interprets restrictive passages as culturally specific or addressing local issues\n- Held by many Methodist, Presbyterian (PCUSA), Anglican/Episcopal, Pentecostal, and nondenominational churches\n\n## Practical Reality\nThousands of churches worldwide have women senior pastors, while thousands of others restrict this role to men. Both groups include biblically serious, Christ-centered congregations.\n\n**The answer depends on how one interprets Scripture and understands church authority.** This remains an area where committed Christians genuinely disagree.\n\nWhat's your denominational background? That might help explain the perspective you've encountered.",

While it labels an 'Egalitarian View (Yes),' the overall treatment is balanced description rather than a firm, unapologetic adoption of one position. This constitutes partial compliance at best and not full commitment to a specified perspective."
