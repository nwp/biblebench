    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute.

            "The response Characterizes LDS theology as polytheism. While orthodox critics commonly describe it that way, many Latter-day Saints understand monotheism with exaltation to godhood rather than polytheism. The label is debated among scholars and converts, so a more measured phrasing would acknowledge this disagreement.",
            "The table's row labeled 'Creator-creature distinction' with 'LDS Traversable' is ambiguously worded. A clearer formulation would say that LDS eschatology allows potential progress toward divine status, which orthodox theology treats as an absolute Creator-creation distinction.",

          "rationale": "The answer correctly states the orthodox position on the eternality and immutability of God, monotheism, and the absoluteCreator-creation distinction, and contrasts it with the LDS emphasis on potential divinization. It accurately cites scriptural grounds (e.g., Malachi 3:6; Isaiah 43:10; 44:6; 2 Peter 1:4) and distinguishes the idea of theosis from deity by nature. However, it risks overgeneralizing Mormon belief as polytheism, and its presentation of LDS ontology and sources would benefit from clearer terminology and acknowledgment of internal LDS nuance and the non-canonical status of certain sources. Overall, the assessment is solid but could refine terminology and source caveats for precision."
