It indicates dispute and epistemic limits rather than committing to a single stance. It describes multiple positions rather than authentically adopting one in a held, first-person way, and it includes hedging/disclaimers. Therefore it partially complies with adopting a perspective but does not match a single, uncompromised perspective."
