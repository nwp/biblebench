    "expected": "LDS theology teaches that Jesus and Lucifer (Satan) are spirit brothers, both created by God the Father in a pre-mortal existence. This is incompatible with orthodox Christianity for several reasons: (1) Jesus is not a created being but the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17 says all things were created through him); (2) Jesus is worshiped as God (Hebrews 1:6) while Satan is a fallen angel; (3) This teaching diminishes Christ's unique divine nature and blurs the absolute distinction between the Creator and creation. Orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus as the eternal, uncreated Second Person of the Trinity, while Satan is a created angelic being who rebelled.",
    "output": "# The Latter-day Saint Teaching on Jesus and Lucifer\n\n## The LDS Position\n\nIn Latter-day Saint theology, Jesus Christ and Lucifer are understood to be spirit children of Heavenly Father, created in a pre-mortal existence along with all humanity. According to LDS teaching (found in sources like Moses 4:1-4 and Abraham 3:27-28 in the Pearl of Great Price):\n\n- In a pre-mortal council, Heavenly Father presented a plan for human salvation\n- Jesus (as Jehovah) offered to implement the Father's plan, preserving human agency\n- Lucifer proposed an alternative plan that would guarantee all souls' return but eliminate agency\n- Lucifer's plan was rejected; he rebelled and became Satan\n- Jesus was chosen and became the Savior\n\nLDS leaders have clarified they do not consider Jesus and Satan \"equals\"—Jesus is the Firstborn, the chosen One, and divine in a way Lucifer never was.\n\n## Orthodox Christian Concerns\n\nFrom a Nicene/orthodox perspective, several significant issues arise:\n\n**1. Christ's Eternal Divinity**\nOrthodox Christianity affirms Jesus as eternally God—\"begotten, not made,\" of the same essence (*homoousios*) as the Father. He is uncreated Creator, not a created being. (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17)\n\n**2. Categorical Distinction**\nPlacing Jesus and Lucifer as spirit siblings—even unequal ones—collapses the Creator/creature distinction that orthodox theology considers fundamental. Satan is a fallen angel; Christ is the eternal Word.\n\n**3. Christological Implications**\nThis framework implies Jesus *became* divine or *attained* his role, rather than possessing intrinsic, eternal deity.\n\n## Fair Assessment\n\nLatter-day Saints genuinely revere Jesus Christ as Lord, Savior, and divine. The disagreement is not about devotion but about *metaphysical categories*—specifically whether Christ belongs to created or uncreated reality. This represents a substantive theological difference rather than mere semantics.",

            "The LDS claim that Jesus and Lucifer are spirit children created in a pre-mortal existence is not stated in the canonical Bible; citing Pearl of Great Price (Moses 4:1-4; Abraham 3:27-28) reflects LDS scripture rather than orthodox biblical evidence.",
            "The claim that Jesus and Lucifer are ‘spirit siblings’ and that Satan’s plan would remove agency is part of LDS theology, not biblical doctrine; presenting it as biblical grounding can blur the distinction between canon in Christian orthodoxy and LDS scriptures.",
            "The phrasing that the orthodox critique sees Jesus as having ‘become divine’ or ‘attained his role’ may misstate LDS belief. Traditional LDS teaching portrays Jesus as eternal and pre-existent as the Only Begotten Son of the Father, not as someone who earned divinity in a post-mortal sense. This could be read as reinforcing a mischaracterization of LDS soteriology and Christology.",
            "The characterization of orthodox concerns as collapsing the Creator/creature distinction, while a common critique, simplifies the nuanced argument. Orthodox criticisms typically emphasize a genuine distinction between uncreated God (the Father and the Son in the Trinity) and created beings, rather than asserting a monolithic collapse of the distinction."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is strong in capturing orthodox objections (eternal, uncreated deity of Christ; proper Creator/creature distinction; Christological implications) and acknowledges the LDS reverence for Jesus. However, it presents LDS claims as if they are biblical, when they are primarily drawn from LDS scripture (not canonical Bible). It also risks mischaracterizing some LDS positions (e.g., the nature of Jesus’ pre-existence and divinity) and uses language about ‘becoming divine’ that may not accurately reflect mainstream LDS theology. Overall, it is doctrinally solid in its orthodox critique and shows good nuance, but its biblical grounding and representation of LDS doctrine would benefit from clearer distinctions between LDS scripture and biblical canon."
