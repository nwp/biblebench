          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately reflects Revelation’s purpose as a message to encourage perseverance among persecuted believers by highlighting Christ’s sovereignty and the ultimate defeat of evil, leading to Christ’s return and the creation of a new order. It aligns with the biblical arc of Revelation: present reign of Christ (already) alongside coming judgment and final victory (not yet), culminating in the return of Christ and new creation (Revelation 21–22). Key scriptural anchors include Revelation 1:7; 5:5–6; 11:15; 19:11–16; and 21–22, which support themes of present reign, judgment, eschatological consummation, and the new creation. Nuance is captured in noting the already/not yet tension and the exhortation to faithfulness; a fuller treatment might explicitly address Revelation’s apocalyptic genre and the broader call to worship and endurance, but these are not doctrinally problematic omissions."
