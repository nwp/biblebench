    "expected": "",
    "output": "From a biblical and theological standpoint, the question of sex before marriage (premarital sex) and cohabitation is one of the most significant topics of discussion in contemporary Christian ethics. While modern cultural norms regarding sexuality have shifted dramatically, the traditional historical consensus of the Church has remained consistent for two millennia.\n\nTo answer this thoroughly, we must look at the biblical texts, the theological definition of marriage, and the pastoral implications for cohabitation.\n\n### The Biblical Witness\n\nThe Bible does not contain a single verse that says, \"Thou shalt not have sex before marriage,\" using that specific modern phrasing. However, the biblical authors consistently view sexual intercourse as an act that belongs exclusively within the covenant of marriage.\n\n**1. The Definition of Sexual Immorality (*Porneia*)**\nThe most frequent biblical prohibition against premarital sex is found in the New Testament use of the Greek word *porneia*. This term is often translated as \"sexual immorality\" or \"fornication.\" It is an umbrella term that encompasses all sexual activity outside the bounds of heterosexual marriage.\n\nIn the Apostle Paul’s letters, he repeatedly commands believers to flee from *porneia*.\n*   **1 Corinthians 6:18:** \"Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.\"\n*   **Acts 15:29:** In the early Church's decree regarding Gentile converts, they instructed them to \"abstain from... sexual immorality.\"\n\n**2. The Union of \"One Flesh\"**\nThe theology of sex is rooted in Genesis. Jesus reaffirms the creation mandate in **Matthew 19:4-6**, quoting Genesis: \"He who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.'\"\n\nScripture presents the \"one flesh\" union not merely as a physical act, but as a profound spiritual and covenantal bonding. Because sex creates this bond, the Bible reserves it for the safety and permanence of the marriage covenant. **Hebrews 13:4** underscores this: \"Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled.\"\n\n**3. The Sanctity of the Body**\nPaul’s theology in **1 Corinthians 6:12-20** argues that because our bodies are members of Christ and temples of the Holy Spirit, we have no right to unite them with a prostitute (or, by extension, anyone outside of the covenant). The logic is that sexual union involves a transfer of life and identity that is meant for exclusivity.\n\n### Cohabitation: \"Trial Marriage\" or Temptation?\n\nCohabitation (living together before marriage) presents a slightly different, though related, issue. While cohabitation does not inherently involve sexual activity, sociological data confirms that the vast majority of cohabiting couples are sexually active.\n\nFrom a traditional Christian perspective, cohabitation is problematic for several reasons:\n\n*   **The Appearance of Evil:** 1 Thessalonians 5:22 instructs believers to \"abstain from every form of evil.\" Living together creates an unavoidable assumption of sexual intimacy by the surrounding community, potentially damaging the Christian witness.\n*   **The Nature of Commitment:** Biblical marriage is a covenant (a binding, public vow) before God and the community. Cohabitation is often viewed as a \"consumer\" relationship—it is conditional and based on convenience. Theologically, Christians argue that the security of the covenant marriage relationship is the necessary context for the vulnerability required in sexual intimacy.\n*   **The \"Trial\" Argument:** Many couples cohabit to \"test\" compatibility. Christian ethicists often counter this by noting that marriage is not merely about compatibility, but about *covenant faithfulness*. You cannot practice \"covenant\" while reserving the right to leave; the commitment itself creates the safety that fosters love.\n\n### Differing Christian Perspectives\n\nWhile the historic Christian position is clear, different traditions articulate the pastoral application differently:\n\n**1. The Roman Catholic View**\nCatholic theology teaches the \"Theology of the Body,\" emphasizing that sex is a total gift of self that must be free, total, faithful, and fruitful. Therefore, sex outside marriage (and contraception within marriage) is viewed as a violation of the unitive and procreative nature of sex. Cohabitation is generally prohibited as it creates a scandal and lacks the sacramental bond.\n\n**2. The Evangelical & Protestant View**\nThese traditions uphold the sanctity of sex within marriage as outlined above. However, there is often a strong emphasis on grace and restoration. While the standard is holiness and abstinence, evangelicals generally acknowledge that failure in this area does not sever one from God's grace. They stress \"purity\" not just as a rule, but as a way of honoring God with one's body.\n\n**3. The Liberal/Progressive View**\nSome mainline Protestant denominations have begun to shift their ethics. While not necessarily dismissing the biblical text entirely, they often interpret it through a cultural lens. They may prioritize \"loving, committed relationships\" over the legal status of marriage. In these circles, cohabitation is often seen as a step toward marriage, and sexual ethics are framed around consent, love, and mutual respect rather than strictly the marriage license. However, this view remains a minority within the broader scope of global Christianity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a comprehensive reading of Scripture and the weight of Christian history, the answer to your question is that **sex before marriage is considered sinful (a violation of God's design), and cohabitation is discouraged.**\n\nThe Bible views sex as a unique \"one flesh\" union designed to function within the security of a lifelong covenant. Removing sex from that context is viewed as damaging to the individuals involved (emotionally and spiritually) and dishonoring to God.\n\nHowever, it is vital to add a pastoral nuance: The Christian message is not one of condemnation but of redemption. The Church is filled with people who have failed in this area. The goal of teaching this theology is not to induce shame, but to guide believers toward the flourishing that God intends for human relationships—relationships built on the firm foundation of covenant commitment rather than temporary circumstance.",
