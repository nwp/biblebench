    "expected": "Original sin is the doctrine that all humanity inherited a sinful nature from Adam's fall. As a result, all people are born with a inclination toward sin and are spiritually separated from God. This doesn't mean infants are guilty of actual sins, but that human nature is corrupted and inclined toward evil apart from God's grace.",
    "output": "**The Doctrine of Original Sin**  \n*An overview grounded in Scripture, patristic teaching, and the major confessional traditions of the Christian faith.*\n\n---\n\n### 1. Definition (What “Original Sin” Really Means)\n\nThe doctrine of original sin (also called *first sin*, *sin of Adam*, or *ancestral sin*) holds that all human beings inherit the *consequences* of the disobedience committed by the first human, Adam.  \nTwo interlocking facts are usually emphasized:\n\n| Fact | Explanation | Scriptural basis |\n|------|-------------|------------------|\n| **1. Inherited condition** | Every human is born in a “state” marked by a sinful disposition, a propensity toward deviation from God’s will, and an inability to act righteously without divine aid. | Genesis 2:16‑17 (law of choice), Romans 5:12‑18 (death and sin through one man), 1 Cor 15:21‑22 (death and resurrection). |\n| **2. Inherited guilt (in some interpretations)** | In several Western traditions the human soul is also regarded as *guilty* for Adam’s transgression and thus requires absolution. | Romans 5:12‑21, Augustine’s *de peccato originali* (“of original sin”). |\n\nIn practical terms, original sin does **not** mean that every person consciously wills to sin or that they are condemned to sin forever. Rather, it is an inherited *condition* that corrupts human reason, will, and nature, leaving people incapable of fully complying with God’s law or of truly loving Him without rescue.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Biblical Roots\n\n#### A. Old Testament Foundations\n1. **Genesis 2–3** (The Fall) – Adam and Eve’s disobedience introduces sin and death, “all flesh” (Adam’s descendants) will die (Gen 3:19).  \n2. **Psalm 51:5** – “I was in innocence when I was created… but the sin of all nations was in me.”  \n3. **Isaiah 59:2‑3** – “Your transgressions have made a gap…” God’s justice is upset by the collective sin of Israel.  \nThese passages point to a “gap” or “transgression” that affects humanity's relationship with God.\n\n#### B. New Testament Confirmation\n1. **Romans 5:12‑21** – Paul explicitly links Adam’s single act to “death” and “sin” in all men; justification (God’s favor) is made possible through Jesus.  \n2. **1 Corinth 15:22** – “For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all are made alive.”  \n3. **2 Corinth 5:19** – The Lord was reconciling us to God “through Christ, who made ourselves a by‑treaty of reconciliation.”  \nThese texts affirm that sin introduced a problem that transcends individual acts.\n\n#### C. Theological Terms in Scripture\nA few key terms:\n\n- **Law** (῾ος νόμος): The moral expectation set by God; \"in Adam’s sin, death entered the law\" (Romans 5:14).  \n- **Death** (θάνατος): Both physical mortality and spiritual death; “Adam has given birth to death” (Hebrew 4:15).  \n- **Grace** (χάρις): The divine gift that counters the sinful state.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Historical Development\n\n| Era | Key Thought | Primary Sources |\n|-----|-------------|-----------------|\n| **Patristic (2nd–4th c.)** | Augustine articulates *original sin*—a “transgression” that infects the human nature inherited from Adam. | Augustine, *De peccato originali* (on original sin); *Confessions* I–IV. |\n| **Middle Ages** | Scholastic refinement: “original sin” treated as a defect in created nature, not as a guilt inherited through memory. | Boethius, *The Consolation of Philosophy*; Thomas Aquinas, *Summa Theologiae* (I–II). |\n| **Reformation** | Martin Luther and John Calvin emphasize the *total depravity* and *inherited guilt* of humans, thereby affirming the necessity of Christ’s atonement. | Luther, *Table Talk*; Calvin, *Institutes of the Christian Religion* (Book II). |\n| **Post‑Reformation** | The Thirty‑Septenary Confession codifies the doctrine for Lutheranism; the Westminster Confession for Presbyterians; the Catholic canon law maintains both guilt and state. | 1689 Westminster Confession; 1689 Article III; Vatican Code of Canon Law. |\n\n| Tradition | Emphasis |\n|-----------|----------|\n| Catholicism | Original sin is a *defect* of the human nature (deprivation of original holiness) and a *guilt* passed down by Adam; infant baptism removes the guilt, though the defect is dealt with through the sacramental life. |\n| Lutheranism | \"In Adam’s sin all men have inherited original sin\" and \"the whole body is sinful.\" Stress on the *unconditional nature* of sin. |\n| Reformed (Calvinist) | Full *total depravity* and *inherited guilt*; salvation is solely by grace. |\n| Arminian / Methodism | God’s grace works as *prevenient grace* – people have a “free will,” but still a sinful inclination; original sin is a *condition* not a “depravity.” |\n| Baptists / Evangelicals | Emphasize both inherited sinfulness and the necessity of a *personal* confession of faith and *baptism out of repentance*. Less focus on the inherited *guilt*. |\n| Eastern Orthodoxy | Uses the concept of *ancestral sin* (προκατάλημμα) to describe inherited mortality and moral sinfulness, but rejects the idea of inherited guilt per se, emphasizing the *restoration* of the image of God through Christ. |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Theological Core Points\n\n#### A. *Nature vs. State vs. Condition*\n- **Nature**: The fundamental human nature that was *perfectly created* but lost the original holiness (inherited “defect”).  \n- **State**: The state in which all people find themselves due to the broken chain between God and humanity.  \n- **Condition**: A persistent condition that humanity faces when trying to uphold God’s standard.\n\n#### B. *Effects of Original Sin*\n1. **Physical death** – All creatures die; Adam’s death marked all humanity (Ecclesiastes 12:7).  \n2. **Spiritual death** – Separation from God; inability to love the divine.  \n3. **Corruption of the will** – Inclination toward sin (sinner → sinful actions).  \n4. **Impaired moral cognition** – While moral knowledge exists, it is clouded by sin (Romans 5:15).\n\n#### C. *Christ’s Redemption Work*\n- **Atonement**: Christ’s death on the cross satisfies the *penalty* for sine (Justice) and fulfills the covenantal demands; the rapture of Old Covenant is replaced by Christ’s ransom.  \n- **Justification**: By faith, believers are declared righteous, with the righteousness of Christ imputed to them.  \n- **Sanctification**: The ongoing renewing of the believer by the Spirit, overcoming original sin over time.  \n- **Incorporation into the Body of Christ** (Ephesians 2:19-22) as a new family, breaking the “gap” from the Fall.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Variations and Misconceptions\n\n| Issue | Explanation | Scriptural Clarification |\n|-------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| **Do we inherit the sin itself?** | The doctrine does *not* say we have Adam’s personal act, but a disposition that undermines our moral faculties. | Romans 5:12: “But the sin came by one man... through all men” – “through all men” is the *effect*, not a memetic inheritance. |\n| **Does every sin we commit compound our original sin?** | Sinful deeds add to our personal guilt but do not deepen our inherited blame; original sin is inherited, while personal sin is a separate record. | Luke 3:13‑14: “It is like a man putting a new garment on a ruined one.” |\n| **Is original sin incompatible with free will?** | Many traditions assert that even with sin‑impeded will, people can choose to cooperate with grace. | 2 Corinth 5:17 – “the new man” – indicates new freedom. |\n| **Can we “recover” original sin?** | Only through the redemptive work of Christ; the *state* is removed, but humanity remains “affected” by mortality until Resurrection. | John 12:24 – “Unless a grain of wheat drops to death… it stays alone.” |\n| **Is this doctrine found in the Old Testament?** | While not as explicit, the covenantal framing of Israel’s sin (e.g., Psalm 51, Isaiah 59) suggests an inherited disobedial condition. | Exodus 32:32-33 “All this will be for a perpetual sin.” |\n\n---\n\n### 6. Summary\n\n1. **Original sin** is not a human personal sin but a condition inherited from Adam that corrupts human nature, introduces death both physical and spiritual, and leaves all humanity in a state of separation from God.  \n2. The **biblical support** is found predominantly in Genesis, Romans, and Corinthians, among other passages.  \n3. **Historical development** has shaped this doctrine into distinct theological emphases within Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed, Orthodox, and Evangelical traditions.  \n4. Its **core import** is that humanity can only be restored to communion with God through Christ’s atonement and that the believer’s life involves ongoing growth past the effects of that original condition.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, we capture the essence of the doctrine across the diverse spectrum of Christian interpretation while grounding it firmly in Scripture and early church teaching.",

(7) The Old Testament–New Testament linkage is sometimes accurate but the explanation of “law” and “death” in Romans 5 is simplified and partly misleading. (8) The historical-development section uses an incorrect label: “Thirty-Septenary Confession” should be the Thirty-Nine Articles; some claims about Catholic law and the nature of guilt vs. state are presented inconsistently. (9) The claim that Augustine/Scholastic positions are summarized with “guilt” vs. “defect” is oversimplified and sometimes inaccurate (e.g., Augustine’s view on original sin as more than mere “defect”). (10) Variations section includes a misapplication of Luke 3:13–14 and a confusing note about “prevenient grace” in Arminian/Methodist contexts that risks conflating distinct theological lines.
