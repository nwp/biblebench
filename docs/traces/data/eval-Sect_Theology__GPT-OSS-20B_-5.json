    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity affirms the bodily, physical resurrection of Jesus as essential to the faith (1 Corinthians 15:14). Jesus appeared in a physical body that could be touched (Luke 24:39, John 20:27), ate food (Luke 24:42-43), and still bore the crucifixion wounds. The empty tomb accounts confirm the body was gone because Jesus was raised, not that it was discarded. Jesus explicitly denied being merely a spirit: 'a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have' (Luke 24:39). The physical resurrection guarantees believers' future bodily resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:20-23) and validates Jesus' victory over death. Denying the physical resurrection undermines the gospel.",
    "output": "**Orthodox (Historic) Christian Teaching about the Resurrection of Jesus**\n\n| Doctrine | Canonical Basis | Development in Early Church |\n|----------|-----------------|------------------------------|\n| **Jesus truly died on the cross** – a real, physical death. | *Mark 15:37–38*; *Luke 23:46* | Accepted by all early Fathers (e.g., Clement of Rome, Irenaeus). |\n| **The physical body was buried** – the tomb contained his body, not a mere “spirit.” | *Mark 15:42–47* | Reaffirmed by early Fathers; the tomb is consistently described as a body’s resting place. |\n| **The body was physically resurrected** – the same body that died was restored to life in a new, glorified form. | *1 Cor 15:3‑4, 20‑24*; *John 20:1‑18*; *Acts 2:22* | The “Resurrection of the Dead” was a central point at the first Council of Nicaea (325 AD) and later at the councils of Chalcedon, Lateran, and Vatican I/II. |\n| **The resurrected body is bodily and tangible** – the resurrected Christ could be touched (e.g., the broken heel on Christ’s foot *John 20:4*; the apostles’ physical communion *1 Cor 15:20–28*). | *John 20:4–9*; *Acts 1:9‑11*; *1 Cor 15:22* | The concept of a “glorified” body is articulated by the early Fathers (e.g., Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa) and is a cornerstone of the doctrine of the bodily resurrection of all Christians (Roman 6:9; 2 Cor 5:1). |\n| **Christ’s resurrection is the \"first\" resurrection, the pattern for all believers**. | *1 Cor 15:20‑28* | This is a theological keystone: **Jesus resurrects first, so that all who believe will also be resurrected**. |\n\n---\n\n### 1. What the Orthodox View Says About the Body\n\n- **Not “disposed of”** – there was no physical demolition. The tomb was opened, and Jesus *rose* in a body that could be recognized by his disciples (see *John 20:18* and the “broken heel” story).\n\n- **Body, not spirit, returned** – The resurrection was not an elevation to a purely spiritual realm, but a transformation of the body into “glorious” or “perfect” form. Scripture says the body will no longer suffer or die (cf. *1 Cor 15:42–44*). “Spirit creature” is a Gnostic stereotype, not a New‑Testament teaching.\n\n- **Physical, tangible nature** – The resurrected Christ could be touched, eaten (the fish in *Matthew 14:14*), and later on be placed on the second (trans‑figuration) mountain (cf. *Matthew 17:1‑8*). The body of Christ, though glorified, remained *body*.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Scriptural Passages Supporting a Physical Resurrection\n\n| Passage | What it teaches |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| **1 Cor 15:3‑4** | \"Christ died for our sins...\" – the *body* was crucial to this death. |\n| **1 Cor 15:20‑24** | “Christ is firstborn from the dead; then at the last he will bring all those whom God has saved back to a *body* (spirit vs. body is explicitly contrasted). |\n| **John 20:1‑18** | After the crucifixion, the body was in the tomb until the morning when the disciples discovered it empty; the women found the *body* itself. |\n| **Acts 2:22** | Peter: “Christ was a man of whom God raised from the dead; that, we would say, a body turned into a living thing.” |\n| **Heb 11:27** | “In the morning, the world was brought out of the darkness” – implies a *body* re‑created. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Why Jehovah’s Witnesses’ View is Considered Departing\n\n| Issue | Jehovah’s Witness Teaching | Orthodox Counter‑point |\n|-------|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n| Nature of the Resurrection | The body simply “was taken away” – Jesus returned “as a spirit creature.” | Scripture speaks of a *bodily* resurrection (see above). |\n| Role of Jesus’ Body | Jesus’ body did not “recover” – the resurrection was purely spiritual. | The Body was *restored*, as described in Peter’s preaching and in the physical appearances recorded by the apostles. |\n| Meaning of “Spirit Creature” | A created being (under God’s sovereign order). | Christ is *God the Son*, full deity and full humanity; his “new body” is glorified not *created* but *re‑created* from his own divine nature. |\n| Resurrection of the Dead | There is no bodily resurrection for humanity – only for the righteous. | Doctrine: all *humans* will be resurrected into glorious bodies (Romans 6:9; 1 Cor 15:24‑28). |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Why the Physical Resurrection Matters to Orthodox Christianity\n\n1. **Affirms Christ’s Humanity** – If Christ were not bodily resurrected, he could not be “fully human” (Heb 2:14‑17; 1 Cor 15:3‑8). The *body* carries the mark of his sinful humanity; thus its restoration demonstrates that humanity has been redeemed.\n\n2. **Affirms the Trinity** – Only a *bodily* resurrection can be fully comprehended by human flesh. The Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) is fundamentally a *body*‑based reality (God “in the flesh” – *John 1:14*).\n\n3. **Provides Hope for Believers** – The promise *“of their bodies’ resurrection”* is a tangible assurance for Christians (see *1 Cor 15:20*). A purely spiritual resurrection would leave human bodies in a liminal condition.\n\n4. **Sustains Christ’s Role as Mediator** – The priest‑prophet‑soldier’s function (*Matthew 26:63-65; John 18:33–37*) requires a physical body to intercede in human terms.\n\n5. **Culminates the Kingdom** – The bodily resurrection sets the stage for the “New Jerusalem” and the “body of the Messiah” rising to “the throne of his glorious power” (cf. *Revelation 21:4*).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Summary Statement\n\nOrthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus **did** die bodily, was buried, and that **God raised him from the dead in a physical, glorified body**. This bodily resurrection affirms Jesus’ full humanity and divinity, establishes the doctrine of the bodily resurrection for all believers, and provides the theological anchor for the church’s hope of eternal life. The idea that Jesus was merely “disposed of” and re‑appeared as a “spirit creature” departs from the Scriptures and the foundational doctrines that have shaped the church from the earliest councils onward. It is a perspective that aligns with the theological thinking of Jehovah’s Witnesses but rests outside the historic, orthodox Christian understanding of the Resurrection.",
