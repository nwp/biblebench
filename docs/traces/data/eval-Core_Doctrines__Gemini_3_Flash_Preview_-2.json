    "input": "Explain justification by faith. How does someone become righteous before God?",
    "expected": "Justification by faith is the doctrine that sinners are declared righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus Christ, not by their own works or merit. It is a legal declaration by God where the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, and their sins are forgiven. This justification is received through faith alone (sola fide), by grace alone (sola gratia), based on Christ's finished work alone (solus Christus).",
    "output": "In Christian systematic theology, **Justification by faith** is the judicial act of God whereby He declares a guilty sinner to be righteous in His sight. It is fundamentally a legal declaration (forensic) rather than a moral transformation.\n\nTo understand how someone becomes righteous before God, we must examine the concept through four primary categories: the problem, the ground, the means, and the result.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Problem: The Divine Dilemma\nThe necessity of justification arises from two biblical realities: the absolute holiness of God and the total depravity of humanity.\n*   **The Standard:** God’s law demands perfect conformity to His character (Matthew 5:48).\n*   **The Human Condition:** Because of the Fall, all humans are born in sin and are \"by nature children of wrath\" (Ephesians 2:3). Romans 3:23 concludes that \"all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\"\n\nTherefore, humanity faces a legal crisis: God is a \"just judge\" who cannot simply overlook sin (Exodus 34:7). If He were to declare a sinner righteous without a legal basis, He would cease to be just.\n\n### 2. The Ground: The Work of Christ\nHow can God remain just while justifying the ungodly? The answer lies in the **Active and Passive Obedience of Jesus Christ.**\n\nJustification is not based on the sinner's inherent goodness, but on an \"alien righteousness\"—a righteousness that comes from outside ourselves. This involves **Double Imputation**:\n*   **Imputation of Sin:** On the cross, the sins of the believer were imputed (legally transferred) to Christ. He suffered the \"passive obedience\" of enduring the penalty the law required (2 Corinthians 5:21).\n*   **Imputation of Righteousness:** In return, the perfect lifelong obedience of Christ—His \"active obedience\"—is imputed to the believer.\n\nWhen God looks at the justified person, He does not see their sin; He sees the perfect record of His Son. As Romans 5:19 states, \"by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.\"\n\n### 3. The Means: Faith Alone (*Sola Fide*)\nIf Christ’s work is the *ground* of justification, **faith** is the *instrumental cause*. \n\n*   **Not a Work:** Faith is not a \"good work\" that earns salvation. If faith were a merit, justification would be a reward, not a gift.\n*   **An Empty Hand:** Theologians often describe faith as the \"empty hand\" that receives the gift. It is a turning away from self-reliance and a resting entirely upon the person and work of Jesus Christ.\n*   **The Objects of Faith:** Saving faith involves knowledge (*notitia*), agreement (*assensus*), and personal trust (*fiducia*).\n\nPaul clarifies in Romans 4:5: \"And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness.\"\n\n### 4. The Result: Peace and Assurance\nThe immediate result of justification is a change in status, not necessarily a change in internal feeling.\n*   **Peace with God:** \"Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\" (Romans 5:1). The hostility between the Creator and the creature is ended.\n*   **No Condemnation:** There is no longer any legal charge that can be brought against the believer (Romans 8:1, 33-34).\n*   **Adoption:** While justification is a legal term, it leads immediately to the relational reality of adoption into God’s family.\n\n### Summary: Justification vs. Sanctification\nTo maintain theological clarity, it is vital to distinguish justification from **sanctification**:\n*   **Justification** is an instantaneous act; **Sanctification** is a lifelong process.\n*   **Justification** happens *outside* of us (a change in status); **Sanctification** happens *inside* of us (a change in character).\n*   **Justification** is the root; **Sanctification** is the fruit.\n\nIn the famous words of the Reformers: **\"We are justified by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone.\"** True justification will inevitably produce a life of good works, but those works are the evidence of righteousness, not the cause of it.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately presents justification by faith in a way consistent with classical Protestant orthodoxy and biblical teaching. It correctly treats justification as a forensic (legal) declaration, grounded in Christ’s work, and received by faith apart from works. It includes key biblical texts and concepts: not imputing sins to believers but imputing Christ’s righteousness (double imputation), the active and passive obedience of Christ, and the role of faith as the instrumental cause not a meritorious work. It distinguishes justification from sanctification, notes peace with God and adoption as benefits, and reflects the Reformers’ maxim that justification is by faith alone though genuine faith evidences itself in good works. Nuance is present in not minimizing the necessity of union with Christ or the transformation that follows, and it acknowledges faith’s notitia/assensus/fiducia aspects. Potential caveats (not errors) include that some traditions differ on how exactly imputation and obedience operate within salvation (e.g., some Arminian or Catholic frameworks), and the responseframes these ideas within a Reformed/forensic schema, which is a legitimate but not universal perspective. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced.)"

          "heresies_detected": [],
          "explanation": "Overall, the response presents orthodox Christian teaching on justification by faith (sola fide) in a classic Protestant/Reformed framework. Key points align with historic doctrine: forensic (legal) justification, the problem of human sin before a holy God, the ground in Christ’s passive and active obedience (double imputation), and the means of faith as the instrument rather than a meritorious work. It also correctly distinguishes justification from sanctification and notes the relational reality of adoption as a consequence of salvation.\n\nSpecific observations:\n- Forensic justification and alien righteousness: The description of imputation (sin imputed to Christ; righteousness imputed to the believer) matches traditional formulations and is widely held in historic Protestant theology.\n- Ground and means: Distinguishing ground (Christ’s work) from means (faith) and arguing that faith is not a merit but an empty hand receiving Christ is standard in classical sola fide discussions.\n- Notitia, assensus, fiducia: The delineation of knowledge, assent, and trust (notitia-assensus-fiducia) is a well-established way to describe saving faith.\n- The role of faith and assurance: The statements about peace with God, no condemnation, and adoption are consistent with biblical teaching and typical confessional summaries.\n\nPotential clarifications or caveats (not errors, but worth noting for precision):\n- The language of “alien righteousness” and “double imputation” is traditional in Reformed theology. Some Catholic and Eastern Orthodox writers emphasize the transformation of the person (infused grace, sanctification) as more integral to justification than this purely forensic emphasis. The text does acknowledge a distinction between justification and sanctification, but readers from other traditions may prefer formulations that foreground transformation alongside forensic status.\n- The statement that justification is “outside of us” is a helpful summary of the forensic nature but could be complemented by noting the inseparable union with Christ in whom believers are placed, as many orthodox theologians emphasize the objective union that grounds subjective experience.\n- “Faith alone” is affirmed, and the text carefully notes that faith is not a meritorious work. Some readers might want explicit acknowledgment that faith itself is granted by grace and that the believer’s ongoing perseverance is also dependent on divine grace (a topic where different traditions nuance the role of grace and human response).\n\nOverall assessment: no heresy detected; the content is at a none-to-minor level of potential ambiguity related to traditional formulations. The severity is none, with suggested clarifications primarily for cross-traditional precision rather than doctrinal correction."
