    "output": "### To whom was Romans written?\n\n**Paul’s Letter to the Romans** was written **to the Christian congregations in Rome**—a network of house churches made up of **both Gentile (non-Jewish) and Jewish believers** (Romans 1:7, 1:13; 16:3–16). Paul addresses them as “all God’s beloved in Rome, who are called to be saints” (Rom 1:7), indicating a broad audience across the Roman Christian community rather than a single local congregation.\n\n**Historical context:** By the mid–first century, Rome’s churches likely included many **Gentiles**, especially after the **expulsion of Jews from Rome under Emperor Claudius (c. AD 49)** and the later return of Jewish residents after Claudius’s death (AD 54). This created tensions and questions about Jewish and Gentile identity in the church—issues Romans speaks to repeatedly (e.g., Romans 9–11; 14–15). (Acts 18:2 reflects the Claudian expulsion.)\n\n### Why was Romans written?\n\nPaul wrote Romans for several connected purposes:\n\n1. **To present and clarify his gospel message**\n   - Romans is Paul’s fullest sustained explanation of the gospel: **human sin**, **justification by faith**, the role of the **law**, life in the **Spirit**, and God’s plan for **Jews and Gentiles** (Romans 1–8; 9–11).\n   - He had not yet visited Rome, so the letter functions as a careful introduction of his teaching and mission (Rom 1:10–15; 15:22–24).\n\n2. **To unite Jewish and Gentile believers and address tensions**\n   - Paul stresses that **both Jews and Gentiles are under sin** and that salvation is through **faith in Christ**, not ethnic privilege or law-keeping (Rom 3–4).\n   - He urges mutual acceptance and peace on disputed practices (food laws, holy days), aiming for unity (Rom 14–15).\n\n3. **To prepare the Roman church for his planned visit and future mission to Spain**\n   - A key practical reason: Paul intended to travel to Rome and then onward to **Spain**, hoping the Roman Christians would support him materially and logistically (Rom 15:24, 28–29).\n\n4. **To secure understanding and support while he delivered a major collection to Jerusalem**\n   - Paul was about to take a financial gift from Gentile churches to the poor in Jerusalem, a politically and socially sensitive act intended to express unity between Gentile and Jewish believers (Rom 15:25–27, 30–31).\n\n### Authorship note (brief scholarly context)\nThe **traditional and majority scholarly view** is that **the apostle Paul** authored Romans. It is also widely held that he **dictated the letter** to a scribe named **Tertius** (Rom 16:22). Romans is commonly dated to **the mid-to-late 50s (often c. AD 57–58)**, likely written from **Corinth** near the end of Paul’s third missionary journey (cf. Rom 15:25–26; 16:1, 16:23).",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately identifies the recipients of Romans as the Christian church in Rome, a diverse community of Gentile and Jewish believers (Rom 1:7; 16:3–16). It correctly notes the historical context involving Gentile/Jewish tensions and the Claudian expulsion of Jews from Rome (Acts 18:2), a commonly cited background for the letter. It clearly outlines the main purposes of Romans: to present and clarify the gospel (including topics like sin, justification by faith, the law, life in the Spirit, and Jew/Gentile salvation), to address unity and practical issues among Jewish and Gentile believers (e.g., Romans 14–15), to prepare for Paul’s visit to Rome and his planned mission to Spain (Rom 15:24, 28–29), and to secure support for the Jerusalem collection (Rom 15:25–27, 30–31). It also provides the traditional scholarly context: Paul as author, the possible dictation to Tertius (Rom 16:22), and dating to the mid–late 50s AD from Corinth (Rom 15:25–26; 16:1, 23). The response presents a balanced view without overstating uncertainty and covers the key factual elements relevant to the question. Minor refinements could note that Romans may have circulated among multiple networks beyond a single church, but this does not undermine the overall accuracy for the question asked."
