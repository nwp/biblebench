    "output": "### To whom was Romans written?\n\n**Romans was written by the apostle Paul to the Christian believers in Rome**—a network of house churches made up of **both Gentile and Jewish Christians** (Romans 1:7; 16:3–16). The letter assumes a predominantly **Gentile** audience in places (e.g., Romans 1:5–6; 11:13), while also addressing **Jewish concerns** and extensive use of the Hebrew Scriptures, indicating a mixed community.\n\n**Historical setting:** Most scholars place the letter around **A.D. 57–58**, written from **Corinth** near the end of Paul’s third missionary journey (based on Romans 15:25–26 and the travel notes in Romans 16; also consistent with Acts 20). Authorship is overwhelmingly attributed to **Paul**, with **Tertius** serving as his scribe (Romans 16:22).\n\n---\n\n### Why was Romans written?\n\nPaul wrote Romans for several connected purposes:\n\n1. **To introduce himself and his “gospel” to a church he did not found**\n   Paul had not yet visited Rome (Romans 1:10–13). He writes a full, carefully argued presentation of his message about **God’s righteousness**, **justification by faith**, and the implications for life in Christ (Romans 1–8).\n\n2. **To unite a divided or tension-filled mixed congregation (Jewish and Gentile believers)**\n   After the emperor Claudius expelled Jews from Rome (c. A.D. 49) and they later returned, tensions likely arose about Torah observance, identity, and status within the church. Romans repeatedly addresses:\n   - the equal sinfulness of all (Romans 1–3),\n   - salvation available to all through Christ (Romans 3–5),\n   - and mutual acceptance across “strong/weak” differences (Romans 14–15).\n   Romans 9–11 especially explains **how Israel and the Gentiles fit together in God’s plan**, countering arrogance and promoting humility and unity (Romans 11:17–24).\n\n3. **To gain support for his planned mission to Spain**\n   Paul intends to travel to **Spain** and hopes the Roman churches will assist him (Romans 15:22–24, 28–29). Romans functions partly as a **missionary support letter**—establishing trust, explaining his theology, and building partnership.\n\n4. **To ask for prayer and support regarding a sensitive Jerusalem relief mission**\n   Paul is on his way to deliver a collection to the believers in Jerusalem (Romans 15:25–27) and asks the Romans to pray for his safety and for acceptance of the gift (Romans 15:30–31). This also ties into his larger aim of Jewish-Gentile unity within the wider church.\n\n---\n\n### In summary\n**Romans was written to the Christian communities in Rome** (a mixed Jewish-Gentile church) **to present Paul’s gospel clearly, promote unity across ethnic and religious divides, and enlist the Roman believers’ partnership**—especially as he prepared to deliver aid to Jerusalem and then launch a westward mission to Spain.",

The answer remains firmly aligned with mainstream historical-critical consensus. A minor caveat is that while many scholars favor Corinth/ Greece as the writing location, some propose other locations in Greece; mentioning a range rather than a single city would reflect that ongoing debate more explicitly, but it does not substantially affect the core factual accuracy.}"
