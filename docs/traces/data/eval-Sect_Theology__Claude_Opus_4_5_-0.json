    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "# Theological Analysis: The Lorenzo Snow Couplet\n\n## The Teaching in Context\n\nThis statement, known as the \"Lorenzo Snow couplet,\" encapsulates the Latter-day Saint doctrine of **eternal progression** and **theosis/exaltation**. It makes two claims:\n1. God the Father was once a mortal being like humans\n2. Humans can progress to become like God (deification)\n\n---\n\n## Comparison with Orthodox Christian Theology\n\n### Areas of Significant Departure\n\n**On God's Nature:**\n\nOrthodox Christianity teaches that God is:\n- **Eternally God** — never having been otherwise (Psalm 90:2: \"from everlasting to everlasting, you are God\")\n- **Ontologically distinct** from creation — God is uncreated, self-existent (*aseity*)\n- **Immutable** in His divine nature (Malachi 3:6; James 1:17)\n\nThe first half of the couplet (\"God once was as man now is\") represents a fundamental departure from Nicene Christianity, which confesses God as eternally divine, not a progressed or exalted being.\n\n**On Creation vs. Creator:**\n\nTraditional Christianity maintains an **absolute ontological distinction** between Creator and creature. God creates *ex nihilo*; creatures are contingent beings. The LDS framework suggests a continuity of species between God and humanity that classical theism rejects.\n\n---\n\n### An Area of Partial Resonance\n\n**The concept of theosis/deification:**\n\nThe *second* half of the couplet finds *surface-level* resonance with the Eastern Orthodox doctrine of **theosis** and the patristic teaching (Athanasius, Irenaeus) that \"God became man so that man might become god.\"\n\n**However, critical distinctions exist:**\n\n| Orthodox Theosis | LDS Exaltation |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Participation in God's *energies*, not essence | Becoming the same *kind* of being as God |\n| Remains creature by nature | Progression to godhood in nature |\n| One God eternally; humans share divine life by grace | Plurality of gods; humans become gods of their own worlds |\n| Grace transforms nature without changing ontological category | Ontological category itself changes |\n\nOrthodox theosis is **participatory** — humans become \"partakers of the divine nature\" (2 Peter 1:4) while remaining creatures. LDS exaltation is **progressional** — humans become Gods in the fullest sense.\n\n---\n\n## Creedal and Conciliar Standards\n\nBy the standards of:\n- The **Nicene Creed** (325/381 AD)\n- The **Chalcedonian Definition** (451 AD)\n- The **Athanasian Creed**\n\nThis teaching would be considered **heterodox** because it:\n1. Compromises divine *aseity* (self-existence)\n2. Implies a form of polytheism or henotheism\n3. Collapses the Creator-creature distinction\n\n---\n\n## Respectful Conclusion\n\nLatter-day Saints hold this teaching as revealed truth restored through Joseph Smith, and it is central to their understanding of human purpose and divine love. They would argue that post-apostolic Christianity lost these truths.\n\nFrom the standpoint of historic, creedal Christianity (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant), however, this teaching represents not a minor variation but a **different theological framework** regarding the nature of God and humanity — placing it outside the boundaries of orthodox Christian theism as historically defined.\n\nThe disagreement is substantial and should be acknowledged honestly by both traditions, even while maintaining mutual respect in dialogue.",

            "The response asserts a ‘continuity of species’ between God and humanity as characteristic of LDS belief. While LDS teaching does involve deification and exaltation, presenting it as a biological/ontological continuity (continuity of species) risks oversimplifying and may misstate LDS anthropology slightly. In LDS discourse, the emphasis is often on exaltation, grace, and a change in glory/status rather than a literal biological continuity as understood in classic debates about essence/being.",
            "There is a tendency to frame LDS exaltation as inherently leading to polytheism or a fully shared divine essence with God. While orthodox critique rightly questions the Creator-creature distinction, some LDS interpretations emphasize qualitative similarity in glory or status rather than an exact equality of divine essence. The response could be clearer about the diversity of LDS articulations on “gods” and avoid implying a single monolithic claim beyond mainstream core statements.",
            "The discussion sometimes blends terms (e.g., “become gods of their own worlds”) with orthodox critique without distinguishing LDS nuances (eternal progression, exaltation, and the specific meanings of “god” in LDS theology) from classical polytheism. This could conflate distinct LDS concepts with broader polemics, potentially painting an oversimplified picture."
          ],
          "rationale": "The analysis overall accurately identifies the core orthodox concerns with the Lorenzo Snow couplet: God’s eternality, aseity, and immutability; the Creator-creature distinction; and theosis as participatory rather than ontological identicalness. It also correctly notes the resonance with theosis in spirit, while distinguishing the LDS view as moving toward deification in a way orthodox theology repackages as problematic. The main strengths are clear, scripture-backed points and a fair contrast between orthodox theosis and LDS exaltation. The main caveats are minormisstatements/overgeneralizations about LDS anthropology (especially about “continuity of species” and the inevitability of polytheism) which could be clarified or nuanced further. Overall, the response is solid, with slight room for more precise LDS-orthodox distinctions. "
