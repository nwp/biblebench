          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately reflects the core purpose of Revelation: to comfort and exhort persecuted believers through apocalyptic visions that affirm God’s ultimate victory over evil, the returning Christ, and the culmination of creation in a new heaven and a new earth. These elements align with biblical teaching (e.g., Rev 19–22, 21:1) and with historic Christian orthodoxy regarding final judgment and the eschaton. The inclusion of “new heaven and new earth” expands appropriately into the biblical end-state of creation, which is scripturally grounded (also echoed in 2 Pet 3:13). The answer remains faithful to the book’s aim of encouraging perseverance and faith in light of cosmic victory. Nuance is preserved by mentioning visions and the persecuted audience; it does not overstate or misinterpret the book’s purpose. A minor enhancement could acknowledge multiple interpretive approaches to Revelation, but the core accuracy is solid."
