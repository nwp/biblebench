    "output": "# Purpose of the Book of Revelation\n\n## Primary Purposes\n\nThe Book of Revelation served several interconnected purposes for its original audience and subsequent readers:\n\n### 1. **Comfort and Encouragement Under Persecution**\nRevelation was written to encourage Christians facing persecution, likely during the reign of Emperor Domitian (c. 95 AD). The book assures believers that despite present suffering, God remains sovereign and will ultimately triumph over evil.\n\n### 2. **Call to Faithful Endurance**\nThe repeated refrain \"let the one who has an ear hear\" and promises to \"those who overcome\" emphasize perseverance. The book warns against compromise with Roman imperial religion and pagan practices while encouraging believers to remain faithful even unto death.\n\n### 3. **Unveiling of Jesus Christ**\nThe opening verse describes it as \"the revelation of Jesus Christ\" - unveiling His true identity as the risen Lord, sovereign King, and coming Judge. This cosmic perspective of Christ contrasts with the earthly power of Rome.\n\n### 4. **Prophetic Warning and Hope**\nRevelation describes coming judgment on God's enemies and the ultimate establishment of God's kingdom. It assures readers that history is moving toward God's predetermined goal - a new heaven and new earth where God dwells with His people.\n\n### 5. **Worship and Doxology**\nThe book contains numerous scenes of heavenly worship, reminding readers that true worship belongs to God and the Lamb alone, not to Caesar or other earthly powers.\n\n## Contemporary Application\n\nWhile written to a specific historical context, Revelation continues to provide hope to persecuted Christians and reminds all believers of God's ultimate victory and faithful promises.",

          "rationale": "The response accurately identifies the main historical purposes commonly associated with Revelation: comfort under persecution (late 1st century, Domitian era), call to perseverance, unveiling of Christ’s identity, prophetic warnings with hope for God’s ultimate victory, and emphasis on worship. It aligns with mainstream dating (late 1st century, Domitian) and the book’s cosmic scope. Nuance is present via hedging the dating. However, it omits discussion of authorship debates and the symbolic/apocalyptic nature of the text, as well as the variety of interpretive approaches, which are relevant to a fuller contextual understanding."
