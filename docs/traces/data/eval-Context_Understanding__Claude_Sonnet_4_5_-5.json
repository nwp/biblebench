    "output": "# Purpose of the Book of Revelation\n\n## Primary Purposes\n\nThe Book of Revelation served several interconnected purposes for its original audience and the broader church:\n\n### 1. **Comfort and Encouragement During Persecution**\nWritten to seven churches in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) during a time of Roman persecution, Revelation aimed to strengthen Christians facing suffering, imprisonment, and martyrdom. It assured believers that God remained sovereign despite their circumstances.\n\n### 2. **Call to Faithful Endurance**\nThe book repeatedly urges Christians to remain faithful, resist compromise with pagan Roman culture, and persevere through trials. The recurring phrase \"he who overcomes\" emphasizes active faithfulness over passive survival.\n\n### 3. **Theological Assurance of God's Ultimate Victory**\nRevelation provides a cosmic perspective showing that despite present evil and suffering, God will ultimately triumph over Satan, evil powers, and death itself. Christ is portrayed as the victorious Lamb who has already won the decisive battle.\n\n### 4. **Warning and Correction**\nThe letters to the seven churches (chapters 2-3) address specific spiritual problems including false teaching, complacency, and moral compromise, calling churches to repentance.\n\n### 5. **Worship and Doxology**\nThe book draws readers into heavenly worship, reorienting their perspective from earthly troubles to God's throne room, emphasizing that worship is the proper response to God's character and actions.\n\n## Context\n\nMost scholars date Revelation to approximately 95-96 AD during Emperor Domitian's reign, though some argue for an earlier date around 68-70 AD during Nero's persecution.",

          "rationale": "The answer accurately identifies the main original-audience purposes of Revelation (comfort during persecution, call to endurance, assurance of God's ultimate victory, the specific warnings to the seven churches, and emphasis on worship). It also correctly notes the typical dating around 95–96 CE under Domitian, while acknowledging earlier-date proposals. The only notable gap is an explicit mention of the return of Christ, which is a standard aspect of Revelation’s eschatology, though its themes of victory and the Lamb imply this. Overall, the response is factually accurate, comprehensive, and appropriately nuanced."
