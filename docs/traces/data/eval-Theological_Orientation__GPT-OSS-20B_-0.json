    "output": "**What “inspired” means for the Bible**\n\nThe word *inspired* (Greek *ἐνσπέρμασις*, *inspiratio*) was originally used in the Greek *ὁ ἄνθρωπος κῆς* “the Holy Spirit” “breathed into” an instrument or a writer.  It conveys that the Scriptures are not merely the product of human thought or cultural memory, but are *God‑guided* works.  The idea can be understood in a few, overlapping ways:\n\n| Tradition / Text | How it is articulated | What it stresses |\n|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| **Verbal Plenary Inspiration** | “Every word of the New Testament and the whole Old Testament is the word of God.” (cf. 2 Timothy 3:16, Psalm 119:106) | The entire biblical text, word for word, is the result of the Spirit’s guidance. |\n| **Dynamic / Thematic Inspiration** | “The Holy Spirit guided the writers so that their writings could convey God’s message.” (cf. 2 Peter 1:20‑21) | Only the ideas, themes, and the essential truth are “inspired,” while the human authors’ language, style, and idiom are left to the human hand. |\n| **Traditional Orthodoxy** | The *Scriptures are the Word of God.* (Acts 17:11, 1 Timothy 2:15) | Scripture is the ultimate standard for faith and life, rooted in divine revelation, yet it is understood that the human aspect introduces the usual cultural idiosyncrasies. |\n\nIn all versions the central claim is that the **Author** of the biblical text is the Holy Spirit, *in person with* the human writers.\n\n**Does “inspired” mean “without error” in every detail?**\n\nThe answer depends on which “inspiration” is taken seriously and on how the *nature of the original inspiration* is understood.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Inerrancy (the strictest view)\n\n*Church‑wide statements*\n\n- **Westminster Confession (1646)** – “the entire written law of God is without error in all that it affirms” (chapter 27).  \n- **Baptist Conventions, Lutheran synods, many evangelical statements** echo the same inerrancy claim.\n\n*Biblical support often cited*\n\n- 2 Timothy 3:16: “All Scripture is God‑breathed (inspired) and profitable for teaching….”  \n- Psalm 119:106: “All Thy words are true (inspired); Thy faithfulness is everlasting.”  \n- 2 Peter 1:21: “No prophecy came out of man’s own will; it was a gift from God.”\n\n*Implication*  \n\nIf God Himself is perfect and unchanging, He cannot admit of error in the Word that He has given.  Therefore, a biblical text whose truth “stems from God” has no *statements of fact* that are wrong – whether they are theological, moral, historical, or scientific, because all of those facts are, in this view, handed down by the same divine mind that crafted the universe.\n\n*Criticisms*\n\n- A literal reading of Genesis (e.g., six‑day creation) conflicts with modern scientific data.\n- Many historical and textual scholars point to variations among early manuscripts (e.g., the *Western* vs. *Alexandrian* manuscripts, or differences between *Septuagint* and *Masoretic* texts) that would be difficult to reconcile with “no error at all.”\n- Inerrancy as it is usually formulated is a **doctrine** adopted by a theological tradition, not a biblical confession itself; the Bible can say that it is guided by the Spirit yet it does not explicitly use the term “error.”\n\n---\n\n### 2. Infallibility (no error when it matters for faith)\n\n*Proposed compromise*\n\nInfallibility says the Scriptures are *never* untrustworthy in the matters of faith and moral truth, i.e. in the *proclamations of God's will*—the revelation of salvation, the nature of God, and core Christian doctrines.  For mundane details—dates, names, geographic descriptions—small errors are permissible.\n\n*Scriptural bases*\n\n- 1 John 2:15, 27 – “If you would like to be known by the spirit and the truth.”  \n- 2 Peter 3:15 – “The old writings are not to be despised but the new because of the promise.”\n\n*Theological nuance*\n\n- **Catholic & Orthodox** emphasise that truth is the *essential*, but because their Scriptures function together with *Holy Tradition*, they treat the texts as *infallible* where doctrinal certainty is concerned but allow for possible historical inaccuracies.\n- **Mainline Protestantism** often embraces this view, allowing for “historical errors” while affirming that Scripture’s core claim—Jesus is Lord—is without mistake.\n\n---\n\n### 3. “Inspiration” with allowance for historical error\n\nMany contemporary scholars and theologians hold that:\n\n- The **Holy Spirit** guided the human writers; the *message* was secure, but the *medium*—the language, the idioms, and the style—was human and therefore subject to ordinary human limitations.\n\n- **Early Church Fathers** were aware that the Scriptures could contain “errors” in ordinary facts but still consider them *true and holy* for faith. For instance, Augustine (early 5th c.) wrote: “It is only a human error that there are some differences in the wording of the texts; the truth is contained in the message God has given.”\n\n- The *Biblical Text* as a *document* can possess textual variants—evident from the *Dead‑Sea Scrolls*, *Papyrus 46*, and others—but this does not threaten the revelation’s reliability for *faith* or *salvation.*\n\n- **Scientific statements**: Jesus in the Gospels says, *“the heavens tell the story of God”* (Luke 17:20‑21). The Bible’s purpose is not to be a scientific textbook; rather, it uses the language of its time to point toward divine truth.\n\n**Conclusion – A Balanced Picture**\n\n1. **At its core, “inspired” means** the Scriptures are *God’s Word*; the Holy Spirit breathed life into human writers.  \n2. **Whether that guarantees perfection in *every* historical or scientific detail** is a matter of doctrinal position:\n   * **Inerrantists** hold the word “without error” to apply to the totality of Scripture; they see any factual error as incompatible with the divine nature.  \n   * **Infallibilists** see error as possible in the *mundane* while the divine message is protected.  \n   * **Non‑inerrantist traditions** (mainline Protestants, many Catholic theologians, traditional Orthodox, some Evangelicals) maintain that the Scripture’s value lies in its revealed truth for faith and life, not in its precise historical detail.  \n3. **Theological practice**: All Christian traditions find in the Bible a command to *use it for teaching, rebuke, correcting, and training in righteousness* (2 Timothy 3:16). That instruction presumes the text’s *truth‑power* even if some factual details have textual variants.  \n4. **The human factor**: Manuscript transmission—scribes, copying errors, translation—does not change the fact that the original Word of God was inspired; it only sometimes creates differences between textual witnesses.  \n\nIn sum, stating that the Bible is “inspired” affirms that its message is God‑given. Whether that renders it *perfectly error‑free* in every statement remains a theological claim that differs across denominations. Most mainstream traditions hold that even if some historical or scientific details are imperfect, such shortcomings do not undercut the Bible’s authority for faith, salvation, and holy living.",
