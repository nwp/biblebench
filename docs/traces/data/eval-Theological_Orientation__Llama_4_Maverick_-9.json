    "expected": "",
    "output": "The Bible provides clear guidance on sexual morality and the context in which sexual activity is appropriate. The primary biblical teaching on sex before marriage is found in several passages that emphasize the importance of sexual purity and the reservation of sexual intimacy for marriage.\n\nIn the Old Testament, the law given to Israel explicitly prohibits sexual immorality, including fornication (Exodus 20:17; Leviticus 18:1-30; Deuteronomy 22:28-29). The New Testament reinforces this teaching, with Jesus affirming the creation ordinance that sexual intimacy is to be reserved for the marriage relationship (Matthew 19:4-6, quoting Genesis 2:24). The Apostle Paul explicitly condemns fornication (porneia), a term that encompasses various forms of sexual immorality including premarital sex, as incompatible with the Christian life (1 Corinthians 5:1, 6:13-20, 7:1-2; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3).\n\n1 Corinthians 7:1-2 states, \"Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: 'It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.' But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.\" This passage indicates that sexual relations are to be within the context of marriage to avoid fornication.\n\nMoreover, Hebrews 13:4 declares, \"Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.\" This verse not only emphasizes the importance of honoring marriage but also warns against defiling the marriage bed, implying that sexual activity outside of marriage is contrary to God's design.\n\nRegarding cohabitation, while the Bible does not directly address the modern concept of \"living together\" before marriage, the principles outlined in the scriptures regarding sexual purity and the nature of commitment in marriage suggest that cohabiting with the intention of testing a relationship or as a substitute for marriage is not in line with biblical teachings. Cohabitation often involves premarital sexual activity, which, as discussed, is contrary to the biblical ideal.\n\nThat being said, Christian perspectives on how to apply these teachings in contemporary contexts can vary. Some Christians interpret the biblical prohibition on fornication as a clear directive against premarital sex and thus against cohabitation that involves sexual activity. They advocate for abstinence until marriage as a way of honoring God and ensuring that their sexual relationship is sanctified within the covenant of marriage.\n\nOthers, while agreeing that the Bible teaches sexual activity should be within marriage, may recognize that not everyone has the same ability to abstain due to various circumstances. They may argue for a more nuanced application, focusing on the development of a committed, covenantal relationship that reflects the values of Christian marriage, even if the formal ceremony has not yet taken place. However, this perspective is less about endorsing cohabitation or premarital sex and more about understanding the complexities of real-life situations and the need for grace and compassion.\n\nIn practice, many Christian churches and leaders encourage young people and those considering marriage to cultivate purity, to understand the biblical view of sex and marriage, and to seek to honor God in their relationships. This includes abstaining from sexual activity outside of marriage and approaching cohabitation with caution, recognizing it may not align with biblical ideals.\n\nUltimately, the Bible teaches that sexual activity is a gift from God to be enjoyed within the context of marriage. Christians are called to uphold the biblical ideal of sexual purity and to seek to honor God in their relationships. While different Christian communities may have varying approaches to applying these teachings in complex real-life situations, the overarching biblical principle is clear: sexual intimacy is a sacred trust to be reserved for the marriage covenant.",

It repeatedly cites Scripture (Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Matthew, 1 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Hebrews) and ends with a clear principle that sexual intimacy is a sacred trust within the marriage covenant. It acknowledges some pastoral nuance and diversity of application, but these are framed as secondary or minority perspectives, not as endorsements of premarital sex or cohabitation. This emphasis on biblical authority, traditional sexual ethics, and a cautious, pastoral handling of exceptions aligns with conservative theological orientation.",

          "explanation": "The response takes a conservative, biblically grounded position by affirming that sexual activity belongs within marriage, citing narrative and prescriptive scriptures (Old and New Testament) and emphasizing abstinence and the sanctity of the marriage bed. It acknowledges differing Christian approaches: some read the prohibition on fornication as a strict directive against premarital sex and premarital cohabitation, while others allow for nuance, grace, and consideration of real-life circumstances. It discusses these alternative views fairly, then reaffirms the overarching biblical principle that sexual intimacy is a sacred trust for the marriage covenant. The tone is measured and pastoral rather than dogmatic, highlighting grace and practical application without abandoning the conservative core position."
