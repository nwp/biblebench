        "input": "Is homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "The Bible's stance on homosexuality is complex and interpreted differently across Christian denominations. Here's a breakdown of key perspectives:\n\n### Passages Often Cited\n1. **Old Testament:**\n   - **Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13**: Prohibit male same-sex relations (\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination\"). These are part of the Mosaic Law’s holiness codes, which also prohibit shellfish, mixed fabrics, and remarriage after divorce (Deuteronomy 24:1-4). Most Christians do not follow these laws today, viewing them as culturally specific or fulfilled in Christ.\n\n2. **New Testament:**\n   - **Romans 1:26-27**: Describes same-sex relations as \"unnatural\" and a consequence of rejecting God. Context is idolatry and moral decline, not orientation.\n   - **1 Corinthians 6:9-10**: Lists \"homosexual offenders\" (Greek: *arsenokoitai*) among sinners. The term is ambiguous—possibly referencing exploitative relationships (e.g., pederasty) rather than consensual same-sex unions.\n   - **1 Timothy 1:10**: Similar to 1 Corinthians, likely condemning exploitative sex acts.\n\n### Key Interpretive Perspectives\n- **Traditional View**: Many evangelical, Catholic, and Orthodox churches teach that all same-sex acts are sinful, based on these passages and natural law theology.\n- **Progressive View**: Some denominations (e.g., UCC, Episcopal Church USA, PCUSA) affirm LGBTQ+ relationships, arguing:\n  - The Bible addresses specific historical practices (e.g., idolatrous sex, rape, pederasty), not modern consensual relationships.\n  - Jesus emphasized love (Matthew 22:37-40) and inclusion (Galatians 3:28).\n  - Scientific understanding of sexual orientation wasn’t available in biblical times.\n\n### Important Context\n- **Ancient Cultural Norms**: Biblical writers understood sexuality through lenses of purity, procreation, and social order—not orientation. Same-sex acts were often linked to power imbalances (e.g., master/slave) or idolatry.\n- **Covenant Theology**: Christians believe the New Covenant in Christ fulfills Old Testament law (Matthew 5:17). Passages like Galatians 5:14 prioritize love over ritual codes.\n\n### Scholarly Debates\n- **Greek Terms**: Words like *arsenokoitai* (1 Cor. 6:9) are poorly attested in ancient texts. Some scholars argue they refer to male prostitution or exploitative relationships.\n- **Nature vs. Behavior**: Many argue the Bible condemns *actions*, not orientation. Orientation itself isn’t discussed.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Traditional Interpretation**: Yes, same-sex acts are considered sinful based on specific texts and theological reasoning.\n- **Progressive Interpretation**: No, the Bible does not condemn faithful same-sex relationships; it addresses different contexts.\n\n**Pastoral Note**: Many LGBTQ+ Christians reconcile their faith and identity through affirming theology. Denominational stances vary widely, and personal discernment is essential. If you’re exploring this, consider discussing with a trusted spiritual advisor. Ultimately, Jesus’ call to love God and neighbor (Matthew 22:37-40) remains central for most Christians.",
