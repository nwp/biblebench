    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "The question of baptismal formula—specifically whether one must be baptized \"in Jesus' name\" or using the Trinitarian formula of \"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\"—is a significant point of divergence between Oneness Pentecostalism and historic orthodox Christianity. This issue touches not only on the rite of baptism itself but also on the deeper doctrinal understanding of the nature of God (Christology and Trinitarian theology).\n\nHere is an analysis of the Oneness position, the Scriptural evidence, and how it relates to orthodox Christian theology.\n\n### 1. The Oneness Pentecostal Position\n\nOneness Pentecostals (often associated with the United Pentecostal Church International and similar movements) reject the traditional doctrine of the Trinity. Instead, they hold to a non-Trinitarian view often termed \"Modalism\" or \"Oneness,\" believing that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not distinct persons within the Godhead, but rather three different manifestations, titles, or offices of the one God—who is Jesus Christ.\n\nConsequently, they teach that the correct baptismal formula is strictly \"in the name of Jesus\" (often referencing Acts 2:38). They argue that:\n*   The \"name\" of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is Lord Jesus Christ.\n*   The disciples in the Book of Acts always baptized using the formula \"in the name of Jesus.\"\n*   To baptize using the titles \"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\" is to baptize in \"titles\" rather than the \"name,\" rendering the baptism invalid for salvation.\n\n### 2. What Does Scripture Teach?\n\nTo analyze this fairly, we must look at the specific biblical texts cited by both sides.\n\n**The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19):**\n> *\"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\"*\n\nFrom an orthodox perspective, this is the definitive command of Jesus regarding baptism. It is explicit, liturgical, and theological. The singular use of the word \"name\" followed by the three persons is one of the strongest biblical supports for the doctrine of the Trinity. Orthodox theology interprets this as a command to invoke the Triune God.\n\n**The Accounts in Acts (Acts 2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5):**\n> *\"Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins...'\"* (Acts 2:38)\n\nIn the narrative of Acts, we consistently see references to being baptized \"in the name of the Lord Jesus,\" \"in the name of Jesus Christ,\" or simply \"in the name of Jesus.\"\n\n### 3. Reconciling the Passages\n\nThe theological disagreement arises in how these two sets of texts are harmonized.\n\n**The Orthodox Interpretation:**\nHistoric Christianity (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant) views Matthew 28:19 as the **prescriptive** command (the *what* and *how*), while the accounts in Acts are **descriptive** narratives (the *what happened*). Theologians argue that the phrase \"in the name of Jesus\" in Acts does not refer to an exact verbal liturgy, but rather denotes the **authority** of Christ. Just as a police officer acts \"in the name of the law,\" the early church baptized by the authority of the Messiah whom they had just recognized.\n\nTherefore, when the early church baptized, they were obeying Christ’s command in Matthew 28, but the summary record in Acts highlights that they were doing so under the authority and Messiahship of Jesus. The Didache (an early Christian manual dated roughly AD 50–90), which heavily references Matthew’s Gospel, instructs believers to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, confirming the early church’s practice of the Triune formula.\n\n**The Oneness Interpretation:**\nOneness believers generally view the passages in Acts as the **prescriptive** model for the New Testament church. They argue that since the Book of Acts records the history of the early church's practice, it supersedes the command in Matthew. They often interpret Matthew 28:19 as a prophecy or a description, arguing that the \"name\" (singular) revealed in verse 19 is actually Jesus. They may claim that if Peter (given the keys to the kingdom) commanded baptism in Jesus' name in Acts 2, he was interpreting the true intent of Jesus' command in Matthew 28.\n\n### 4. Areas of Agreement and Departure\n\n**Agreement:**\n*   **The Necessity of Baptism:** Both Oneness and orthodox Christians generally affirm that baptism is a vital command of Christ (though they may disagree on whether it is strictly necessary for *salvation* vs. an ordinance of obedience).\n*   **Centrality of Jesus:** Both affirm that salvation is found in no one other than Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12). Both believe baptism must be Christ-centered.\n\n**Departure:**\n\n*   **Validity of Baptism (Soteriology):**\n    *   *Orthodox View:* A baptism is considered valid if performed with water and the Trinitarian formula (or, in some traditions, with the intent to do what the Church does). Denying the Trinity generally renders a baptism invalid in historic churches because it baptizes into a \"different god\" (theologically speaking).\n    *   *Oneness View:* A Trinitarian baptism is considered invalid because the correct \"name\" (Jesus) was not spoken. This often leads Oneness groups to \"re-baptize\" converts coming from Trinitarian backgrounds.\n\n*   **The Nature of God (Christology):**\n    *   This is the root of the disagreement. Orthodox Christianity insists that the Trinitarian formula is necessary because it accurately reflects the revelation of God’s nature. To baptize only in the name of Jesus, to the exclusion of the Father and Spirit as distinct persons, is viewed as confessing Christ while denying the fullness of His divine nature and relationship within the Godhead.\n    *   Oneness theology views the Trinity as a \"pagan\" or \"philosophical\" distortion of the strict monotheism of the Bible. Therefore, they see the Trinitarian formula as a man-made tradition that violates the biblical mandate.\n\n### 5. Theological Conclusion\n\nScripture presents both the command of the risen Christ in Matthew 28:19 and the apostolic practice recorded in Acts. Historic orthodox Christianity holds that these are not contradictions but complementary truths: baptism is by the authority of Jesus (Acts), administered in the name of the Triune God (Matthew).\n\nThe Oneness teaching that Trinitarian baptism is invalid represents a significant departure from historic orthodoxy. It elevates the specific verbal utterance of \"Jesus\" over the explicit grammatical and theological command of Matthew 28:19. Furthermore, it creates a soteriological requirement where the specific pronunciation of the name determines the validity of the grace received, rather than the faith of the recipient and the promise of God attached to the ordinance.\n\nIn summary, while Scripture emphasizes that all salvation is accomplished *by* Jesus and *in* His authority, the explicit command regarding the *formula* of baptism given by Christ Himself is Trinitarian. The Oneness teaching, while sincere in its desire to uphold biblical monotheism, ultimately reinterprets Scripture through a theological lens (Modalism) that differs radically from the universal understanding of the early church and the canon of Scripture.",

            "The claim that 'Disciples in Acts always baptized using the formula \"in the name of Jesus\"' is an overgeneralization. Acts records baptism in the name of Jesus in several instances, but the early church’s baptismal language showed variation, and some argue that the authoritative impulse behind baptism is 'in the name of Jesus' rather than a fixed liturgical phrase in every context.",
            "The presentation of the Didache as an unequivocal universal rule for apostolic practice is nuanced. While Didache 7:1–3 supports a Triune baptismal formula, historians debate its status as a universal, post-Acts rule rather than a late-First-Century summary of apostolic practice.",
            "The assertion that historic Christianity has ‘always’ accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid simplifies early diversity. The broad claim is justified in later universal Christendom, but early practice varied and dialog about baptismal formulas continued through patristic debates.",
            "Some Oneness positions differ among adherents, and the summary occasionally glosses over the range of Oneness interpretations (e.g., their understanding of the name Jesus as encompassing the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in one person) and how individual Oneness groups handle baptism in mixed contexts.",
            "The conclusion risks implying that any deviation from the Triune formula invalidates baptism across all historical contexts. Historic orthodoxy emphasizes proper baptism as placed within the Trinitarian baptismal rubric, but church history has also considered issues of baptismal faith, a proper administration, and intent, rather than formula alone, in determining validity."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is strong in outlining the core biblical texts (Matthew 28:19 and Acts 2:38 et al.) and in presenting the orthodox-historic reading that the Great Commission governs the form of baptism while Acts records the visible practice under Christ’s authority. It correctly notes the Didache as early evidence for the Triune formula and recognizes the Oneness emphasis and its doctrinal motivations (non-Trinitarian Monotheism/Modalism). The analysis captures key doctrinal tensions and explains why many traditions view Trinitarian baptism as foundational. However, it slightly overstates certain claims (e.g., that Acts always used a fixed ‘in Jesus’ name’ formula; that historical Christianity uniformly treated Trinitarian baptism as universally valid from the outset) and could acknowledge more explicitly the diversity of early baptisms and the ongoing patristic debate prior to the creedal formulations. Overall, it presents a solid, biblically grounded, and nuanced evaluation compatible with orthodox Christianity."
