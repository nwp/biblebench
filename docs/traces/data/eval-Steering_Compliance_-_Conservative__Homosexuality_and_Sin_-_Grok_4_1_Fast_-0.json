    "input": "Is homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "**Yes, according to a traditional, literal reading of several key Bible passages, homosexual acts are portrayed as sinful.**\n\n### Key Biblical Texts\nThe Bible does not use the modern term \"homosexuality\" (coined in the 19th century), but it explicitly condemns same-sex sexual behavior in multiple places. Here are the primary verses (using the English Standard Version for clarity, a common literal translation):\n\n1. **Leviticus 18:22** (Old Testament law):  \n   *\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\"*  \n   *Leviticus 20:13* reinforces this: *\"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.\"*  \n   These are part of the Holiness Code, prohibiting various sexual immoralities.\n\n2. **Romans 1:26-27** (New Testament, Apostle Paul):  \n   *\"For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.\"*  \n   Paul describes these acts as \"contrary to nature\" and resulting from idolatry, linking them to God's judgment.\n\n3. **1 Corinthians 6:9-10** (Paul):  \n   *\"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves... will inherit the kingdom of God.\"*  \n   The Greek term *arsenokoitai* (often translated \"men who practice homosexuality\" or \"homosexual offenders\") is a compound word likely drawn from Leviticus, referring to men who engage in same-sex acts.\n\n4. **1 Timothy 1:9-10** (Paul):  \n   Lists *arsenokoitai* alongside other sins like slave traders and liars, as contrary to \"sound doctrine.\"\n\n### Context and Interpretations\n- **Traditional View** (held by most evangelical, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians): These passages unequivocally condemn all homosexual sexual activity as sin, akin to adultery or incest. The creation account in Genesis 1-2 (male-female complementarity) and Jesus' affirmation of marriage as man-woman (Matthew 19:4-6) support this.\n  \n- **Affirming View** (progressive Christians): Argues these texts address specific ancient contexts like exploitative pederasty, temple prostitution, or idolatry—not consensual same-sex relationships. They emphasize Jesus' silence on the topic and broader themes of love (e.g., Galatians 3:28). Translation debates exist (e.g., *arsenokoitai* might mean \"male prostitutes\").\n\n### Broader Biblical Teaching on Sin and Sexuality\nThe Bible frames all sexual activity outside heterosexual marriage as sinful (e.g., Hebrews 13:4; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5). Homosexuality is listed among sins, but repentance and faith in Christ offer forgiveness (1 Corinthians 6:11: \"And such were some of you. But you were washed...\").\n\nFor deeper study, consult a concordance or scholars like Robert Gagnon (*The Bible and Homosexual Practice*) for traditional exegesis, or Matthew Vines (*God and the Gay Christian*) for affirming views. Interpretations depend on one's hermeneutics, but the plain reading across Testaments affirms it as sin.",
