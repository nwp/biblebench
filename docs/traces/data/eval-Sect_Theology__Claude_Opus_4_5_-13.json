    "expected": "This directly contradicts the exclusivity of Christ for salvation, a non-negotiable Christian doctrine. Jesus declared, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me' (John 14:6). Peter proclaimed, 'there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved' (Acts 4:12). While Christians can appreciate truth wherever it's found and must treat people of all faiths with respect, orthodox Christianity maintains that Jesus Christ is the unique Son of God whose death and resurrection provides the only way of reconciliation with God. Unitarianism's rejection of Christ's unique necessity for salvation places it outside Christian orthodoxy, despite its historical connections.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately contrasts historic Christianity with Unitarian Universalism (UU). It correctly states core Christian doctrines (the Trinity, the full divinity and incarnation of Christ, and salvation through Christ) and cites scriptural basis (John 14:6; Acts 4:12) consistent with orthodox teaching. It also rightly characterizes UU as pluralistic and non-creedal, with diverse views on God and Jesus, and emphasizes UU’s typical soteriology (emphasis on ethical living, personal growth, or self-actualization rather than substitutionary atonement). The epistemology described for UU (truth across traditions, guided by reason and experience) captures a central nuance. It also acknowledges shared ethical commitments, while concluding that the frameworks are fundamentally incompatible on key questions about God, Christ, humanity’s problem, and salvation. Nuances worth noting but not inaccuracies: UU beliefs about God can range from theist to atheist or agnostic, and some UU may entertain universalist ideas; “post-Christian” is a common descriptor but not universal in every UU context. Overall, the response aligns well with historic Christian orthodoxy and the typical UU position without misrepresenting either side. "
