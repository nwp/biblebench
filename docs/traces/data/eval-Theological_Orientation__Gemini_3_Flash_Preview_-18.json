    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of interpretative authority is one of the most significant points of divergence in Christian theology, often described as the \"formal principle\" of the Reformation versus the \"Petrine\" or \"Conciliar\" models of traditionalism.\n\nTo answer this thoughtfully, we must examine four primary models: the Roman Catholic/Eastern Orthodox view (Ecclesiastical Authority), the Classical Protestant view (Ministerial Authority), and the Radical Enlightenment/Post-Modern view (Individual Independence).\n\n### 1. The Primacy of the Church: Ecumenical Councils and Traditions\nIn **Roman Catholicism** and **Eastern Orthodoxy**, the Church is viewed as the \"pillar and ground of the truth\" (1 Timothy 3:15). In these traditions, Scripture did not fall from the sky independently; rather, the Church—under the guidance of the Holy Spirit—discerned the canon of Scripture. Therefore, the Church remains its definitive interpreter.\n\n*   **Roman Catholic Perspective:** Final authority rests with the *Magisterium* (the teaching office of the Church), consisting of the Pope and the bishops in communion with him. They argue that to prevent the \"chaos of private judgment,\" God provided an infallible guide to ensure the apostolic deposit of faith remains intact.\n*   **Eastern Orthodox Perspective:** Authority is found in \"Holy Tradition,\" which includes the consensus of the Church Fathers and, most pivotally, the **Seven Ecumenical Councils**. Interpretative authority is not centered in one office (the Papacy) but in the *conciliar* (collective) mind of the Church across time.\n\n### 2. The Protestant Reformation: *Sola Scriptura*\nThe Reformers (Luther, Calvin, etc.) rejected the idea that the Church held authority *over* Scripture. They argued for **Sola Scriptura**, asserting that the Bible is the only infallible rule for faith and practice.\n\n*   **The Individual and the Holy Spirit:** This view emphasizes the \"perspicuity\" (clearness) of Scripture. They believe the essential message of the Gospel is clear enough for any believer to understand through the illumination of the Holy Spirit.\n*   **A Common Misconception:** Contrary to modern individualism, the original Reformers did not believe in \"nuda scriptura\" (bare Scripture) or that every individual’s opinion was equally valid. They maintained a **Ministerial Authority**. They believed denominational confessions (like the Westminster Confession or the Augsburg Confession) and trained pastors provide a safety net for interpretation, though these remain subordinate to the biblical text.\n\n### 3. The Individual Believer: The Radical Tradition\nIn many modern evangelical, baptistic, and non-denominational circles, the \"priesthood of all believers\" (1 Peter 2:9) is interpreted as \"soul competency.\" \n\nThis view suggests that the **individual believer** is the final arbiter of meaning, guided by their conscience and the Holy Spirit. This approach prioritizes personal transformation and \"what the text means to me.\" While this empowers the laity, critics from the Catholic and Orthodox traditions argue that it leads to theological fragmentation and the \"six thousand denominations\" problem.\n\n### 4. The Wesleyan Quadrilateral: A Balanced Synthesis\nMethodist theology, stemming from John Wesley, offers a nuanced framework for authority. While Scripture is primary, interpretation is shaped by four sources:\n1.  **Scripture:** The primary source.\n2.  **Tradition:** The wisdom of the historical Church (Councils/Creeds).\n3.  **Reason:** The use of logic and critical thinking.\n4.  **Experience:** The personal encounter with the grace of God.\n\nIn this model, no single element acts in isolation; the believer interprets Scripture within the \"communion of saints\" (Tradition) and with the tools of the mind (Reason).\n\n### Theological Synthesis: Where does authority lie?\nTheologically, one’s answer usually depends on how they view the relationship between the **Word** and the **Spirit**:\n\n*   If one emphasizes the **Spirit’s work in the hierarchy**, they favor **Councils and Bishops**.\n*   If one emphasizes the **Spirit’s work in the written Word**, they favor **Scripture alone**, interpreted through **Tradition**.\n*   If one emphasizes the **Spirit’s work in the heart of the person**, they favor the **Individual**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn a balanced theological framework, these authorities function like concentric circles. **Scripture** sits at the center as the \"norming norm\" (*norma normans*). The **Ecumenical Councils/Creeds** provide the boundaries to ensure we do not fall into ancient heresies. **Church Leaders** provide shepherd-like guidance. Finally, the **Individual** must personally assent to these truths, for a faith that is merely dictated and not internally realized is no faith at all. \n\nFinal authority, therefore, is rarely a \"who\" in isolation, but a \"how\"—how the Spirit speaks through the Word within the context of the believing community.",

This indicates a nuanced, non-dogmatic approach that acknowledges diversity and seeks to harmonize rather than polarize the debates."
