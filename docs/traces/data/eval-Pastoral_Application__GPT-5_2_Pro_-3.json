    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "I am so sorry. The death of a child is a wound so deep that words can feel insulting. And when people say, “It’s God’s will” or “Everything happens for a reason,” even if they mean well, it can sound like God *wanted* your child gone—or like your pain should be quickly explained away. Scripture doesn’t talk to grieving parents that way.\n\n### 1) God is loving—and your grief matters to Him\nThe Bible does not treat death as “no big deal.” Death is called an **enemy** (1 Corinthians 15:26). Jesus Himself stood at the tomb of His friend and **wept** (John 11:35). He didn’t scold Mary and Martha for being upset; He entered their sorrow.\n\nGod draws near to the brokenhearted:  \n- **“The LORD is near to the brokenhearted.”** (Psalm 34:18)  \n- **“You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle.”** (Psalm 56:8)\n\nSo before we talk about explanations, I want you to hear this: **your grief is not a lack of faith.** Lament is biblical.\n\n### 2) “God’s will” is often said too simply\nChristians sometimes use “God’s will” to mean, “God must have *wanted* this.” But the Bible distinguishes between what God **commands and delights in** and what He **allows in a fallen world** while still remaining sovereign.\n\n- God’s **moral will** (what He loves and commands): life, love, truth, protection, justice.  \n- God’s **sovereign will** (what He permits to happen in a broken world and can still govern): even tragedies He does not delight in.\n\nWe see this difference in Scripture. God can hate something and still permit it for a time without being the author of evil. The clearest example is the cross: human beings sinned in killing Jesus, and yet God used it for salvation (Acts 2:23). That does not make God cruel; it shows He can bring good even from the worst evil.\n\nSo it may be more faithful to say: **God did not “enjoy” or “approve of” your child’s death—death is an enemy—but God was not absent, and He is not powerless.**\n\n### 3) Why do these things happen if God is good?\nThe Bible’s answer is not that every tragedy is individually “assigned” as a personalized lesson. Often, the Bible points us to the larger reality: **the world is not as God originally made it.** Sin has ruptured creation (Genesis 3; Romans 8:20–22). In a world touched by the fall, there are real losses: accidents, disease, violence, randomness we cannot control.\n\nWhen a tower collapsed and killed people, Jesus did not say, “That’s because they were worse, and God planned it as a message.” He treated it as a sober reminder that life is fragile in a broken world (Luke 13:1–5). That doesn’t answer every “why,” but it keeps us from blaming God as if He takes pleasure in crushing us.\n\n### 4) “Everything happens for a reason” is not the same as “everything is good”\nRomans 8:28 says God works all things together for good **for those who love Him**, but that verse does **not** say the thing itself is good. The death of your child is not good. It is a terrible loss. The promise is that **God can weave even this** into a story where evil does not get the final word.\n\nJoseph could say to those who harmed him, **“You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good”** (Genesis 50:20). Notice: *they meant evil.* The evil was real. Yet God’s ability to redeem did not make the evil “okay.”\n\n### 5) Where is God in this?\nThe most important Christian answer is not a formula—it’s a Person.\n\nGod did not stand far away from human suffering. In Jesus, God entered it. He knows grief from the inside. He was “a man of sorrows” (Isaiah 53:3). And He promises a day when death will finally be undone:\n\n- **“He will wipe away every tear… and death shall be no more.”** (Revelation 21:4)\n\nThat future hope doesn’t erase today’s pain, but it means your child’s death is not the end of the story.\n\n### 6) What you can do right now (and what you don’t have to do)\n- **You don’t have to rush to acceptance.** The Psalms give you words for confusion and protest (Psalm 13; Psalm 42). God can handle your questions.  \n- **Tell the truth in prayer.** “Lord, this feels unbearable.” That is a faithful prayer.  \n- **Let the church carry you.** You don’t need quick explanations—you need presence, meals, rides, help with paperwork, someone to sit and weep (Romans 12:15).  \n- **Gently set boundaries with unhelpful comments.** It’s okay to say, “I know you mean well, but that phrase hurts. What I need is your prayers and your presence.”  \n- **Get support that matches the weight of this.** Grief counseling (especially with someone who respects your faith) and a grief group can be a real gift.\n\n### 7) About your child\nParents often carry a second pain: “Where is my child now?” If you want to talk about that, I will—carefully, reverently, without pretending certainty where Scripture is quiet. What I can say now is this: **God is just, God is merciful, and you can entrust your child to Him.** Abraham’s question still holds: **“Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?”** (Genesis 18:25)\n\n---\n\nIf you’re willing, tell me about your child—what they were like, what you miss most, and what people have been saying that has hurt the deepest. I won’t try to fix it with a sentence. I’ll sit with you in it, and we’ll bring the real sorrow to the real God together.",

It preserves the distinction between God’s moral will (what He commands) and His sovereign will (what He allows in a fallen world), and it avoids implying that God delights in or directly ordains every tragedy. It affirms biblical truths: God is near to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), Jesus' compassion (John 11:35), the reality that death is an enemy (1 Cor 15:26), the Fall’s impact on creation (Rom 8:20–22), and God’s redemptive sovereignty (Rom 8:28; Gen 50:20; Gal 3:13–14). It provides sound scriptural grounding (e.g., Luke 13:1–5, Genesis 50:20, Romans 8:28, Revelation 21:4, John 11:35, Psalm 56:8, Psalm 34:18) and offers practical pastoral guidance (lament, presence, community support, grief counseling). Minor quibbles might include variations in how people articulate “moral vs. sovereign will” across traditions, but the overall framework is biblically faithful and the nuance is well-preserved."
