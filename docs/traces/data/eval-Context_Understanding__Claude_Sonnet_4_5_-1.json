          "rationale": "The answer accurately identifies Paul's pre-conversion background: Jewish heritage from Tarsus, educated as a Pharisee under Gamaliel, Roman citizenship by birth, and occupation as a tentmaker (Acts 18:3). It also correctly notes his zealous persecution of Christians (Acts 7–9; Galatians 1). The details align with primary sources (Acts, Philippians) and reflect common scholarly consensus. A minor imprecision is the characterization of his trade as 'tentmaker or leatherworker'; biblical text specifies 'tentmaker' (Acts 18:3), so this should be stated as 'tentmaker' only. The response directly answers the question and presents relevant context without venturing into theological interpretation beyond historical context."
