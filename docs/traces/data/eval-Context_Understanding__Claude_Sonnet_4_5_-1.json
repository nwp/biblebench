It correctly characterizes him as a zealous persecutor of Christians and notes his involvement in Stephen’s death and his efforts to imprison believers (Acts 7:58; 8:1; Acts 9:1-2; Acts 22:3, 28). These details align with the biblical text and traditional Christian teaching. The answer is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded. It could have added additional nuances (e.g., “Hebrew of Hebrews”) for fuller nuance, but the core facts are accurate. A minor caveat: “present at Stephen’s stoning” is commonly understood to include his consent/participation, as described in Acts 8:1 and 9:1."
