It notes that “disciples” can include more than the Twelve and reflects scholarly readings that Matthew writes for a Jewish-Christian or early Matthean community, which provides appropriate context without overstating certainty. The answer directly addresses the question by stating the primary audience as the disciples, with the crowds present as a broader hearer group, and adds reasonable scholarly nuance. No factual errors are present, and the nuance is appropriate for historical/contextual discussion."
