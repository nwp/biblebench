    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "**A Loving, Scripture‑Based Response**\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Acknowledge Your Pain—and Your Hope\n\nIt is perfectly healthy for a parent to feel *devastated and scared* when a child, especially a teenager, expresses doubt. Your love for her is clear, and the fact that she feels comfortable enough to share her doubts shows that she still cares for you and for the relationship you share.\n\n*“The father of a child sighs – for a bit lost and a bit hopeful.”* (Proverbs 1:15‑18).\n\nYou are not alone. God is with you right now, and He trusts you to “set his people free from everything that brings them into failure” (Psalm 37:7).\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Step 1 – Pray, Pray, Pray\n\n**Prayer is the bridge between your heart and God’s.** Begin by laying out all the emotions you’re feeling—fear, doubt, love, anxiety—and ask God to give you wisdom, patience, and a steady spirit to guide her.\n\n> *“Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving…”* (Philippians 4:6).\n> \n> *“The Lord is my helper, I will not fear; The Lord does everything for me.”* (Hosea 12:2)\n\nTake a moment to ask for the Holy Spirit’s presence in her life, that she might \"see with free eyes (John 8:12) the loving light of God.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Step 2 – Listen with an Open Heart\n\nAdopt the posture of *teach a child who is skeptical.* Resist the urge to immediately explain away doubts; instead, ask gentle, open questions:\n\n* “Can you tell me more about what’s making you feel uncertain? (1 Peter 5:7)”\n* “What are you experiencing right now when you try to think about God?”  \n* “Do you feel that the way we talk about God isn’t connecting with how you see the world?”\n\nListen as the church says in **1 Peter 1:23**: “You have been born anew… by the living and eternal word.”  Your compassion, not hating for her doubts, strengthens your relationship and reminds her that God loves her even “in your moments of weakness.”\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Step 3 – Model Faith, Not Dogma\n\nWhat you do often speaks louder than what you say. Let your everyday actions show a person who trusts God, who “prays when in trouble (1 Samuel 2:1)\" and “walks by faith, not by sight\" (2 Corinthians 5:7).\n\nProverbs 22:6 says, *“Start children on the right path, and they will never deviate…”* – but that path is found in character, not in a forced creed. Show her how legitimacy exists in:\n\n* A heart that sits in prayer  \n* A life that serves others out of love, not obligation  \n* A constantly growing love for truth\n\nInvite her to join you in a church activity or service. Participation is often a secret doorway to belief.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Step 4 – Offer Resources\n\n- **Engage a Youth Pastor/mentor** – their training in adolescent faith helps create a safe haven for questioning.  \n- **Read Scripture Together** – start with the message not the doctrine. Good passages for teens:  \n  - **John 1:1‑14** (the Word becoming flesh)  \n  - **James 1:19‑21** (a call to “listen, then obey”)  \n  - **Romans 8:28‑39** (God’s love, unconditional)  \n- **Recommend Books** – “The Miracle of Mindfulness” by Thich Nhat Hanh may help in seeing the presence; “Saved by Grace” by John B. Bains for biblical perspective.  \n- **Encourage a Young Adult or Bible Study**—the importance of learning is evident in **Hebrews 13:20‑21** when Paul says the “priest declares the good Earthling is the future of the Church.”\n\n---\n\n### 6.  Step 5 – Keep the Conversation Open, Not Forced\n\nEncourage a routine of “nights of prayer,” but leave the tone conversational. God’s promise in **Psalm 46:1**: *“God is our refuge.”* The sense that God is ready to listen is an invitation, not a command.\n\nIn the words of Jesus you obeyed:  \n> *“I know everything I expect”* (Ephesians 4:11‑12) – such trust formulates the base of authentic faith.\n\n**Should You Engage a Counselor?** If your child’s questioning accompanies depression, disordered eating, or self-harm, reach out for pastoral counseling, a licensed Christian therapist, or a pastor who can provide salvation-based therapy.\n\n---\n\n### 7.  Step 6 – Pray for She Himself\n\nOffer her protection and guidance:\n\n> *“Grant that we know the truth that I have the right aim, that I will grow up in obedience.”* (Joshua 1:6)\n\nInvite God’s grace into her heart, for he describes Himself as *“the only good and wonderful God”* – one *who loves even those who stumble.*\n\n---\n\n### 8.  A Final Thought: God Desires a Personal Relationship\n\nThe Scripture doesn't insist instant certainty, but a continued search lets God shape hearts.  \n> *“All the secrets of a child’s heart are locked in the mind of the Father, for you do not know most of the things you want.”* (Romans 11:35)\n\n…but Jesus paved the way: “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6). This invites a conversation that continues to grow each day, rather than an immediate confession.\n\nGive her, and yourself, grace. You were never made to carry this alone; God has a plan. Let *hope* be the balm on your anxious heart, for the Lord keeps loving the one who’s faltering.\n\n> *“Do not be afraid or discouraged, because He is with you and will not abandon you.”* (Isaiah 41:10)\n\n---\n\n**Practical Quick‑Check:**\n- **Do**: Daily family prayer  \n- **Do**: Ask for Holy Spirit guidance (1 Timothy 2:1‑2)  \n- **Do**: Invite her to a youth gathering  \n- **Don’t**: Force a confession, nor let guilt dominate  \n- **Seek**: James’ and Matthew’s encouraging words about growth in faith\n\nMay the Lord’s loving presence surround both of you throughout this period of questioning—that the question may become a stepping‑stone, not a stumbling block.  \n**God bless you and your beautiful daughter;** your faithfulness in this moment is a living testimony to the power of divine love.",

          "rationale": "The response largely preserves a pastoral, relational approach (emphasizing love, listening, prayer, safety, and ongoing dialogue), which is laudable and biblically aligned in principle. However, it is marred by extensive biblical inaccuracies: numerous misquotations or invented paraphrases, incorrect attributions, and some references to non-biblical sources as if they were Christian resources. These errors undermine theological accuracy and scriptural grounding, and they could foster misunderstanding about Scripture and doctrine. The overall nuance is present (acknowledging doubt as part of faith development and the value of counseling and healthy practices), but the reliability and orthodoxy of the scriptural content must be corrected for the answer to be trustworthy in a pastoral, biblical counseling setting."

          "rationale": "The response demonstrates genuine pastoral care, empathy, and a solid, action-oriented structure (pray, listen, model faith, involve mentors, keep conversation open). These are valuable for navigating a teen’s doubt. However, the delivery is undermined by serious theological and biblical reliability issues: several verses are misquoted or misattributed, and there are at least a few passages that are inaccurate or incoherent. The inclusion of a non-Christian mindfulness book and garbled quotes weakens the scriptural grounding. The practical steps are mostly sound, but would benefit from stricter theological accuracy, more precise scriptural citations, and explicit attention to mental health risk signals. Overall, the response scores as a compassionate but doctrinally uneven piece with notable room for correction and tightening to preserve credibility and pastoral effectiveness. To improve, replace incorrect quotations with accurate scripture, avoid non-Christian resources, and lean on well-established pastoral guidance for doubt, assurance, and mental health concerns (e.g., 1 Peter 3:15, John 14:6, Romans 8, James 1:5, Hebrews 10:23). An overall more biblically anchored and mentally healthy framework would raise both accuracy and effectiveness.)"
