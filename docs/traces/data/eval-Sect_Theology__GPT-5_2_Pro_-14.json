    "input": "What makes a religious group that uses Christian language and claims to follow Jesus fall 'outside orthodox Christianity'? Where do we draw the line?",
    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "“Outside orthodox Christianity” usually does **not** mean “not using Christian words,” “not admiring Jesus,” or “not having moral seriousness.” It means the group’s **core beliefs about God, Christ, and salvation differ from what the historic, catholic (universal) church has recognized as the apostolic faith.** The line is drawn where the church has historically said, in effect: *if you change this, you are no longer talking about the same God/gospel Christ and the apostles preached.*\n\n## 1) What “orthodox Christianity” typically means\nAcross Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and the vast majority of Protestants, “orthodox” in the broad, historical sense is anchored in:\n\n- **The canonical Scriptures** as the normative witness to apostolic teaching  \n- The **“rule of faith”** summarized in the early **ecumenical creeds and councils**, especially:\n  - **Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed (325/381)** (Trinity; full deity of the Son; worship of the Spirit)\n  - **Chalcedon (451)** (Christ is one person in two natures, fully God and fully man)\n\nThese creedal boundaries arose precisely because various movements used biblical language yet redefined it.\n\n## 2) Why Christian language isn’t enough\nA group can say “Jesus,” “Son of God,” “salvation,” “resurrection,” and still mean something substantially different.\n\nExample (without targeting any one group):  \n- One community might mean **“Jesus is the eternal Son, of one being with the Father.”**  \n- Another might mean **“Jesus is God’s highest creature”** or **“a divine being but not truly God”** or **“God wearing a human mask.”**  \nAll use “Jesus” and “Son of God,” but orthodox Christianity says these are **not interchangeable** meanings.\n\nSo the issue is often **not vocabulary but definition**.\n\n## 3) The main doctrinal “fault lines” that place a group outside orthodoxy\nHistorically, groups fall outside orthodox Christianity when they reject (or so redefine as to functionally deny) one or more of these core claims:\n\n### A. The Triune God (Nicene Trinitarianism)\nOrthodox Christianity confesses **one God in three distinct persons**: Father, Son, Holy Spirit—coeternal, coequal, one divine essence.\n\nDepartures include:\n- Denying the Trinity (strict Unitarianism)\n- Saying the Son/Spirit are not fully God (Arian-type views)\n- Collapsing the persons into one person/mode (modalism)\n\n### B. The person of Christ (Incarnation + full deity and full humanity)\nOrthodoxy confesses Jesus Christ as:\n- **Truly God** (not a lesser deity, not a creature)\n- **Truly man**\n- One person (the eternal Son) incarnate\n\nDepartures include:\n- Christ is a created being (even the highest created being)\n- Christ is only divine appearing human, or only human later “adopted”\n- Christ is a mixture/third thing rather than fully God and fully man\n\n### C. The gospel of salvation (grace grounded in Christ’s saving work)\nChristians disagree on important matters (faith/works language, sacraments, assurance), but orthodoxy insists salvation is **grounded in Christ’s atoning death and resurrection** and is **God’s gift**.\n\nA group tends to move outside orthodoxy when it teaches a fundamentally different mechanism or object of saving faith—e.g., salvation is achieved through esoteric knowledge, or by rites that replace Christ’s saving work, or by a different “Christ” than the one confessed in the apostolic witness.\n\n### D. Scripture and apostolic authority (what counts as “the gospel norm”)\nOrthodox Christianity treats the apostolic testimony (received in Scripture, read in the church) as decisive. A group may fall outside orthodoxy if it:\n- Adds new “revelations” that **overrule** or **reframe** the apostolic gospel\n- Redefines the biblical canon’s authority so radically that the historic confession becomes impossible\n\nThis doesn’t mean traditions can’t have robust authority structures (Catholic/Orthodox do), but historically those structures claim to **serve and preserve** the apostolic deposit, not replace it with a different one.\n\n## 4) Where we *don’t* usually draw the line (real differences within orthodoxy)\nMany significant disagreements have existed *within* orthodox Christianity without expelling groups from “Christian” status, such as:\n- Baptism (infant vs believer’s; mode)\n- Eucharist (symbolic vs real presence; how)\n- Church government (episcopal/presbyterian/congregational)\n- Charismatic gifts, end-times frameworks\n- The Catholic/Protestant disputes over justification language (though both sides typically claim Nicene faith)\n\nThese can be church-dividing, but they are usually not treated as redefining God or Christ at the creedal level.\n\n## 5) So where do we “draw the line” in practice?\nThere are (at least) two ways people draw it, and it helps to name them clearly:\n\n### (1) A **minimal theological** boundary: the ecumenical creeds\nA common “mere Christianity” answer is:  \n**If a group cannot affirm Nicene Trinitarianism and Chalcedonian Christology in their plain sense, it is outside orthodox Christianity.**\n\nThis is why many theologians use “Nicene” as shorthand for “orthodox.”\n\n### (2) An **ecclesial/communion** boundary: recognition by historic churches\nAnother approach asks:  \n**Is this community in continuity with the historic church’s worship, sacraments, and confession—recognized as such by the churches that see themselves as guardians of that continuity (Catholic/Orthodox, and often confessional Protestants)?**\n\nThis adds more texture than creeds alone, but it can also introduce debates about who has authority to recognize whom.\n\nIn both approaches, the recurring test is whether the group’s Jesus and gospel are **substantively the same** as the church’s historic confession, not merely verbally similar.\n\n## 6) A fair way to evaluate groups that “use Christian language”\nA respectful, clarifying method is to ask a short set of diagnostic questions:\n\n1. **Who is God?** One God in three persons, or something else?  \n2. **Who is Jesus?** Eternal Son fully God and fully man, or a different kind of being?  \n3. **What saves?** Christ’s atoning death/resurrection as God’s grace received by faith, or a different basis?  \n4. **What is authoritative?** The apostolic Scriptures (as received by the church), or later revelations that redefine them?  \n5. **How is worship directed?** To the Father through the Son in the Spirit (triune worship), or not?\n\nIf the answers diverge at the creedal center, most orthodox Christians will say: the group may be “Jesus-admiring” and “biblically literate,” but it is **not orthodox Christianity** in the historical sense.\n\n## 7) A final note on tone and charity\nCalling a group “outside orthodox Christianity” is a doctrinal classification, not a verdict on individuals’ sincerity, moral character, or the state of their souls. Historically, the church drew these boundaries to protect what it believed was the truth about **who God is** and **what God has done in Christ**, while still urging truthfulness, humility, and patient dialogue.\n\nIf you want, you can name a specific group or set of teachings, and I can apply these criteria carefully—showing exactly where it aligns with orthodox creedal Christianity and where it departs.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns closely with historic orthodox criteria: orthodoxy is defined by commitment to the core creedal doctrines (Nicene/Chalcedonian) and the Christ-centered gospel grounded in Scripture, not merely by using Christian language. It correctly identifies the main doctrinal fault lines (Trinity, Christology, salvation by grace, and the authority of Scripture/apostolic teaching) as the typical routes by which groups are considered outside orthodox Christianity. It also recognizes that genuine orthodoxy involves more than vocabulary, and that differences can occur within orthodoxy on non-central issues (baptism, Eucharist, church governance, etc.). The response provides a practical diagnostic framework (creedal benchmarks and ecclesial recognition) and a charitable note about the tone of judgment. Minor caveats could include more explicit discussion of the role of Tradition in Catholic/Orthodox settings and a wider range of examples, but these do not undermine the overall accuracy or usefulness. Overall, the answer is doctrinally solid, biblically grounded, and nuanced."
