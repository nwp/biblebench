    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "My dear friend, thank you for your courage in sharing this struggle. Your pain is real, and your seeking is valid. Let's gently lay this concern before God's Word and wisdom together.\n\n**First, hear this truth: Your struggle with depression does not indicate spiritual failure.** The idea that depression is solely due to insufficient faith or that medication contradicts trust in God is a harmful misconception. Consider these biblical truths:\n\n1.  **God's Sovereignty Over Healing:** God heals in diverse ways. Sometimes healing is instantaneous (Mark 1:41), sometimes it's gradual (Luke 17:14), and sometimes it involves human agents like physicians (Luke 4:23, Colossians 4:14). Using medication is no different than seeking surgery or physical therapy – it's a tool God provides through human wisdom and science. Proverbs 3:19-20 tells us God founded the earth by wisdom; using medicine is part of His created order for human well-being.\n2.  **Jesus' Compassion for Suffering:** Jesus never dismissed those suffering with mental or emotional anguish. He saw them, had compassion, and healed (Matthew 9:10-13, Mark 5:1-20). He wept with those who wept (John 11:35). Depression is a profound form of suffering, and Jesus meets you *in* it, not with accusation, but with mercy.\n3.  **Depression is Not Always Linked to Sin:** While sin can sometimes contribute to emotional distress (Psalm 38:3-4), the Bible presents suffering as a universal human condition (Job, Ecclesiastes, many Psalms) not always tied to personal failure. The man born blind was asked *not* if he sinned, but so that God's power might be displayed (John 9:1-3). Attributing *all* depression solely to lack of faith ignores the complex biological, environmental, and neurological factors involved.\n4.  **The Body is the Temple (But Imperfect Now):** 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 reminds us our bodies belong to God. Taking care of our physical and mental health, including using medication prescribed by a doctor, is an act of stewardship, not a denial of God's power. We live in a broken world where bodies and brains malfunction. Seeking help for your brain's chemistry is no more a failure than seeking insulin for diabetes.\n\n**Regarding the comments you've heard:**\n\n*   **They reflect misunderstanding, not divine truth.** Well-meaning believers may confuse simplistic formulas (faith = prosperity/health) with God's complex ways. This teaching can inflict deep spiritual wounds. It's crucial to separate their imperfect understanding from God's actual character and commands.\n*   **God's Grace is Sufficient:** 2 Corinthians 12:7-10 is powerful here. Paul speaks of a \"thorn in the flesh\" he pleaded for God to remove. God's response? \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\" God didn't remove Paul's struggle; He provided grace *for* it. Your depression may not be instantly healed, but God's grace is actively sustaining you *right now*, even through medication and therapy. This is not weakness negating faith; it's faith relying on God's sustaining power in weakness.\n\n**Practical Steps in Faith:**\n\n1.  **Continue Your Treatment:** Do not feel guilty for taking medication prescribed by a medical professional. It is a responsible act of self-care and faith stewardship. Discontinuing medication against medical advice due to guilt can be dangerous.\n2.  **Seek Wise Counsel:** Continue therapy. A Christian therapist can help integrate faith and mental health. If possible, seek a support group for Christian believers struggling with depression. You are not alone.\n3.  **Gently Educate:** If appropriate and safe, you might gently share this perspective with those who made the comments: \"I appreciate your concern. My faith is important to me, and I believe God honors my seeking help through doctors and medication. It's a way I steward the body He gave me.\" Set boundaries if needed.\n4.  **Focus on Relationship, Not Performance:** Your worth before God is not based on feeling joyful or \"performing\" faith perfectly. It's based solely on Christ's sacrifice (Romans 5:8). Depressed days are still days you can be loved by God. Practice resting in His grace, not striving for a \"faith level\" that earns healing.\n5.  **Lean into Community:** Surround yourself with people who offer support without judgment. Share your struggles with trusted, compassionate believers who will pray with you and walk alongside you, not offer simplistic solutions.\n6.  **Anchor in Scripture:** Meditate on Psalms of lament (like Psalm 13, 42, 43) where the psalmist pours out deep despair *to God* yet ends in trust. Pray honestly like the Psalmists – God can handle your anger, sadness, and questions.\n\n**You are not failing spiritually.** You are a beloved child of God courageously battling a real illness in a broken world. You are taking responsible steps to find healing. God sees your heart, your pain, and your desire for wholeness. He walks with you in the darkness and offers His unfailing grace as your true foundation. Trust in His sufficiency, not in the performance of your faith. You are held, you are loved, and healing – in whatever form God chooses – is possible. Amen.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately affirms that depression is a real condition and not a sign of spiritual failure, and it rightly presents medication and professional care as legitimate tools within faithful living. It consistently grounds its claims in Scripture, referencing Jesus’ compassion, the emissive role of physicians (Luke 4:14; Colossians 4:14), biblical examples of suffering (Job, Psalms, John 9:1-3), and the sufficiency of God’s grace (2 Cor 12:7-10). It emphasizes holistic stewardship of body and mind (1 Cor 6:19-20) and wisely cautions against simplistic, guilt-producing interpretations of suffering (contrast with Job’s friends). The response also offers practical, biblically informed steps for living with depression within a Christian framework, including lament, community, and prudent medical care. Minor interpretive stretches (e.g., connecting Proverbs 3:19-20 directly to medicine) do not undermine overall accuracy but are worth noting as reader discretion rather than doctrinal error. Overall, the answer aligns well with historic orthodoxy, biblical teaching, and nuanced pastoral care. "
