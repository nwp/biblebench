    "expected": "The Trinity is the Christian doctrine that God exists as three distinct persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) who are coequal and coeternal, yet remain one God in essence and substance. This is a mystery that transcends human comprehension - not three gods (tritheism) nor one person in three modes (modalism), but one God in three persons who are distinct yet inseparable in their divine nature and work.",
    "output": "# The Doctrine of the Trinity: One God in Three Persons\n\nThe doctrine of the Trinity stands as the distinctive heartbeat of Christian faith—a mystery that has captivated, challenged, and defined Christian theology for two millennia. At its core, the Trinity confesses that the one God exists eternally as three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each person is fully God, yet there is only one God. This paradox, far from being a logical contradiction, reveals the infinite richness of the divine nature and provides the grammatical framework through which Christians understand God's self-revelation, salvation, and ongoing presence in the world.\n\n## Biblical Foundations\n\nThe doctrine of the Trinity does not emerge from abstract philosophical speculation but from the pages of Scripture itself. While the word \"Trinity\" never appears in the Bible, the reality it describes saturates both Testaments, culminating in the clear testimony of the New Testament.\n\n### The Shema and Monotheistic Foundation\n\nThe Hebrew Scriptures establish an uncompromising monotheism. The Shema, Deuteronomy 6:4, declares with crystalline clarity: \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.\" This foundational confession of Israelite faith establishes that there is no multiplicity of gods—there exists a single, indivisible divine being. The prophets consistently denounce the worship of other gods as sheer idolatry, affirming that Yahweh alone is God, the Creator of heaven and earth, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Any doctrine of the Trinity must be firmly rooted in this monotheistic soil, neither diluting nor diminishing the absolute oneness of God.\n\n### The Father in Scripture\n\nThe Scriptures overwhelmingly present God primarily as Father. Throughout the Old Testament, God is called the Father of Israel, the one who created, disciplined, and called the nation into covenant relationship. Isaiah addresses God as \"Father\" and speaks of Israel as His children (Isaiah 63:16, 64:8). In the New Testament, Jesus reveals the intimate, personal dimension of this fatherhood, teaching His disciples to address God as \"Abba,\" an Aramaic term carrying the warmth of familiar affection. Paul consistently opens his letters with grace and peace \"from God our Father,\" establishing the Father's role as the source and origin of divine action in salvation history.\n\n### The Son: Divine Identity in the Gospels\n\nThe Gospel narratives present Jesus Christ in terms that transcend mere human status. From the opening of John's Gospel, Jesus is identified as \"the Word\" who \"was with God\" and \"was God\" from eternity past (John 1:1). The prologue declares that all things were made through Him, suggesting His role as the agent of creation itself. When Thomas encounters the resurrected Christ, his response is the profound confession: \"My Lord and my God!\" (John 20:28). Throughout the Gospels, Jesus claims a unique relationship with the Father, speaks with authority that belongs to God alone, forgives sins (a prerogative Scripture reserves for God), and accepts worship that Scripture consistently forbids as tribute to God alone. The author of Hebrews opens his letter by affirming that the Son is the \"radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being\" (Hebrews 1:3)—language that conveys nothing less than full divine identity.\n\n### The Holy Spirit: Divine Person and Presence\n\nThe Holy Spirit appears throughout Scripture as more than an impersonal force or divine energy. In the creation narrative, the Spirit of God hovers over the waters, actively participating in the ordering of creation (Genesis 1:2). The prophets spoke as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:21). In the New Testament, the Spirit is described as teaching, guiding, interceding, and distributing gifts among believers. Jesus promises the Holy Spirit as another Counselor who will dwell within believers (John 14:16-17), describing the Spirit as one who \"will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you\" (John 14:26). The biblical portrayal consistently presents the Spirit as a distinct divine person, not merely an aspect of God's power or an impersonal force operating according to fixed laws.\n\n### The Trinity in the Teaching of Jesus\n\nPerhaps the most explicit trinitarian passages appear at the conclusion of Matthew's Gospel, where Jesus commands His disciples to baptize \"in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\" (Matthew 28:19). This single name applied to three distinct persons reveals that Father, Son, and Spirit share identically the same divine name and authority. Similarly, in the Upper Room Discourse, Jesus speaks of sending the Holy Spirit from the Father (John 15:26), and the benediction in 2 Corinthians 13:14 invokes the grace of Jesus, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit as together conveying divine blessing.\n\n## Historical Development of the Doctrine\n\nThe church did not arrive at the doctrine of the Trinity through hasty improvisation or philosophical curiosity. Rather, the doctrine emerged through centuries of pastoral necessity, as the church confronted various distortions and worked to articulate biblical teaching with theological precision.\n\n### The Challenge of Arianism and Early Controversies\n\nThe defining crisis came in the fourth century when Arius, a presbyter in Alexandria, taught that the Son was a created being—the first and greatest of all creations, but nonetheless a creature who had a beginning. This position, while preserving monotheism in a sense, undermined the very foundation of Christian faith. If the Son were created, then He could not be truly God, and the salvation He offered would be incomplete. The Arian controversy threatened to split the empire, with bishops, emperors, and whole regions lining up on opposing sides.\n\n### The Council of Nicaea (325 AD)\n\nEmperor Constantine convened the Council of Nicaea to resolve the crisis. There, the bishops crafted a creed that would become the foundational statement of orthodox faith. The Nicene Creed confesses that the Son is \"begotten of the Father before all worlds,\" \"very God of very God,\" and \"of one substance with the Father.\" The crucial term \"homoousios\" (of the same substance) was deliberately chosen to affirm that the Son shares the very being of the Father—He is not merely similar (homoiousios) but identically divine. The creed also includes teaching about the Holy Spirit, though the full trinitarian formulation would await further clarification.\n\n### The Role of the Cappadocian Fathers\n\nThe doctrine received its classic formulation through the theological work of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus—known as the Cappadocian Fathers. These theologians developed the distinction between \"essence\" (ousia) and \"persons\" (hypostases) that would prove decisive. They argued that there is one divine essence or nature (ousia) thatFather, Son, and Spirit share completely. Within that single divine nature, there are three distinct persons (hypostases), each fully possessing the divine nature while existing in eternal, harmonious relationship. This formulation preserved both the monotheistic confession of Scripture and the full divinity of each person attested in the New Testament.\n\n### The Filioque Controversy and Later Development\n\nThe Western church later added the phrase \"and the Son\" (filioque) to the description of the Spirit's procession, teaching that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. This addition, while theologically significant, became a point of contention between Eastern and Western Christianity. However, both traditions remained committed to the core trinitarian faith, continuing to worship one God in three persons.\n\n## Theological Formulation: Understanding the Mystery\n\nThe church's trinitarian doctrine employs careful theological language to capture biblical teaching. Understanding this terminology helps clarify what Christians mean when they speak of one God in three persons.\n\n### Divine Essence and Divine Persons\n\nThe doctrine distinguishes between what God is (His essence or nature) and who God is (the persons). Divine essence refers to the being, character, and attributes that constitute God's identity—His holiness, love, justice, wisdom, and power. Divine persons refer to the three distinct modes of existence within the Godhead. The critical affirmation is that each of the three persons possesses the entirety of the divine essence completely. The Father is not one-third of God; He is fully God. The Son is not one-third of God; He is fully God. The Spirit is not one-third of God; He is fully God. Yet there are not three gods but one God. The three persons share identically the same divine nature.\n\n### The Relations of Origin\n\nThe distinctions among the persons are based primarily on their eternal relations of origin. The Father is the unbegotten origin of the Godhead—He has no source or origin within the Trinity. The Son is eternally begotten of the Father, meaning that the Father's divine nature generates the person of the Son from all eternity. This begetting is not a temporal event but an eternal relation—the Son has always existed as the Father's perfect image and radiance. The Spirit proceeds from the Father (and, in Western theology, from the Father and the Son) as the mutual love and fellowship of the Godhead. These relations of origin constitute the personal distinctions among the three persons without dividing the divine essence.\n\n### Appropriation and Indwelling\n\nTheology distinguishes between what belongs to the persons individually and what belongs to the divine essence jointly. Attributes like omniscience, omnipotence, and eternity belong equally to all three persons. However, Scripture \"appropriates\" certain works or characteristics to particular persons in ways that reflect their distinct roles in salvation history. The Father is associated with creation and sovereignty, the Son with redemption and revelation, and the Spirit with sanctification and indwelling. Yet each person is at work in all these divine works. The Spirit creates (Genesis 1:2, Psalm 104:30), the Father redeems (John 3:16, Ephesians 1:3-6), and the Son sanctifies (Hebrews 13:12). The three persons act together in perfect unity, even as Scripture highlights the distinctive contribution of each.\n\n## Common Analogies and Their Limitations\n\nBecause the Trinity represents a reality utterly unique in existence, Christians have long sought analogies to make the concept more accessible. While such illustrations can be helpful, each ultimately fails to capture the full truth.\n\n### The Egg Analogy\n\nAn egg has three parts—shell, white, and yolk—yet is one egg. This analogy captures the notion of three-in-one but fails precisely because the three parts are not each fully an egg. The shell is not itself an egg; it is merely part of an egg. In the Trinity, each person is fully God, not merely a part of God.\n\n### The Water Analogy\n\nWater can exist as ice, liquid, and steam—three forms of one substance. This analogy also fails because the three states of water cannot coexist simultaneously in the same space, and each state lacks the properties of the others. The three persons of the Trinity exist simultaneously and eternally, each fully possessing divine attributes.\n\n### The Human Consciousness Analogy\n\nSome have suggested that mind, emotion, and will represent three aspects of one person. While closer in some respects, this analogy collapses the distinction between persons into mere aspects or modes of a single person, failing to preserve the biblical testimony to three distinct subjects who can address one another, relate to one another, and act independently.\n\n### The Value of Analogies\n\nThese analogies fail not because our language is inadequate but because the Trinity describes a reality without parallel in created existence. God is utterly unique, and His triune nature reflects His freedom and sovereignty rather than logical necessity. The doctrine of the Trinity teaches that the one true God has always existed as Father, Son, and Spirit in eternal communion—this is simply who God is.\n\n## Practical Significance of the Trinity\n\nThe doctrine of the Trinity is not merely an abstract theological puzzle but carries profound implications for Christian faith and practice.\n\n### The Basis of Salvation\n\nThe triune structure of the Godhead is intimately connected with the work of salvation. The Father initiates salvation, sending His Son to redeem humanity. The Son accomplishes salvation through His life, death, and resurrection. The Spirit applies salvation, regenerating hearts and sanctifying believers. This cooperative work of Father, Son, and Spirit reveals that salvation flows from the love of the entire Godhead and that redemption involves reconciliation with God in His triune being.\n\n### The Pattern for Christian Community\n\nThe eternal communion of Father, Son, and Spirit provides the paradigm for human community. The persons of the Trinity exist in perfect relationship—united in purpose, mutually loving, and glorifying one another. Christians, made in the image of this triune God, are called to reflect this communion in their relationships with one another and with the world.\n\n### The Assurance of Faith\n\nThe triune God has revealed Himself in history, entering into relationship with His creation. This means that the God whom Christians worship is not a distant deistic principle but a personal God who knows, loves, and interacts with His creatures. The doctrine of the Trinity assures believers that they approach a God who has made Himself known and who welcomes them into relationship with Himself.\n\n## Embracing the Mystery\n\nThe doctrine of the Trinity, properly understood, does not resolve into neat rational categories but remains a mystery to be adored. This is not a mystery of confusion or contradiction but a mystery of superabundant riches—a reality deeper than human language can fully capture. Christians embrace this mystery not as an intellectual frustration but as an invitation to wonder at the infinite depth and beauty of the God who has revealed Himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nThe Trinity reveals that the one God is relational from all eternity—that love and communion belong to God's very being before ever creation existed. Before the foundations of the world, the Father loved the Son, the Son glorified the Father, and the Spirit rested between them in perfect fellowship. This is the God into whose name Christians are baptized, the God whose blessing they receive, and the God in whom they place their eternal trust.# The Doctrine of the Trinity: One God in Three Persons\n\nThe doctrine of the Trinity stands as the distinctive heartbeat of Christian faith—a mystery that has captivated, challenged, and defined Christian theology for two millennia.

          "text": "# The Doctrine of the Trinity: One God in Three Persons\n\nThe doctrine of the Trinity stands as the distinctive heartbeat of Christian faith—a mystery that has captivated, challenged, and defined Christian theology for two millennia. At its core, the Trinity confesses that the one God exists eternally as three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each person is fully God, yet there is only one God. This paradox, far from being a logical contradiction, reveals the infinite richness of the divine nature and provides the grammatical framework through which Christians understand God's self-revelation, salvation, and ongoing presence in the world.\n\n## Biblical Foundations\n\nThe doctrine of the Trinity does not emerge from abstract philosophical speculation but from the pages of Scripture itself. While the word \"Trinity\" never appears in the Bible, the reality it describes saturates both Testaments, culminating in the clear testimony of the New Testament.\n\n### The Shema and Monotheistic Foundation\n\nThe Hebrew Scriptures establish an uncompromising monotheism. The Shema, Deuteronomy 6:4, declares with crystalline clarity: \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.\" This foundational confession of Israelite faith establishes that there is no multiplicity of gods—there exists a single, indivisible divine being. The prophets consistently denounce the worship of other gods as sheer idolatry, affirming that Yahweh alone is God, the Creator of heaven and earth, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Any doctrine of the Trinity must be firmly rooted in this monotheistic soil, neither diluting nor diminishing the absolute oneness of God.\n\n### The Father in Scripture\n\nThe Scriptures overwhelmingly present God primarily as Father. Throughout the Old Testament, God is called the Father of Israel, the one who created, disciplined, and called the nation into covenant relationship. Isaiah addresses God as \"Father\" and speaks of Israel as His children (Isaiah 63:16, 64:8). In the New Testament, Jesus reveals the intimate, personal dimension of this fatherhood, teaching His disciples to address God as \"Abba,\" an Aramaic term carrying the warmth of familiar affection. Paul consistently opens his letters with grace and peace \"from God our Father,\" establishing the Father's role as the source and origin of divine action in salvation history.\n\n### The Son: Divine Identity in the Gospels\n\nThe Gospel narratives present Jesus Christ in terms that transcend mere human status. From the opening of John's Gospel, Jesus is identified as \"the Word\" who \"was with God\" and \"was God\" from eternity past (John 1:1). The prologue declares that all things were made through Him, suggesting His role as the agent of creation itself. When Thomas encounters the resurrected Christ, his response is the profound confession: \"My Lord and my God!\" (John 20:28). Throughout the Gospels, Jesus claims a unique relationship with the Father, speaks with authority that belongs to God alone, forgives sins (a prerogative Scripture reserves for God), and accepts worship that Scripture consistently forbids as tribute to God alone. The author of Hebrews opens his letter by affirming that the Son is the \"radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being\" (Hebrews 1:3)—language that conveys nothing less than full divine identity.\n\n### The Holy Spirit: Divine Person and Presence\n\nThe Holy Spirit appears throughout Scripture as more than an impersonal force or divine energy. In the creation narrative, the Spirit of God hovers over the waters, actively participating in the ordering of creation (Genesis 1:2). The prophets spoke as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:21). In the New Testament, the Spirit is described as teaching, guiding, interceding, and distributing gifts among believers. Jesus promises the Holy Spirit as another Counselor who will dwell within believers (John 14:16-17), describing the Spirit as one who \"will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you\" (John 14:26). The biblical portrayal consistently presents the Spirit as a distinct divine person, not merely an aspect of God's power or an impersonal force operating according to fixed laws.\n\n### The Trinity in the Teaching of Jesus\n\nPerhaps the most explicit trinitarian passages appear at the conclusion of Matthew's Gospel, where Jesus commands His disciples to baptize \"in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\" (Matthew 28:19). This single name applied to three distinct persons reveals that Father, Son, and Spirit share identically the same divine name and authority. Similarly, in the Upper Room Discourse, Jesus speaks of sending the Holy Spirit from the Father (John 15:26), and the benediction in 2 Corinthians 13:14 invokes the grace of Jesus, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit as together conveying divine blessing.\n\n## Historical Development of the Doctrine\n\nThe church did not arrive at the doctrine of the Trinity through hasty improvisation or philosophical curiosity. Rather, the doctrine emerged through centuries of pastoral necessity, as the church confronted various distortions and worked to articulate biblical teaching with theological precision.\n\n### The Challenge of Arianism and Early Controversies\n\nThe defining crisis came in the fourth century when Arius, a presbyter in Alexandria, taught that the Son was a created being—the first and greatest of all creations, but nonetheless a creature who had a beginning. This position, while preserving monotheism in a sense, undermined the very foundation of Christian faith. If the Son were created, then He could not be truly God, and the salvation He offered would be incomplete. The Arian controversy threatened to split the empire, with bishops, emperors, and whole regions lining up on opposing sides.\n\n### The Council of Nicaea (325 AD)\n\nEmperor Constantine convened the Council of Nicaea to resolve the crisis. There, the bishops crafted a creed that would become the foundational statement of orthodox faith. The Nicene Creed confesses that the Son is \"begotten of the Father before all worlds,\" \"very God of very God,\" and \"of one substance with the Father.\" The crucial term \"homoousios\" (of the same substance) was deliberately chosen to affirm that the Son shares the very being of the Father—He is not merely similar (homoiousios) but identically divine. The creed also includes teaching about the Holy Spirit, though the full trinitarian formulation would await further clarification.\n\n### The Role of the Cappadocian Fathers\n\nThe doctrine received its classic formulation through the theological work of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus—known as the Cappadocian Fathers. These theologians developed the distinction between \"essence\" (ousia) and \"persons\" (hypostases) that would prove decisive. They argued that there is one divine essence or nature (ousia) thatFather, Son, and Spirit share completely. Within that single divine nature, there are three distinct persons (hypostases), each fully possessing the divine nature while existing in eternal, harmonious relationship. This formulation preserved both the monotheistic confession of Scripture and the full divinity of each person attested in the New Testament.\n\n### The Filioque Controversy and Later Development\n\nThe Western church later added the phrase \"and the Son\" (filioque) to the description of the Spirit's procession, teaching that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. This addition, while theologically significant, became a point of contention between Eastern and Western Christianity. However, both traditions remained committed to the core trinitarian faith, continuing to worship one God in three persons.\n\n## Theological Formulation: Understanding the Mystery\n\nThe church's trinitarian doctrine employs careful theological language to capture biblical teaching. Understanding this terminology helps clarify what Christians mean when they speak of one God in three persons.\n\n### Divine Essence and Divine Persons\n\nThe doctrine distinguishes between what God is (His essence or nature) and who God is (the persons). Divine essence refers to the being, character, and attributes that constitute God's identity—His holiness, love, justice, wisdom, and power. Divine persons refer to the three distinct modes of existence within the Godhead. The critical affirmation is that each of the three persons possesses the entirety of the divine essence completely. The Father is not one-third of God; He is fully God. The Son is not one-third of God; He is fully God. The Spirit is not one-third of God; He is fully God. Yet there are not three gods but one God. The three persons share identically the same divine nature.\n\n### The Relations of Origin\n\nThe distinctions among the persons are based primarily on their eternal relations of origin. The Father is the unbegotten origin of the Godhead—He has no source or origin within the Trinity. The Son is eternally begotten of the Father, meaning that the Father's divine nature generates the person of the Son from all eternity. This begetting is not a temporal event but an eternal relation—the Son has always existed as the Father's perfect image and radiance. The Spirit proceeds from the Father (and, in Western theology, from the Father and the Son) as the mutual love and fellowship of the Godhead. These relations of origin constitute the personal distinctions among the three persons without dividing the divine essence.\n\n### Appropriation and Indwelling\n\nTheology distinguishes between what belongs to the persons individually and what belongs to the divine essence jointly. Attributes like omniscience, omnipotence, and eternity belong equally to all three persons. However, Scripture \"appropriates\" certain works or characteristics to particular persons in ways that reflect their distinct roles in salvation history. The Father is associated with creation and sovereignty, the Son with redemption and revelation, and the Spirit with sanctification and indwelling. Yet each person is at work in all these divine works. The Spirit creates (Genesis 1:2, Psalm 104:30), the Father redeems (John 3:16, Ephesians 1:3-6), and the Son sanctifies (Hebrews 13:12). The three persons act together in perfect unity, even as Scripture highlights the distinctive contribution of each.\n\n## Common Analogies and Their Limitations\n\nBecause the Trinity represents a reality utterly unique in existence, Christians have long sought analogies to make the concept more accessible. While such illustrations can be helpful, each ultimately fails to capture the full truth.\n\n### The Egg Analogy\n\nAn egg has three parts—shell, white, and yolk—yet is one egg. This analogy captures the notion of three-in-one but fails precisely because the three parts are not each fully an egg. The shell is not itself an egg; it is merely part of an egg. In the Trinity, each person is fully God, not merely a part of God.\n\n### The Water Analogy\n\nWater can exist as ice, liquid, and steam—three forms of one substance. This analogy also fails because the three states of water cannot coexist simultaneously in the same space, and each state lacks the properties of the others. The three persons of the Trinity exist simultaneously and eternally, each fully possessing divine attributes.\n\n### The Human Consciousness Analogy\n\nSome have suggested that mind, emotion, and will represent three aspects of one person. While closer in some respects, this analogy collapses the distinction between persons into mere aspects or modes of a single person, failing to preserve the biblical testimony to three distinct subjects who can address one another, relate to one another, and act independently.\n\n### The Value of Analogies\n\nThese analogies fail not because our language is inadequate but because the Trinity describes a reality without parallel in created existence. God is utterly unique, and His triune nature reflects His freedom and sovereignty rather than logical necessity. The doctrine of the Trinity teaches that the one true God has always existed as Father, Son, and Spirit in eternal communion—this is simply who God is.\n\n## Practical Significance of the Trinity\n\nThe doctrine of the Trinity is not merely an abstract theological puzzle but carries profound implications for Christian faith and practice.\n\n### The Basis of Salvation\n\nThe triune structure of the Godhead is intimately connected with the work of salvation. The Father initiates salvation, sending His Son to redeem humanity. The Son accomplishes salvation through His life, death, and resurrection. The Spirit applies salvation, regenerating hearts and sanctifying believers. This cooperative work of Father, Son, and Spirit reveals that salvation flows from the love of the entire Godhead and that redemption involves reconciliation with God in His triune being.\n\n### The Pattern for Christian Community\n\nThe eternal communion of Father, Son, and Spirit provides the paradigm for human community. The persons of the Trinity exist in perfect relationship—united in purpose, mutually loving, and glorifying one another. Christians, made in the image of this triune God, are called to reflect this communion in their relationships with one another and with the world.\n\n### The Assurance of Faith\n\nThe triune God has revealed Himself in history, entering into relationship with His creation. This means that the God whom Christians worship is not a distant deistic principle but a personal God who knows, loves, and interacts with His creatures. The doctrine of the Trinity assures believers that they approach a God who has made Himself known and who welcomes them into relationship with Himself.\n\n## Embracing the Mystery\n\nThe doctrine of the Trinity, properly understood, does not resolve into neat rational categories but remains a mystery to be adored. This is not a mystery of confusion or contradiction but a mystery of superabundant riches—a reality deeper than human language can fully capture. Christians embrace this mystery not as an intellectual frustration but as an invitation to wonder at the infinite depth and beauty of the God who has revealed Himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nThe Trinity reveals that the one God is relational from all eternity—that love and communion belong to God's very being before ever creation existed. Before the foundations of the world, the Father loved the Son, the Son glorified the Father, and the Spirit rested between them in perfect fellowship. This is the God into whose name Christians are baptized, the God whose blessing they receive, and the God in whom they place their eternal trust.# The Doctrine of the Trinity: One God in Three Persons\n\nThe doctrine of the Trinity stands as the distinctive heartbeat of Christian faith—a mystery that has captivated, challenged, and defined Christian theology for two millennia.
