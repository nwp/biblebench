    "expected": "Calvinism and Arminianism differ primarily on sovereignty and free will. Calvinists emphasize God's unconditional election, where God chooses who will be saved based solely on His will (TULIP: Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance of saints). Arminians emphasize that God's election is based on foreknowledge of who will freely choose faith, that Christ's atonement is unlimited, that grace can be resisted, and that believers can potentially lose salvation. Both affirm salvation by grace through faith and God's sovereignty, but differ on how divine sovereignty relates to human choice. Both views have been held by orthodox Christians throughout church history.",
    "output": "Here is a clear, fair-minded overview of the main differences between Calvinist and Arminian theology, with notes on how each side understands key questions. I’ll also flag where traditions differ within each camp and how these views play out in life and ministry.\n\nBig-picture summary\n- Both traditions affirm: salvation is by God’s grace through faith in Christ; humans are sinful and need regeneration; the Holy Spirit is at work in calling people to Christ; Scripture is the authority for faith and life.\n- The disagreement lives in how precisely God’s sovereignty and human freedom interact in the process of salvation: Who has the initiative? On what basis does God elect or choose? How is Christ’s atonement applied? Can a believer truly fall away? How does grace enable or require human response?\n\nKey doctrinal contrasts, theme by theme\n\n1) Election and predestination\n- Calvinism (Reformed traditional view)\n  - Election is unconditional and based on God’s sovereign purpose, not on anything foreseen in humans ( faith, works, or any foreseen response).\n  - God predestines some to salvation and others to condemnation, in a way that is consistent with divine justice and mercy.\n  - Language you’ll see: unconditional election; multiple branches of election (often connected to the idea that God’s grace is efficacious for the elect).\n- Arminianism (Wesleyan-Arminian and Remonstrant tradition)\n  - Election is conditioned on God’s foreknowledge of who will respond to grace in faith. God offers salvation to all; those who believe are elect in the sense of receiving salvation.\n  - Emphasizes human freedom to accept or reject God’s grace.\n  - Key phrase: conditional election based on foreseen faith/obedience.\n- Practical note\n  - Both traditions affirm that salvation is ultimately by grace, but they disagree about whether God’s choice is unconditional or conditioned on the human response God already foreknows.\n\n2) Atonement (the scope and effect of Christ’s death)\n- Calvinism\n  - Limited (particular) atonement: Christ’s death effectively secures salvation for the elect; it is sufficient for all, but efficacious only for those God has chosen.\n  - This is often paired with the belief that God’s grace is applied to the elect through the Spirit.\n- Arminianism\n  - General (universal) or unlimited atonement: Christ died for all people, in principle providing the possibility of salvation for everyone; salvation is applied to those who believe.\n- Practical note\n  - The difference matters for how one understands election, assurance, evangelism, and the scope of God’s desire to save.\n\n3) Grace, calling, and human response\n- Calvinism\n  - Monergistic view of grace: God alone initiates and completes the saving work; the Holy Spirit irresistibly regenerates and draws the elect to faith.\n  - Grace is effectual for the elect; those whom God regenerates will inevitably believe and persevere.\n- Arminianism\n  - Synergistic view: grace enables the human will to respond; prevenient (or enabling) grace is available to all, such that people can freely accept or resist the gospel.\n  - Grace is resistible; the believer’s ongoing faith and cooperation with grace matter in the process of salvation.\n- Practical note\n  - This contrast has broad implications for how one understands evangelism, persuasion, and the ongoing life of faith.\n\n4) Call, election, and the Spirit’s work\n- Calvinism\n  - The Spirit effectually calls the elect through the gospel; this call cannot be resisted for those whom God has chosen.\n- Arminianism\n  - The Spirit’s calling is widely offered and can be resisted; the gospel call is universal in scope, with a response required by the hearer.\n- Practical note\n  - Both traditions insist that salvation is by grace, but they differ on whether that grace is irresistibly effectual when God intends to save someone.\n\n5) Perseverance and the believer’s security\n- Calvinism\n  - Perseverance of the saints: those truly elect will persevere in faith and obedience to the end; true believers are preserved by God’s power.\n  - Assurance is grounded in God’s faithfulness and the Spirit’s work in the believer.\n- Arminianism\n  - Conditional perseverance: faith can falter, and believers can fall away from grace if they do not continue to remain in faith and obedience.\n  - Assurance is possible but often understood as dependent on ongoing faithfulness and relationship with Christ.\n- Practical note\n  - Both traditions affirm the seriousness of sin and the need for grace; the difference is whether perseverance is guaranteed by God’s plan or conditioned on continued faith.\n\n6) What this means for evangelism and mission\n- Calvinism\n  - Evangelism is essential because God’s purposes include calling the elect through the gospel; the elect will come to faith as God’s Spirit works, but human responsibility to preach and persuade remains real.\n- Arminianism\n  - Evangelism is urgent and universal: God offers salvation to all; people have real freedom to respond positively or negatively to the gospel, so the church proclaims and invites all to believe.\n- Practical note\n  - Both traditions are mission-driven; the difference is often in how one understands the relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility in the spread of the gospel.\n\nRepresentative confessional anchors and traditions\n- Calvinist/Reformed anchors\n  - Canons of Dort (1618–1619): five points often summarized as TULIP (Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance of the saints).\n  - Westminster Standards (Confession of Faith and Larger/Shorter Catechisms): classic formulations of Reformed soteriology.\n  - Heidelberg Catechism and other Reformed confessions also reflect this emphasis.\n- Arminian/Wesleyan anchors\n  - Remonstrants’ Five Articles (1610): conditional election, universal atonement, resistible grace, the possibility of apostasy, and a sincere, universal call to all.\n  - Wesleyan-Arminian tradition (Methodists and Holiness movements): emphasis on prevenient grace, the possibility of entire sanctification, and a generally universal scope of the gospel call.\n- Note on variety\n  - There are important variations within each camp. Some groups are more “strictly” Calvinist, others more “strictly” Arminian; within both camps you’ll find positions that blend or modify these categories (e.g., Molinism or certain “open theist” or “moderate Calvinist” approaches). Many Bible-believing churches hold a spectrum between these poles.\n\nCommon ground and orthodox core\n- Both streams affirm:\n  - The sovereignty of God in salvation and the necessity of grace.\n  - Human sinfulness and the need for regeneration by the Spirit.\n  - Salvation by faith in Jesus Christ and faith as the appropriate human response to God’s grace.\n  - The authority of Scripture as the rule of faith and life.\n- Differences should be understood as attempts to articulate how God’s sovereignty and human responsibility work together to save sinners, not as undermining core Christian truth.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor this to a particular tradition or denomination (for example, Presbyterian/Reformed, Methodist/Wesleyan, or Baptist) and lay out the specific confessions, catechisms, and creedal summaries those groups typically use. I can also include concise reading lists or brief summaries of the Remonstrants’ Five Articles and the Canons of Dort, or show how a given passage of Scripture is read differently from a Calvinist and an Arminian perspective.",

It cites confessional anchors from both sides (Canons of Dort, Westminster Standards, Remonstrants, Wesleyan-Arminian tradition) and invites tailoring to a specific tradition, which enhances ecumenicity. While it centers Protestant debates, it does not display denominational favoritism or assert one view as definitive over the other. If anything, it could broaden to include more explicit Catholic/Orthodox perspectives for broader(ecumenical) balance, but within its scope it is balanced."
