    "input": "Should churches prioritize social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Short answer: Yes — most faith traditions can and often should make issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality a visible priority. But how, why, and to what extent they do so should flow from their theological convictions, local context, and a careful, non‑partisan practice of Christian witness.\n\nWhy prioritizing makes sense\n- Theological grounds: Many religious texts and teachings emphasize justice, care for the poor, hospitality to strangers, and reconciliation (e.g., Micah 6:8, Isaiah, Jesus’ ministry to the marginalized, Matthew 25, James 2). For many churches these mandates are not optional extras but expressions of faithful discipleship.\n- Witness and credibility: A community that cares for the vulnerable and works for justice is more credible when it speaks about spiritual matters.\n- Social cohesion: Addressing racial and economic injustice reduces harm in the community and can help restore broken relationships so the church can better live out its mission.\n\nCommon objections and appropriate responses\n- “The church’s job is only spiritual.” Response: Spiritual formation and social action are frequently intertwined. Loving God and loving neighbor are often seen as two sides of the same coin; action without spiritual formation can be hollow, and spiritual teaching without compassion can be abstract.\n- “Risk of politicization or partisanship.” Response: Churches should distinguish prophetic advocacy from partisan campaigning. They can speak on moral issues and structural injustices without endorsing specific parties or candidates, and they should operate under legal rules that regulate political activity for religious organizations.\n- “It divides the congregation.” Response: Properly handled, justice work can deepen discipleship. But it requires patient teaching, creating space for disagreement, and emphasizing unity in essentials while allowing liberty in non‑essentials.\n\nPractical principles for prioritizing justice faithfully\n- Ground action in theology and scripture: Make clear why the church acts on these issues from its own convictions, not merely cultural pressure.\n- Start with listening and assessment: Hear those affected and analyze local needs rather than imposing outside agendas.\n- Balance immediate relief and structural change: Combine direct service (food, housing, counseling) with advocacy that addresses root causes (wage policy, housing policy, school equity).\n- Avoid partisan alignment: Advocate for policies and human dignity rather than party platforms and candidates.\n- Educate the congregation: Teach history, economics basics, and how faith informs public life so members can think well and act compassionately.\n- Build partnerships: Work with other congregations, nonprofits, and civic bodies to amplify impact and share expertise.\n- Maintain humility and accountability: Measure outcomes, be willing to change course, and welcome critique from affected communities.\n- Foster reconciliation practices: Create spaces for storytelling, confession, repentance, and rebuilding relationships across racial and economic lines.\n\nModels churches can follow\n- Service + advocacy: Offer social services while advocating for systemic reforms.\n- Reconciliation ministries: Facilitate cross‑racial small groups, joint service projects, or community dialogues.\n- Stewardship and economics: Teach generous giving, support living‑wage efforts, and encourage ethical investing.\n- Public theology: Provide consistent teaching on how faith relates to public life without endorsing partisan actors.\n\nConclusion\nChurches need not make social justice their only priority, but for most faith communities it should be an integral priority—rooted in doctrine, shaped by local reality, pursued in ways that heal rather than polarize, and expressed through both charity and structural engagement. If you’d like, tell me your tradition and local context and I can suggest specific steps or resources a congregation could follow.",
