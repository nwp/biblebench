It rejects a simplistic “Scripture vs. extra-biblical authority” dichotomy and argues that most traditions implicitly employ all four resources, while asking reflective questions about who interprets Scripture rightly and how to test new claims. This ecumenical, nuanced posture avoids strict inerrancy or fundamentalist rigidity (conservative) as well as aggressive progressive redefinition of doctrine, instead emphasizing balanced hermeneutics, safeguards, and pastoral prudence. The tone is inquisitive and inclusive rather than polemical, further supporting a moderate stance.)",
