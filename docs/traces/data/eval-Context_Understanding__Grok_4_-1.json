These elements are supported by Scripture (Acts 9 for the conversion experience; Acts 22:3 for his upbringing at Gamaliel’s feet; Acts 21:39 and 22:28 for his Tarsus birthplace and Roman citizenship; Acts 8:3; Galatians 1:13-14 for his persecutor background). The answer is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded. It captures the key facts without misrepresentation. A fuller nuance could add Cilicia to specify “Tarsus in Cilicia” and note the Damascus road conversion event explicitly, but these are enhancements rather than corrections of the core background. "
