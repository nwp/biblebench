    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "Thank you for trusting me enough to walk through that door and share what is burdening your heart. It takes immense courage to voice these questions, and I want you to know that this office is a safe place. You are met here not with judgment, but with the same grace that I, and every other believer, desperately need every day.\n\nYou have asked two very deep, painful questions. Let’s sit together with them, opening God's Word to find our footing.\n\n### \"Does God hate me?\"\n\nLet me answer this immediately and unequivocally: **No.**\n\nGod does not hate you. In fact, the very opposite is true. We see in Scripture that God is the Creator of every human soul, and He loves what He has made. But the ultimate proof of His love isn't found in how we feel about ourselves; it is found in the Cross.\n\nRomans 5:8 tells us, *\"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\"*\n\nNotice that verse doesn't say \"Once we had everything figured out\" or \"Once we stopped wrestling with broken desires.\" It says *while* we were sinners. If you are in Christ, God’s affection for you is set on you because of Jesus. He looks at you and sees His beloved child.\n\nIt is true that God hates *sin*—He hates it because it distorts His image in us and separates us from Him. But we must distinguish between the person and the fallenness that affects us all. Satan, the \"accuser of the brethren,\" wants you to equate your temptations with your identity. He wants you to believe you are disqualified from love. But the Gospel says you are fearfully and wonderfully made, and deeply loved, even while you are in the midst of the struggle.\n\n### \"Can I be a Christian and experience these feelings?\"\n\nThe short answer is: **Yes.**\n\nTo understand this, we have to make a vital biblical distinction between *temptation* (or attraction) and *sin*.\n\nHebrews 4:15 tells us that we have a High Priest (Jesus) who is *\"sympathetic to our weaknesses\"* and was *\"tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.\"*\n\nIf Jesus was tempted and yet was without sin, then the experience of temptation itself—the involuntary arrival of a feeling or desire—is not the same as sinning. Sin happens when we welcome that desire, dwell on it, cultivate it, or act upon it (James 1:14-15).\n\nBeing a Christian does not mean you suddenly stop experiencing broken desires.\n*   The Christian who struggles with anger still feels the flash of rage.\n*   The Christian who struggles with greed still feels the pull of materialism.\n*   And the Christian who encounters same-sex attraction still feels that pull.\n\nWe live in a fallen world, and our bodies and minds are subject to the \"groaning\" of creation (Romans 8:23). Your attractions are a result of the Fall, just as sickness or pride are. They are not what God designed, but experiencing them does not mean you are not His.\n\nActually, the fact that you are *conflicted* by these feelings—that you are asking these questions and desiring to honor God—is often an evidence of the Holy Spirit at work in you. A heart that is dead in sin rarely worries about pleasing God. The warfare you feel is the battle between the Spirit and the flesh that Galatians 5 talks about.\n\n### Your Identity and Your Walk\n\nHere is the difficult, yet liberating truth: While you can be a Christian and have these feelings, the call of Christ is to submit *all* feelings to His Lordship.\n\nOur culture tells you that your sexual desires are who you *are*. It says you must act on them to be authentic. Jesus offers a different path. He says that you are who *He* says you are. You are not your sexuality. You are a child of God, bought with a price.\n\nThis means that while the *feelings* may persist, we are called to a life of holiness. Scripture is clear that God’s design for sexual intimacy is reserved for the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6). This is a hard teaching in our current age, and perhaps a heavy cross to carry. But Jesus promises that His yoke is easy and His burden is light—not because the commands are easy, but because He carries the weight with us.\n\nSo, how do we walk this out?\n\n1.  **Don't Identify by your Attemptations:** You are not a \"Gay Christian\" in the sense that your sexuality defines your core nature; you are a Christian—a follower of Jesus—who experiences same-sex attraction. Your identity is hidden in Christ (Colossians 3:3).\n2.  **Bring it into the Light:** Shame grows in the dark. By talking to me, you’ve broken the power of secrecy. Continue to seek community. You need brothers and sisters who will remind you of the Gospel, not condemn you.\n3.  **Focus on Holiness, not Heterosexuality:** Sometimes people think the goal is to become \"straight.\" The goal of the Christian life is to become *holy* and like Jesus. Whether your feelings change or not (and for some they do, for others they don't), your calling is faithfulness to Christ today.\n\n### A Closing Thought\n\nMy friend, you are entering a battle, but you do not fight alone. Please do not let the enemy convince you that your struggle puts you outside the camp of God’s grace.\n\nThe Apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians, listing many struggles including sexual ones, and he said, *\"And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God\"* (1 Corinthians 6:11).\n\nYou are washed. You are loved.\nLet us pray together that God will give you the strength to walk in obedience, and the comfort of knowing you are His.\n\n*Shall we pray?*",

          "rationale": "The LLM response is largely faithful to biblical and historic Christian teaching. It correctly affirms God’s love (Romans 5:8) and distinguishes temptation/desire from sin (Hebrews 4:15; James 1:14-15), while acknowledging the fallen state of creation (Romans 8:23). It emphasizes that identity is found in Christ, not in one’s desires, and encourages holiness and reliance on the Spirit (Galatians 5), which aligns with orthodox soteriology and sanctification. It correctly notes that sexual intimacy is designed for heterosexual marriage (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6) and that Christians may experience ongoing struggles with unwanted desires, including same-sex attraction, while remaining faithful to Christ. The response grounds its main claims in Scripture and maintains a pastoral, pastoral-tone approach, including encouragement to seek community and wise counsel, and a gospel-centered view of love and discipline through the cross (Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 6:11). \n\nNuance-wise, the answer treats temptation as not inherently sinful and emphasizes the need to submit desires to Christ, which is a sound distinction. However, it could better acknowledge the broader spectrum of Christian views on sexuality and relationships, including some traditions that accept committed same-sex relationships or differ on celibacy as a path for believers with SSA. The response implicitly assumes the traditional heterosexual-marriage ethic and does not explicitly discuss a pastoral path (e.g., celibacy as a distinct vocation) beyond general holiness, which slightly limits its scope of nuance. Overall, no theological errors are present, and the core claims are biblically grounded and doctrinally orthodox."
