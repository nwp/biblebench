    "output": "### Analysis of the Theological Statement\n\nAs a theologian specializing in church history and doctrine, I will analyze the given statement—\"Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism\"—in light of historic Christian orthodoxy. This evaluation is based on the teachings of Scripture as interpreted by the early Church Fathers, the ecumenical councils, and the creeds that define mainstream Christian belief (e.g., the Nicene Creed of 325 AD and the Chalcedonian Definition of 451 AD). These standards represent the consensus of \"orthodoxy\" (from the Greek *orthos* meaning \"right\" and *doxa* meaning \"belief\") as opposed to heresy (deviations condemned by the Church).\n\n#### Is This Teaching Orthodox or Heretical?\nThis teaching is **heretical**. It aligns closely with a view known as **Adoptionism** (also called Dynamic Monarchianism), which was explicitly rejected by the early Christian Church as incompatible with the biblical witness and the doctrine of the Trinity. While it affirms Jesus as a prophet and teacher (which is not inherently problematic), it denies his eternal divinity and pre-existence, reducing his sonship to a moment of divine \"adoption\" at his baptism. This contradicts core orthodox Christian beliefs about the person and nature of Christ.\n\n#### Explanation: Why Is This Heretical?\nTo understand why this is heretical, let's break it down by contrasting it with orthodox doctrine, drawing on historical, biblical, and theological grounds:\n\n1. **Orthodox Teaching on Christ's Divinity and Sonship**:\n   - Orthodox Christianity, as articulated in the Nicene Creed, affirms that Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God: \"begotten of the Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father.\" This means Jesus is fully divine from eternity, not created or adopted at any point in time. His incarnation (becoming human) occurred at his conception by the Holy Spirit in the Virgin Mary, but his divine nature is timeless.\n   - The doctrine of the **Trinity** (one God in three co-equal, co-eternal Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) requires that the Son is eternally divine. Any view that makes Jesus' divinity conditional or acquired undermines this, effectively subordinating the Son to the Father in a way that borders on polytheism or unitarianism.\n   - At the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD), the Church further clarified that Christ is one person with two natures—fully divine and fully human—united without confusion or division. This Chalcedonian Definition was a response to various Christological heresies and has been upheld by Catholic, Orthodox, and most Protestant traditions as the benchmark of orthodoxy.\n\n2. **The Heresy of Adoptionism**:\n   - Adoptionism posits that Jesus was born a mere human (a great prophet and teacher, as the statement says) and was only \"adopted\" as God's Son at a later point, often linked to his baptism (based on a misinterpretation of Mark 1:11, where God says, \"You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased\"). This implies Jesus became divine through moral excellence or divine favor, rather than being divine by nature.\n   - Historically, this view emerged in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. It was notably taught by figures like Theodotus of Byzantium (condemned around 190 AD) and Paul of Samosata, the bishop of Antioch, who was deposed at the Synod of Antioch in 268 AD for promoting similar ideas. Paul argued that Jesus was an ordinary man \"inspired\" by the divine Logos (Word) at baptism, but not inherently divine. The Church rejected this because it denied the Incarnation—the belief that \"the Word became flesh and dwelt among us\" (John 1:14) from the moment of conception, not later.\n   - Adoptionism was seen as a form of Monarchianism, which overemphasized God's unity (monarchy) at the expense of the distinct persons of the Trinity. It risked reducing Jesus to a \"divinized\" human, akin to pagan hero-gods, rather than the eternal God-man who saves humanity through his divine-human union.\n\n3. **Biblical and Theological Problems**:\n   - **Denial of Pre-Existence**: Scripture repeatedly affirms Jesus' eternal existence and divinity. For example:\n     - John 1:1-3: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him.\"\n     - Colossians 1:15-17: Jesus is \"the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation... in him all things were created... He is before all things.\"\n     - Philippians 2:6-7: Christ, \"though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant.\"\n     These passages show Jesus as pre-existent and divine, not a human who \"earned\" sonship.\n   - **Misinterpretation of Baptism**: The baptismal voice from heaven (Matthew 3:17; Mark 1:11) is a revelation of Jesus' existing identity, not the conferral of a new status. Orthodox interpreters like Athanasius (in his work *Against the Arians*) emphasized that this event publicly manifests what was already true eternally.\n   - **Soteriological Implications**: If Jesus is not truly divine from eternity, his atoning work on the cross loses its infinite value. Orthodox theology holds that only a divine Savior can bridge the gap between God and humanity (as in Hebrews 1:3: \"He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature\"). Adoptionism implies salvation comes through human merit, which echoes Pelagianism (another heresy) and diminishes grace.\n\n4. **Historical Context and Condemnation**:\n   - Adoptionism resurfaced in various forms, such as among some 8th-century Spanish theologians (e.g., Elipandus of Toledo), but was again condemned at the Council of Frankfurt in 794 AD under Charlemagne's influence. It has occasionally appeared in modern liberal theology or unitarian groups, but it remains outside orthodox bounds.\n   - In contrast, orthodox teachers like Irenaeus (in *Against Heresies*, c. 180 AD) and Athanasius defended Christ's eternal divinity against such views, arguing that they undermine the Gospel's core message.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThis statement represents a heretical deviation from orthodox Christian teaching because it denies the eternal divinity and pre-existence of Jesus Christ, reframing his sonship as an adoptive event rather than an intrinsic reality. While it may appeal to those seeking a \"humanized\" Jesus, it contradicts the witness of Scripture, the creeds, and the ecumenical councils that have shaped Christian doctrine for nearly two millennia. If you're exploring this topic further, I recommend studying the Nicene Creed or Athanasius' *On the Incarnation* for a deeper dive into orthodox Christology.

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies Adoptionism as a heretical view and situates it within the broader history of monarchianism and early Christology. It accurately contrasts Adoptionism with orthodox teaching: Jesus is the eternal, pre-existent Son of God, fully divine from eternity, and fully human in the incarnation (two natures, one person) as formalized in the Nicene Creed and Chalcedonian Definition. It correctly explains that the baptismal voice is understood as a revelation of Jesus’ identity rather than the moment of conferment of divinity, and it cites scriptural basis (John 1:1-3; Colossians 1:15-17; Philippians 2:6-7) to support the claim of pre-existence and divinity. The historical references (Theodotus, Paul of Samosata; Council of Chalcedon; Athanasius vs. Arians; Frankfurt) are accurate and help ground the argument. The response also notes soteriological implications (divinity is necessary for an efficacious atonement) and encourages further study of the Nicene Creed and Athanasius’ On the Incarnation, which are consistent with orthodox doctrine. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced. No clear theological errors are present.)"
