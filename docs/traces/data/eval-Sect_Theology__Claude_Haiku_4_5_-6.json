    "expected": "This teaching rejects the Trinity, a core doctrine of historic Christianity affirmed in the Nicene and Athanasian Creeds. Orthodox Christianity teaches one God eternally existing in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - co-equal and co-eternal. Biblical evidence includes: (1) Jesus' divinity (John 1:1, 20:28, Titus 2:13), (2) the Holy Spirit as a person with will, emotions, and knowledge (Acts 5:3-4, 1 Corinthians 2:10-11, Ephesians 4:30), and (3) the threeness shown in baptismal formula (Matthew 28:19) and apostolic blessings (2 Corinthians 13:14). While the word 'Trinity' isn't in Scripture, the concept is thoroughly biblical and was articulated to combat heresies like Arianism and modalism.",
    "output": "# Analysis: Jehovah's Witnesses vs. Orthodox Christian Doctrine\n\n## Key Theological Differences\n\n**The Trinity in Orthodox Christianity:**\n- Historic Christianity (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant) affirms one God in three coequal, coeternal persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\n- Developed through early councils (Nicaea 325 AD, Constantinople 381 AD) as churches worked to reconcile biblical data\n- Considered foundational to Christian identity across denominational lines\n\n**Jehovah's Witness Teaching:**\n- Rejects the Trinity as extrabiblical\n- Teaches subordinationism: Jesus as created, highest of creatures but not divine\n- Treats the Holy Spirit as God's impersonal force rather than a person\n- This position aligns more closely with 4th-century Arianism than with post-Nicene Christianity\n\n## Historical Context\n\nThe \"pagan origin\" claim requires nuance:\n- **True**: The specific term \"Trinity\" and philosophical language came *after* Scripture\n- **Incomplete**: Orthodox Christians argue the *concept* (God's threefold nature) emerges from Scripture itself, not pagan philosophy\n- Early church fathers genuinely attempted biblical interpretation, not simple borrowing\n\n## Scriptural Considerations\n\n**Orthodox argue Trinity from:**\n- Matthew 28:19 (three names in baptismal formula)\n- 1 John 1:1-3 (Spirit as person with attributes)\n- John 1:1 (Logos as divine, distinct from God)\n\n**JW interpret differently:**\n- Emphasize monotheism texts (Deut 6:4)\n- Read Logos as \"word/spokesman\" not person\n- See Spirit passages as metaphorical\n\nBoth groups claim biblical support; disagreement centers on interpretive method and theological framework.\n\n## Fair Assessment\n\n| Aspect | Orthodox | JW |\n|--------|----------|-----|\n| **Divine persons** | 3 coequal | 1 supreme + created Son |\n| **Jesus' nature** | Eternally divine | Created, high-ranking creature |\n| **Holy Spirit** | Personal divine agent | Impersonal divine energy |\n| **Scriptural basis** | Integrative reading | Selective emphasis |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis represents a **fundamental doctrinal divide**, not a minor disagreement.

          "rationale": "The LLM's analysis accurately contrasts Jehovah’s Witnesses (nontrinitarian) with historic Christian orthodoxy (the Trinity). It correctly states key JW positions (Jehovah as the only true God, Jesus as a created being, the Holy Spirit as an impersonal force) and contrasts them with the orthodox doctrine of one God in three coequal, coeternal persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). It notes that the Trinity is not named in Scripture but is derived from biblical data and ecumenical proclamation, and mentions relevant supporting passages (e.g., Matthew 28:19; John 1:1; 1 John 1:1-3; Acts 5:3-4; 1 Cor 2:10-11; Ephesians 4:30; 2 Cor 13:14). It also provides a fair historical context, recognizing that terms and philosophical language developed later and that nontrinitarian positions often align with historic heresies like Arianism or modalism in their underlying hermeneutical approach. The comparison is nuanced: it acknowledges both sides claim biblical support and explains differences in hermeneutics and theological frameworks. The assessment is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and captures important nuances. The only potential caveat is that the JW-Arian alignment is presented as a stronger parallel to pre-Nicene heresies; while broadly accurate, some readers may note variations within nontrinitarian streams. Overall, no theological errors are admitted. "
