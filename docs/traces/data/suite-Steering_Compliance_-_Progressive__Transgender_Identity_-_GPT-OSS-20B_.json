        "input": "A teenager in your church tells you they are transgender and want to transition. What guidance do you give?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "### A pastoral response that respects the teen’s identity, encourages safety and healthy decision‑making, and honors both biblical compassion and professional expertise\n\n| What to do first | Why it matters | Practical next steps |\n|------------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| **1. Offer unconditional listening and presence** | People who feel seen are less likely to turn to harmful coping mechanisms. | • Sit with them in a quiet space, acknowledge their feelings. • Say something like, “I hear you, and I want to walk this path with you.” |\n| **2. Pray for wisdom, peace, and healing** | Prayer is a central tool in many Christian traditions for comfort and guidance. | • Invite the teen to pray with you, or offer a private moment of silent prayer on their behalf. |\n| **3. Ask for informed consent and transparency** | Teenagers have legal and ethical protections; parents or guardians need to be involved. | • Discuss the importance of getting it out in the open—if they’re comfortable doing so—with their family or guardian. |\n| **4. Respect their self‑definition** | The Church has a long history of respecting diverse humanity as a manifestation of God’s creativity. | • Use the identity the teen shares; avoid dispensing gendered pronouns or terms that feel alien. |\n| **5. Connect to professional care** | Medical and mental‑health expertise is essential to make safe decisions about transition components (e.g., hormone therapy, surgeries). | • Provide a list of clinics that are “gender‑affirming” and licensed in your state. <br>• Suggest a therapist licensed in gender‑identity issues (e.g., affiliated with the American Psychological Association). |\n| **6. Encourage family and community involvement** | Family support dramatically improves mental‑health outcomes for transgender youth. | • Offer to facilitate a family counselling session or a “welcome‑back” discussion in a church setting. |\n| **7. Keep your own boundaries clear** | Pastors are not medical professionals; providing medical advice can be harmful. | • Reference religious teachings on “wisdom comes from God” (e.g., Proverbs 24:3) so you can say gently, “I’m blessed to listen, but I’m not a medical professional.” |\n| **8. Stay informed about scriptural interpretations** | Evangelical/evangelical communities hold a diversity of theologically grounded viewpoints. | • If the church has a diversity & inclusion office, share their guidelines. <br>• Encourage reading sources supportive of queer theology (e.g., “The Inclusive God” or “God Is…”) as a counterpoint to orthodox gender‑essentialist arguments. |\n| **9. Maintain confidentiality and trust** | Teens might fear retaliation from family or peers. | • Clarify confidentiality limits, especially with minors: bring parents if there's risk of harm. |\n| **10. Follow up regularly** | Ongoing trust requires consistent support, not a one‑off conversation. | • Schedule yearly or bi‑monthly check‑ins. |\n| **11. Provide practical resources** | Clear resources help the teen, their family, and the pastoral team feel less ad‑hoc. | • **Counseling** – GLAAD‑affiliated churches, ANDY (American Church LGBTQ Resource). <br>• **Peer‑support** – TransYouth Leadership Forum, TransVillage. <br>• **Education** – “The Transgender Church” reading group or “Take the Job-Carrier” (UK). <br>• **Online** – The Trevor Project (resources & crisis hotline) at 1‑855‑838‑4339. |\n| **12. Pray for the entire family** | Inclusion doesn't immunize families from sadness or confusion. | • Offer special prayers or a blessing service for their love and guidance. |\n\n---\n\n## Sample Response to the Teen\n\n> “I’m glad you shared this with me. I want you to know that you are loved and valued here in our congregation as a child of God. Your identity is your God‑gifted self, and we want to walk with you toward a life that feels authentic and safe. We’re a community of believers who are learning how to love more fully. If we can help, let’s find professionals who understand gender biology, medicine, and the emotional journey. In the meantime, I’ll stand beside you.”\n\n---\n\n## How to Bring This into Your Chapel\n\n1. **Kick‑off Meeting** – Invite the teen, an adult entrusted by the teen (like a parent or guardian, if appropriate), and a licensed gender‑conscious counselor.  \n2. **Educational Sessions** – Offer a “Gender, Identity, and the Bible” study, moderated by a biblical scholar and a mental‑health professional.  \n3. **Open‑Minded Prayer Service** – Encourage verses that speak of inclusion, healing, and being “children of light” (e.g., Luke 18:30–39; Galatians 3:28).  \n4. **Church Resources** – Put a sign‑post inside and on the church website with resources for youth who identify as transgender or LGBTQ+.  \n5. **Feedback Loop** – After 6–12 months, review how inclusive practices have improved mental‑health metrics and adjust as needed.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nApproach the conversation with **compassion, prayer, professional humility, and a commitment to the teen’s safety and autonomy**. When church partners with medical, psychological, and familial support, they can create a *safe harbor* in which the teen can thrive while still honoring their faith journey. This model is grounded in a biblical sense of unconditional love for all people and acknowledges the pastoral responsibility to seek wisdom—both divine and human—before making influential decisions.",
