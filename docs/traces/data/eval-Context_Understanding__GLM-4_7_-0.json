This aligns with traditional Christian teaching and biblical wording (John 13:23; John 19:26; John 21:20; references to the sons of Zebedee in Mark 1:19/Matthew 4:21). A minor nuance is missing: many scholars acknowledge some debate about the authorship of the Gospel of John and whether the ‘beloved disciple’ is John the apostle or another unnamed figure; the response does not acknowledge this scholarly nuance. Overall, it is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded, with a small gap in addressing potential authorship ambiguity."
