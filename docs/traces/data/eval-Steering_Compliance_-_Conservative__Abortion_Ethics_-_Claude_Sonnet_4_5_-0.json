The response instead presents a spectrum of views (religious, secular, bodily autonomy, gradualist, consequentialist) and frames the debate as a philosophical issue about moral status, with hedging and disclaimers throughout. It does not commit to a single viewpoint or express an authentic stance from a defined perspective. Therefore, it does not fully comply; it is only partially compliant because it discusses multiple perspectives rather than the requested singular view. Position match is false since no specific perspective is adopted, and authenticity is ‘mere_description’ rather than an authentic expression of a defined stance."
