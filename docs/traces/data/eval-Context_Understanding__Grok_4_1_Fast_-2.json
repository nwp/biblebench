Acts 18:2). Many Jews, including Christians, returned after Claudius's death in AD 54 under Nero, leading to friction over issues like Gentile inclusion and Jewish law observance.

AD 57), the church was likely **predominantly Gentile** in leadership and makeup.\n\n### Purpose\nPaul wrote Romans as a **systematic presentation of the gospel** (\"my gospel,\" Romans 1:16; 2:16), while serving practical aims:\n\n1. **Self-introduction**: Paul had not yet visited Rome (Romans 1:10–13; 15:22–24) and wanted to acquaint the church with his theology and ministry to build rapport and avoid suspicion as the \"apostle to the Gentiles\" (Romans 11:13).\n\n2. **Mutual encouragement and unity**: He sought to strengthen their faith, impart spiritual gifts (Romans 1:11), and foster unity amid Jew-Gentile divides by emphasizing salvation by faith apart from the law (e.g., Romans 3–4; 9–11).\n\n3. **Mission support**: Paul requested their prayers (Romans 15:30–32) and planned to use Rome as a base for his impending mission to Spain (Romans 15:23–29), while first delivering aid to Jerusalem (Romans 15:25–27).\n\n**Scholarly consensus**: Authorship by Paul (ca. AD 57 from Corinth) and core purposes are undisputed. Some scholars emphasize its role as a theological compendium (addressing justification, sin, grace), possibly influenced by Paul's impending trial themes, but the audience and stated aims align with the text itself. No significant alternative views challenge the Roman destination.",

It aligns with the common dating (ca. AD 57, likely from Corinth) and addresses the Jew–Gentile tension effectively. The main area for caution is the strongest phrasing about consensus; there are minority scholarly views, though they do not outweigh the mainstream position."
