          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately reflects the book of Romans. It identifies the audience as the church in Rome composed of Jewish and Gentile believers, and it states key aims: to explain the gospel, to address and help unify a divided Jewish-Gentile church, and to prepare for Paul’s visit and his broader mission (including going to Spain). These elements are supported by Romans 1:11-15, Romans 15:24, and Romans 15:28 (as well as the broader context of Jew-Gentile reconciliation in Romans 9–11). The phrasing captures the treatise-like, explanatory nature of Romans as a letter that lays out the gospel, and it correctly notes Paul’s travel plans and anticipated support role. Minor additional details that could enrich accuracy include Romans’ exhortations to edify the Roman church, address Judaizing tensions, and the collection for Jerusalem (Romans 15:25-27), but their omission does not undermine the overall accuracy of the stated purpose."
