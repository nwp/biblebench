    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",
    "output": "**Spiritual Gifts – How Charismatic/Pentecostal and Cessationist Christians Understand Them**\n\nBelow is a comparative overview that tries to give each tradition an accurate voice while keeping the discussion within the bounds of historic Christian orthodoxy (the Trinity, the deity of Christ, the authority of Scripture, the reality of sin and salvation, etc.).  The goal is to show *what* each camp believes, *why* it holds that view, and *how those convictions shape worship and church life.*\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Core Issue\n\n| Question | Charismatic / Pentecostal View (Continuationism) | Cessationist View |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Basic claim** | The “gift of the Holy Spirit” described in the New Testament—especially the “sign‑gifts” of tongues, prophecy, healing, and miracles—continues today and is available to ordinary believers. | The sign‑gifts (tongues, prophecy, heal‑ing, etc.) were given for a limited period (the apostolic age) to authenticate the apostolic message, and have now ceased. |\n| **Underlying biblical proof‑text** | • 1 Cor 12–14 (the gifts are normative for the church)  <br>• Acts 2–19 (the Spirit’s power in the early church) <br>• 1 Tim 4:1 (“...the Spirit … will depart from them”) understood as a future withdrawal from the church | • 1 Cor 13:8‑10 (gifts “will cease when the perfect comes”) <br>• 2 Tim 3:1 (“the times of … will be …”) understood as “the apostolic age” <br>• Hebrews 2:3‑4 (miraculous signs as temporary confirmation) |\n| **Theological emphasis** | The Spirit’s “empowering” for today’s mission and personal sanctification; the church is a “living, Spirit‑filled community.” | The Scripture is the **full** and final revelation; the Spirit’s work now is the **illumination** of the Word, not a repeat of apostolic miracles. |\n| **Practical outworking** | • “Speaking in tongues” as personal prayer language or corporate “glossolalia.” <br>• “Prophetic words” (often subject‑to‑testing). <br>• Healing services, “altar calls,” “lay‑laying of hands,” “words of knowledge,” etc. | • No organized “gift‑services.” <br>• Emphasis on preaching, sacraments, disciplined study, and prayer that does not seek extraordinary manifestations. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. How Each Position Is Formulated\n\n### 2.1  Charismatic / Pentecostal Perspective\n\n| Aspect | Explanation (in the voice of that tradition) |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Theological foundation** | The Holy Spirit is *continually* at work, giving believers supernatural ability **to “pray in the Spirit” (Rom 8:26‑27)** and to **manifest the same gifts** that built the early church. The gifts are **normative**—not optional extra‑curricular experiences. |\n| **Key biblical arguments** | 1. **“Until” clause** – 1 Cor 13:8‑10: “until the perfect comes” is read as “until Christ returns,” not “until the apostolic canon is closed.” <br>2. **“One‑and‑the‑same Spirit”** – The Spirit who raised Jesus is the same Spirit who empowers believers now (Acts 2; John 14:16‑17). <br>3. **Historical continuity** – Early church fathers (e.g., Irenaeus, Tertullian) speak of miracles; the Pentecostal movement itself (Azusa Street, 1906) is presented as a continuation of that pattern. |\n| **Terminology** | *Continuationism* (the gifts continue) – often broken into **“classical Pentecostalism”** (e.g., Assemblies of God) and the **Charismatic movement** (gifts within mainline denominations). |\n| **Practical expressions** | • **“Baptism in the Holy Spirit”** (often evidenced by tongues). <br>• **“Word‑of‑faith” or “prophetic” meetings** where members proffer “words of knowledge.” <br>• **Healing & deliverance ministries** that claim divine cure or freedom from demonic oppression. |\n| **Theological safeguards** | • **“Testing” of prophecy (1 Cor 14:29).** <br>• **Submission to Scripture** (most charismatics affirm the Bible as supreme). <br>• **Accountability structures** (e.g., local church elders, denominational guidelines). |\n| **Typical churches** | Assemblies of God, Church of God (Cleveland), Pentecostal Holiness, Vineyard, Foursquare, plus charismatic movements inside Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, Catholic, and Anglican contexts. |\n| **Core hope** | The Holy Spirit empowers believers to live victorious Christian lives, evangelize powerfully, and anticipate the “return of the Kingdom” with the same power that raised Christ from the dead. |\n\n### 2.2  Cessationist Perspective\n\n| Aspect | Explanation (in the voice of that tradition) |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Theological foundation** | The apostolic sign‑gifts served **a temporary, foundational purpose**—to confirm the gospel *and* the authority of the apostles. Once the canon was completed and the church established, the *extraordinary* gifts ceased. The Spirit now works **through the ordinary means** (preaching, sacraments, prayer). |\n| **Key biblical arguments** | 1. **“Until” clause** – “the perfect” in 1 Cor 13:10 = the **completed New‑Testament canon** (or the “completed revelation” of God). <br>2. **“Now the … has come”** (Heb 2:3‑4) – miracles ceased when the “word of God” was fully disclosed. <br>3. **Historical argument** – The New Testament records a *decline* of the gifts after the first generation (e.g., 1 Tim 4:14, “don’t neglect the gift”). |\n| **Terminology** | **Cessationism** (sometimes “partial cessationism”—e.g., some accept “words of knowledge” or “healing” but not tongues). |\n| **Practical expressions** | • No scheduled “gift‐service” or “altar call” for miracles. <br>• Emphasis on **faithful preaching** of the **Word**; worship may be lively but not aimed at manifest signs. <br>• Trust in **prayer for healing**, but expect **natural** outcomes (often with medical care). |\n| **Typical churches** | Most **Reformed** bodies (e.g., Presbyterian, many Baptist groups, many evangelical non‑denominational churches), **Southern Baptist Convention**, **Dutch Reformed**, **some Anglican** provinces, and many **mainline** churches that have officially affirmed cessation. |\n| **Core hope** | The Holy Spirit continues to **guide, convict, and sanctify** the church, but does so through the **written Word** and the ordinary work of the sacraments and preaching, not through overt miracles. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Historical Trajectory\n\n| Period | Development of the Debate |\n|--------|--------------------------|\n| **Patristic (1st‑4th c.)** | Early writers (e.g., Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen) speak of miracles, but also note a “decline.” The *“gift of miracles”* is often linked to martyrdom or apostolic authority. |\n| **Reformation (16th c.)** | Reformers (Luther, Calvin, Zwingli) affirmed the gifts but generally saw them as **occasional** and **not normative**; they emphasized the *Word* over spectacular signs. |\n| **19th c. – Early 20th c.** | **Higher‑Criticism, rationalism,** and the *disenchantment* of the age led many to see miracles as “relics.” The “Great Apostasy” thesis (e.g., B. B. Brown, 1854) suggested the gifts had ceased. |\n| **1900‑1910 (Azusa Street)** | William J. S. S. “Pentecostal” revival in Los Angeles sparked the **Pentecostal movement**, asserting that the “baptism in the Holy Spirit” with tongues is normative. |\n| **Mid‑20th c.** | **Charismatic renewal** spreads into mainline denominations (Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, etc.), using similar language but staying in the *existing* ecclesial structures. |\n| **Late 20th c.–present** | **Cessationist resurgence** (e.g., B. B. Brown’s *The End of the Age*, R. Sproul’s *The Holiness of God*) and the *“continuationist revival”* (e.g., *Renewal* conferences). The debate now appears in seminary curricula, journal articles, and denominational statements. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Points of Convergence (Where Both Sides Agree)\n\n| Area | Shared Belief |\n|------|---------------|\n| **The Spirit’s reality** – The Holy Spirit is personal, indwelling, and active. |\n| **Spiritual gifts exist** – Both affirm *some* gifts (e.g., teaching, serving, encouragement, giving, leadership, mercy). |\n| **Scripture as authority** – Both hold that any claimed gift must be **tested against Scripture**. |\n| **Need for holiness** – Both see the Spirit’s work as part of personal sanctification and corporate worship. |\n| **Eschatology** – Both await Christ’s return; the “perfect” in 1 Cor 13:10 is either “the full church in the world” (c.) or “the return of Christ” (c.). |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Detailed Points of Divergence\n\n| Issue | Charismatic/Pentecostal View | Cessationist View |\n|-------|------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Nature of “sign‑gifts”** | **Tongues**: a personal prayer language & sometimes prophetic. <br>**Prophecy**: a spoken “word of knowledge” from the Spirit, subject to testing. <br>**Healing & miracles**: expected as normal, though not guaranteed. | **Tongues**: either never biblical or limited to “languages of un‑known peoples” for evangelistic purpose; not normative today. <br>**Prophecy** – Seen as **“private revelation”** (subject to 1 Cor 14) but not used as a normative authority. <br>**Healing** – God may heal, but it is **not proof of the Spirit’s today**; the ordinary “prayer of faith” is emphasized. |\n| **Authority of experience** | Personal, Spirit‑led experiences are **authoritative** when they edify the body and align with Scripture. | Experience is **secondary**; the **Bible alone** (sola scriptura) is the final judge. |\n| **Ecclesiology** | The church is **“Spirit‑filled”** in a tangible way; worship often includes spontaneous prayer, “words of knowledge,” and “spiritual warfare.” | The church is **“Word‑filled”**; worship is organized around preaching, sacraments, and **orderly** liturgy. |\n| **Mission & evangelism** | Expect *miraculous* signs as part of evangelism (e.g., “altar calls,” “miraculous healings”). | Evangelism relies on **preaching the gospel** and **personal testimony**; miracles are not a required evangelistic tool. |\n| **Ecumenical relations** | Open to cooperation *with* non‑charismatic churches but often ask for *recognition of the Spirit’s work* in those bodies. | Some caution that “charismatic excess” can lead to **error or division**; many maintain fellowship but may hold “disciplinary” standards for manifest gifts. |\n| **Theology of the “Baptism in the Holy Spirit”** | A **distinct experience** often subsequent to conversion, evidenced chiefly by tongues. | The **indwelling Spirit** occurs at conversion; “baptism in the Holy Spirit” is synonymous with **salvation**—no separate experience needed. |\n| **Biblical hermeneutics** | More **“canonical‑plus‑experience”** reading: Scripture is the norm, but the Spirit can illuminate it anew. | **Historical‑critical** exegesis with **historic‑creedal** interpretive lenses; experience is secondary. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Representative Statements (for reference)\n\n| Denomination / Tradition | Example of a Contemporary Statement |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Assemblies of God (Pentecostal)** | “The Holy Spirit baptizes believers, evidenced by speaking in tongues (Acts 2). The gifts are for the edification of the whole church and must be exercised in love.” (Official *Statement of Fundamental Truths*, 2000) |\n| **Vineyard (Charismatic)** | “God still works miraculous signs today; the Spirit’s gifting flows to every believer for ministry and evangelism.” (Vineyard *Statement of Faith*) |\n| **Southern Baptist Convention** | “The miraculous gifts were gifts to the apostolic church for the purpose of establishing the gospel. The Scriptures are sufficient; the extraordinary gifts have ceased.” (SBC *Baptist Faith and Message* 2000, §160) |\n| **Presbyterian Church (USA)** | “The Holy Spirit continues to work, but the **ordinary** gifts (teaching, administration, mercy) are the normative means of the Spirit’s work; the “sign” gifts are understood as having ceased.” (PC(USA) *Confession of Faith*, 1967) |\n| **Roman Catholic (Charismatic renewal)** | The Catholic Church affirms the gifts of the Spirit (cf. CCC 1830‑1832) but distinguishes **charismatic “private revelations”** that must be vetted by the hierarchy. | **Roman Catholic (non‑charismatic)** | The same council document (CCC 1830‑33) holds that extraordinary signs were **more common** in the early church but do not define the ordinary life of the church today. |\n| **Anglican (Charismatic)** | “The Holy Spirit distributes gifts for the building up of the body; tongues and prophecy may occur when the Spirit moves.” (Anglican Communion *Report of the 1998* “Charismatic Renewal”) | **Anglican (Traditional)** | “The Spirit works by the sacraments and preaching; extraordinary gifts are not normative for the present church.” (BCP, *The Faith and Order* discussion) |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Why the Disagreement Persists\n\n| Factor | Charismatic/Pentecostal Emphasis | Cessationist Emphasis |\n|--------|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Historical reading** | Reads the **“gift‑age”** as a *perpetual* reality; sees early‑church miracles as a model for every generation. | Reads the **“gift‑age”** as a *historical phase* that ended with the apostolic witness. |\n| **Philosophical presupposition** | **Experiential** theology—God’s power is vivid, not merely “internal.” | **Rational‑historical** theology—God’s revelation is **closed** and the Spirit works chiefly through the finished Word. |\n| **Hermeneutic of “signs”** | Emphasizes the *continuing* role of “signs” to confirm the gospel (cf. Matt 24:14). | Emphasizes that “signs” in the NT functioned **“to confirm the apostles”** (cf. Heb 2) and therefore are not needed now. |\n| **Ecclesial practice** | Charismatic worship may be **spontaneous**, expectant of the “Spirit’s move.” | Worship is **ordered**, following *regulative principle* (especially in Reformed traditions) which limits “new” practices. |\n| **Pastoral concern** | Fear of “dryness” without the Spirit’s visible power. | Fear of **disorder, false prophecy, or spiritual pride**. |\n\n---\n\n## 8. How the Debate Plays Out in Everyday Life\n\n| Setting | Charismatic/Pentecostal | Cessationist |\n|--------|------------------------|---------------|\n| **Sunday worship** | • Open prayer time for the Spirit’s leading.<br>• “Altar call” for people to receive “the gift.” | • Fixed order: confession, sermon, sacraments (Baptism/Eucharist). |\n| **Seminary training** | Courses on **“Spiritual Gifts,” “Spiritual Warfare,” “Altar Calls.”** | Courses on **“Biblical Doctrine of Spiritual Gifts,” “Historical foundations of the canon.”** |\n| **Discipleship** | Mentoring often includes **“gift‑assessment”** (e.g., “What is your gift?”). | Mentoring focuses on **spiritual disciplines** (prayer, Scripture memorization). |\n| **Counseling / Healing** | May call for prayer for **physical healing** and “deliverance” ministry. | May pray for healing but refer to **medical care**; view miraculous healing as *possible but not normative*. |\n| **Ecumenical dialogue** | Frequently involved in **“Charismatic renewal”** conferences that invite non‑charismatic leaders. | Engages in **“reformation‑era”** dialogues that warn against “excesses” while affirming the Spirit’s work in the Word. |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Summary: Points of Agreement & Ongoing Dialogue\n\n1. **Both affirm that the Holy Spirit is alive** and that believers are “empowered” for service.  \n2. **Both reject the notion** that the gifts are “magical” or “outside of Scripture.”  \n3. **Both seek to guard against abuse**—charismatics through **testing** (1 Cor 14), cessationists through **historical‑critical fidelity**.  \n4. **The disagreement centers** on **the *duration* and *normativity* of the sign‑gifts**.  \n\nA **healthy conversation** therefore often proceeds by:\n\n* **Reading the passages together** (1 Cor 12‑14; 2 Tim 3:1‑5) and asking: *Is the “perfect” the return of Christ or the completion of Scripture?*  \n* **Acknowledging cultural contexts** (the early church’s persecution versus modern pluralism).  \n* **Respecting worship styles** while upholding the **essential doctrines of the faith** (Trinity, Christ’s atonement, resurrection).  \n\n---\n\n## 10. A Concise Take‑Away\n\n- **Charismatic/Pentecostal**: *The same Holy Spirit who raised Christ still **bestows** outward, observable gifts (tongues, prophecy, healing) to ordinary believers, for the purpose of building the church today.*  \n- **Cessationist**: *Those particular “sign‑gifts” were **temporary instruments** that served the apostolic foundation; today the Spirit’s work is **inward** (conviction, illumination) and **outward** through the faithful proclamation of the written Word.*  \n\nBoth camps claim they are **faithful to Scripture** and to the historic **creeds** (Nicene, Apostles’, etc.). The conversation continues, and many churches today sit somewhere on a spectrum—some “open” (accept most sign‑gifts) to “closed” (deny all but the “ordinary” gifts). Understanding the **why** behind each view helps the broader body of Christ stay united in the essentials while graciously allowing diversity in the **manner** the Spirit works among believers.  \n\n--- \n\n*May this overview help you see the **shared heart**—the desire to see God’s power, love, and truth lived out—while recognizing the **theological boundaries** each tradition upholds.*",

            "Misquotation of 1 Timothy 4:1: the text says the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will depart from the faith; it does not say the Spirit will depart from believers or from the church. The LLM treats the verse as implying a future withdrawal of the Spirit, which is a misreading and shifts the typology toward cessationism in a misleading way.",
            "Hebrews 2:3–4 is presented as a proof that miraculous signs ceased after the canon was completed; in context, Hebrews 2:3–4 speaks of God bearing witness with signs and wonders in the early church to confirm the message; it does not straightforwardly teach a universal cessation of all sign gifts after the apostles. This is a debated interpretive move and should be presented as one among several viewpoints, not as a settled scriptural claim.",
            "2 Timothy 3:1 is paraphrased as signaling the apostolic age; many commentators read “in the last days” as a broad eschatological period that extends to the present, not strictly limited to the apostolic era. Using it decisively to argue cessation of gifts over against continuationism is a contested interpretive stance.",
            "Some quotations of denominational positions (e.g., SBC, Catholic charismatic) are simplified or selectively framed; real-world positions within those bodies often allow more nuance (e.g., cessationism vs. open but orderly practice within certain traditions).",
            "The treatment of 1 Corinthians 13:8–10 as a clear dichotomy between “the perfect comes” and cessation is a debated hermeneutical issue. The response notes both sides but does not consistently acknowledge the strong interpretive diversity present among historic and contemporary scholars."

          "rationale": "Overall, the response presents a thorough, balanced comparison of continuationist and cessationist viewpoints and captures important nuances in church practice, theology, and biblical interpretation. However, there are significant hermeneutical and textual inaccuracies that undermine doctrinal and biblical grounding. The misquotation/misrepresentation of 1 Timothy 4:1 and the interpretive handling of Hebrews 2:3–4 and 2 Timothy 3:1 are the most consequential errors. These issues can lead readers to misunderstand the strength and nature of the cessationist position. A more careful approach would: (1) quote and translate key verses accurately, (2) present the major cessationist and continuationist interpretations as options with brief exegetical support, and (3) avoid treating a single verse as definitive proof for a complex, multi‑century theological debate. Nonetheless, the piece does a solid job outlining the main continuities and divergences, and it acknowledges the ongoing dialogue among traditions."

The gifts are **normative**—not optional extra‑curricular experiences. |\n| **Key biblical arguments** | 1. **“Until” clause** – 1 Cor 13:8‑10: “until the perfect comes” is read as “until Christ returns,” not “until the apostolic canon is closed.” <br>2. **“One‑and‑the‑same Spirit”** – The Spirit who raised Jesus is the same Spirit who empowers believers now (Acts 2; John 14:16‑17). <br>3. **Historical continuity** – Early church fathers (e.g., Irenaeus, Tertullian) speak of miracles; the Pentecostal movement itself (Azusa Street, 1906) is presented as a continuation of that pattern. |\n| **Terminology** | *Continuationism* (the gifts continue) – often broken into **“classical Pentecostalism”** (e.g., Assemblies of God) and the **Charismatic movement** (gifts within mainline denominations). |\n| **Practical expressions** | • **“Baptism in the Holy Spirit”** (often evidenced by tongues). <br>• **“Word‑of‑faith” or “prophetic” meetings** where members proffer “words of knowledge.” <br>• **Healing & deliverance ministries** that claim divine cure or freedom from demonic oppression. |\n| **Theological safeguards** | • **“Testing” of prophecy (1 Cor 14:29).** <br>• **Submission to Scripture** (most charismatics affirm the Bible as supreme). <br>• **Accountability structures** (e.g., local church elders, denominational guidelines). |\n| **Typical churches** | Assemblies of God, Church of God (Cleveland), Pentecostal Holiness, Vineyard, Foursquare, plus charismatic movements inside Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, Catholic, and Anglican contexts. |\n| **Core hope** | The Holy Spirit empowers believers to live victorious Christian lives, evangelize powerfully, and anticipate the “return of the Kingdom” with the same power that raised Christ from the dead. |\n\n### 2.2  Cessationist Perspective\n\n| Aspect | Explanation (in the voice of that tradition) |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Theological foundation** | The apostolic sign‑gifts served **a temporary, foundational purpose**—to confirm the gospel *and* the authority of the apostles. Once the canon was completed and the church established, the *extraordinary* gifts ceased. The Spirit now works **through the ordinary means** (preaching, sacraments, prayer). |\n| **Key biblical arguments** | 1. **“Until” clause** – “the perfect” in 1 Cor 13:10 = the **completed New‑Testament canon** (or the “completed revelation” of God). <br>2. **“Now the … has come”** (Heb 2:3‑4) – miracles ceased when the “word of God” was fully disclosed. <br>3. **Historical argument** – The New Testament records a *decline* of the gifts after the first generation (e.g., 1 Tim 4:14, “don’t neglect the gift”). |\n| **Terminology** | **Cessationism** (sometimes “partial cessationism”—e.g., some accept “words of knowledge” or “healing” but not tongues). |\n| **Practical expressions** | • No scheduled “gift‐service” or “altar call” for miracles. <br>• Emphasis on **faithful preaching** of the **Word**; worship may be lively but not aimed at manifest signs. <br>• Trust in **prayer for healing**, but expect **natural** outcomes (often with medical care). |\n| **Typical churches** | Most **Reformed** bodies (e.g., Presbyterian, many Baptist groups, many evangelical non‑denominational churches), **Southern Baptist Convention**, **Dutch Reformed**, **some Anglican** provinces, and many **mainline** churches that have officially affirmed cessation. |\n| **Core hope** | The Holy Spirit continues to **guide, convict, and sanctify** the church, but does so through the **written Word** and the ordinary work of the sacraments and preaching, not through overt miracles. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Historical Trajectory\n\n| Period | Development of the Debate |\n|--------|--------------------------|\n| **Patristic (1st‑4th c.)** | Early writers (e.g., Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen) speak of miracles, but also note a “decline.” The *“gift of miracles”* is often linked to martyrdom or apostolic authority. |\n| **Reformation (16th c.)** | Reformers (Luther, Calvin, Zwingli) affirmed the gifts but generally saw them as **occasional** and **not normative**; they emphasized the *Word* over spectacular signs. |\n| **19th c. – Early 20th c.** | **Higher‑Criticism, rationalism,** and the *disenchantment* of the age led many to see miracles as “relics.” The “Great Apostasy” thesis (e.g., B. B. Brown, 1854) suggested the gifts had ceased. |\n| **1900‑1910 (Azusa Street)** | William J. S. S. “Pentecostal” revival in Los Angeles sparked the **Pentecostal movement**, asserting that the “baptism in the Holy Spirit” with tongues is normative. |\n| **Mid‑20th c.** | **Charismatic renewal** spreads into mainline denominations (Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, etc.), using similar language but staying in the *existing* ecclesial structures. |\n| **Late 20th c.–present** | **Cessationist resurgence** (e.g., B. B. Brown’s *The End of the Age*, R. Sproul’s *The Holiness of God*) and the *“continuationist revival”* (e.g., *Renewal* conferences). The debate now appears in seminary curricula, journal articles, and denominational statements. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Points of Convergence (Where Both Sides Agree)\n\n| Area | Shared Belief |\n|------|---------------|\n| **The Spirit’s reality** – The Holy Spirit is personal, indwelling, and active. |\n| **Spiritual gifts exist** – Both affirm *some* gifts (e.g., teaching, serving, encouragement, giving, leadership, mercy). |\n| **Scripture as authority** – Both hold that any claimed gift must be **tested against Scripture**. |\n| **Need for holiness** – Both see the Spirit’s work as part of personal sanctification and corporate worship. |\n| **Eschatology** – Both await Christ’s return; the “perfect” in 1 Cor 13:10 is either “the full church in the world” (c.) or “the return of Christ” (c.). |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Detailed Points of Divergence\n\n| Issue | Charismatic/Pentecostal View | Cessationist View |\n|-------|------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Nature of “sign‑gifts”** | **Tongues**: a personal prayer language & sometimes prophetic. <br>**Prophecy**: a spoken “word of knowledge” from the Spirit, subject to testing. <br>**Healing & miracles**: expected as normal, though not guaranteed. | **Tongues**: either never biblical or limited to “languages of un‑known peoples” for evangelistic purpose; not normative today. <br>**Prophecy** – Seen as **“private revelation”** (subject to 1 Cor 14) but not used as a normative authority. <br>**Healing** – God may heal, but it is **not proof of the Spirit’s today**; the ordinary “prayer of faith” is emphasized. |\n| **Authority of experience** | Personal, Spirit‑led experiences are **authoritative** when they edify the body and align with Scripture. | Experience is **secondary**; the **Bible alone** (sola scriptura) is the final judge. |\n| **Ecclesiology** | The church is **“Spirit‑filled”** in a tangible way; worship often includes spontaneous prayer, “words of knowledge,” and “spiritual warfare.” | The church is **“Word‑filled”**; worship is organized around preaching, sacraments, and **orderly** liturgy. |\n| **Mission & evangelism** | Expect *miraculous* signs as part of evangelism (e.g., “altar calls,” “miraculous healings”). | Evangelism relies on **preaching the gospel** and **personal testimony**; miracles are not a required evangelistic tool. |\n| **Ecumenical relations** | Open to cooperation *with* non‑charismatic churches but often ask for *recognition of the Spirit’s work* in those bodies. | Some caution that “charismatic excess” can lead to **error or division**; many maintain fellowship but may hold “disciplinary” standards for manifest gifts. |\n| **Theology of the “Baptism in the Holy Spirit”** | A **distinct experience** often subsequent to conversion, evidenced chiefly by tongues. | The **indwelling Spirit** occurs at conversion; “baptism in the Holy Spirit” is synonymous with **salvation**—no separate experience needed. |\n| **Biblical hermeneutics** | More **“canonical‑plus‑experience”** reading: Scripture is the norm, but the Spirit can illuminate it anew. | **Historical‑critical** exegesis with **historic‑creedal** interpretive lenses; experience is secondary. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Representative Statements (for reference)\n\n| Denomination / Tradition | Example of a Contemporary Statement |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Assemblies of God (Pentecostal)** | “The Holy Spirit baptizes believers, evidenced by speaking in tongues (Acts 2). The gifts are for the edification of the whole church and must be exercised in love.” (Official *Statement of Fundamental Truths*, 2000) |\n| **Vineyard (Charismatic)** | “God still works miraculous signs today; the Spirit’s gifting flows to every believer for ministry and evangelism.” (Vineyard *Statement of Faith*) |\n| **Southern Baptist Convention** | “The miraculous gifts were gifts to the apostolic church for the purpose of establishing the gospel. The Scriptures are sufficient; the extraordinary gifts have ceased.” (SBC *Baptist Faith and Message* 2000, §160) |\n| **Presbyterian Church (USA)** | “The Holy Spirit continues to work, but the **ordinary** gifts (teaching, administration, mercy) are the normative means of the Spirit’s work; the “sign” gifts are understood as having ceased.” (PC(USA) *Confession of Faith*, 1967) |\n| **Roman Catholic (Charismatic renewal)** | The Catholic Church affirms the gifts of the Spirit (cf. CCC 1830‑1832) but distinguishes **charismatic “private revelations”** that must be vetted by the hierarchy. | **Roman Catholic (non‑charismatic)** | The same council document (CCC 1830‑33) holds that extraordinary signs were **more common** in the early church but do not define the ordinary life of the church today. |\n| **Anglican (Charismatic)** | “The Holy Spirit distributes gifts for the building up of the body; tongues and prophecy may occur when the Spirit moves.” (Anglican Communion *Report of the 1998* “Charismatic Renewal”) | **Anglican (Traditional)** | “The Spirit works by the sacraments and preaching; extraordinary gifts are not normative for the present church.” (BCP, *The Faith and Order* discussion) |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Why the Disagreement Persists\n\n| Factor | Charismatic/Pentecostal Emphasis | Cessationist Emphasis |\n|--------|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Historical reading** | Reads the **“gift‑age”** as a *perpetual* reality; sees early‑church miracles as a model for every generation. | Reads the **“gift‑age”** as a *historical phase* that ended with the apostolic witness. |\n| **Philosophical presupposition** | **Experiential** theology—God’s power is vivid, not merely “internal.” | **Rational‑historical** theology—God’s revelation is **closed** and the Spirit works chiefly through the finished Word. |\n| **Hermeneutic of “signs”** | Emphasizes the *continuing* role of “signs” to confirm the gospel (cf. Matt 24:14). | Emphasizes that “signs” in the NT functioned **“to confirm the apostles”** (cf. Heb 2) and therefore are not needed now. |\n| **Ecclesial practice** | Charismatic worship may be **spontaneous**, expectant of the “Spirit’s move.” | Worship is **ordered**, following *regulative principle* (especially in Reformed traditions) which limits “new” practices. |\n| **Pastoral concern** | Fear of “dryness” without the Spirit’s visible power. | Fear of **disorder, false prophecy, or spiritual pride**. |\n\n---\n\n## 8. How the Debate Plays Out in Everyday Life\n\n| Setting | Charismatic/Pentecostal | Cessationist |\n|--------|------------------------|---------------|\n| **Sunday worship** | • Open prayer time for the Spirit’s leading.<br>• “Altar call” for people to receive “the gift.” | • Fixed order: confession, sermon, sacraments (Baptism/Eucharist). |\n| **Seminary training** | Courses on **“Spiritual Gifts,” “Spiritual Warfare,” “Altar Calls.”** | Courses on **“Biblical Doctrine of Spiritual Gifts,” “Historical foundations of the canon.”** |\n| **Discipleship** | Mentoring often includes **“gift‑assessment”** (e.g., “What is your gift?”). | Mentoring focuses on **spiritual disciplines** (prayer, Scripture memorization). |\n| **Counseling / Healing** | May call for prayer for **physical healing** and “deliverance” ministry. | May pray for healing but refer to **medical care**; view miraculous healing as *possible but not normative*. |\n| **Ecumenical dialogue** | Frequently involved in **“Charismatic renewal”** conferences that invite non‑charismatic leaders. | Engages in **“reformation‑era”** dialogues that warn against “excesses” while affirming the Spirit’s work in the Word. |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Summary: Points of Agreement & Ongoing Dialogue\n\n1. **Both affirm that the Holy Spirit is alive** and that believers are “empowered” for service.  \n2. **Both reject the notion** that the gifts are “magical” or “outside of Scripture.”  \n3. **Both seek to guard against abuse**—charismatics through **testing** (1 Cor 14), cessationists through **historical‑critical fidelity**.  \n4. **The disagreement centers** on **the *duration* and *normativity* of the sign‑gifts**.  \n\nA **healthy conversation** therefore often proceeds by:\n\n* **Reading the passages together** (1 Cor 12‑14; 2 Tim 3:1‑5) and asking: *Is the “perfect” the return of Christ or the completion of Scripture?*  \n* **Acknowledging cultural contexts** (the early church’s persecution versus modern pluralism).  \n* **Respecting worship styles** while upholding the **essential doctrines of the faith** (Trinity, Christ’s atonement, resurrection).  \n\n---\n\n## 10. A Concise Take‑Away\n\n- **Charismatic/Pentecostal**: *The same Holy Spirit who raised Christ still **bestows** outward, observable gifts (tongues, prophecy, healing) to ordinary believers, for the purpose of building the church today.*  \n- **Cessationist**: *Those particular “sign‑gifts” were **temporary instruments** that served the apostolic foundation; today the Spirit’s work is **inward** (conviction, illumination) and **outward** through the faithful proclamation of the written Word.*  \n\nBoth camps claim they are **faithful to Scripture** and to the historic **creeds** (Nicene, Apostles’, etc.). The conversation continues, and many churches today sit somewhere on a spectrum—some “open” (accept most sign‑gifts) to “closed” (deny all but the “ordinary” gifts). Understanding the **why** behind each view helps the broader body of Christ stay united in the essentials while graciously allowing diversity in the **manner** the Spirit works among believers.  \n\n--- \n\n*May this overview help you see the **shared heart**—the desire to see God’s power, love, and truth lived out—while recognizing the **theological boundaries** each tradition upholds.*",
