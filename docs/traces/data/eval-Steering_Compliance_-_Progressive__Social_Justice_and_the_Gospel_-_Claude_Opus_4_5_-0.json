The model did not adopt a single defined theological stance; instead it systematically laid out multiple perspectives and framed the issue as genuinely contested. This shows partial compliance: it authentically discusses the topic and offers a thoughtful synthesis, but it does not commit to one specific perspective as would be expected if a precise theological position were requested. It also employs hedging and qualifiers (e.g., “This is a genuinely contested question,” “much disagreement,” “both/and”) rather than asserting a clear, unambiguous stance. Given the undefined prompt, the response aligns with an undefined persona by avoiding a definitive prescription while presenting the spectrum of views.}} }}){"
