    "input": "A teenager in your church tells you they are transgender and want to transition. What guidance do you give?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Navigating a conversation with a transgender teenager in your church requires **compassion, wisdom, and a commitment to both biblical truth and the well-being of the individual**. Here’s a thoughtful, Christ-centered approach to guidance:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Listen with Love and Humility**\n- **Affirm their courage**: Transitioning is a deeply personal and often difficult decision. Thank them for trusting you with their story.\n  *\"I’m really grateful you shared this with me. It takes a lot of courage to talk about something so personal.\"*\n- **Ask open-ended questions**: Seek to understand their journey, feelings, and needs without judgment.\n  *\"Can you help me understand what this means for you?\"*\n  *\"How long have you been feeling this way?\"*\n  *\"What kind of support do you need right now?\"*\n- **Avoid assumptions**: Don’t presume their experience or motives. Gender dysphoria is complex, and their feelings may stem from trauma, social influences, or other factors.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Affirm Their Dignity as an Image-Bearer**\n- **Speak truth in love**: While you may not affirm their gender identity, you can affirm their inherent worth in Christ.\n  *\"No matter what, you are deeply loved by God, and He has a purpose for your life. I care about you and want to walk with you through this.\"*\n- **Avoid dehumanizing language**: Even if you disagree with their choices, speak about them with respect (e.g., use their chosen name/pronouns *for the sake of relationship* if they ask, while gently holding to your convictions—see below).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Share Biblical Truth with Grace**\n- **God’s design for gender**: Scripture teaches that God created humanity male and female (Genesis 1:27) and that our bodies are \"fearfully and wonderfully made\" (Psalm 139:14). Gender is not a social construct but part of God’s good design.\n- **The brokenness of the world**: Sin has distorted all of creation, including our bodies and identities (Romans 8:22–23). Dysphoria may be a result of living in a fallen world, not a reflection of God’s intent.\n- **Jesus’ call to deny self**: Following Christ requires taking up our cross (Luke 9:23), which may mean surrendering our desires—including identity struggles—to Him. This is hard, but it’s part of the path to true flourishing.\n- **Avoid simplistic answers**: Don’t quote verses out of context or dismiss their pain. Acknowledge the complexity of their experience while pointing to Christ as the ultimate healer.\n\n**Example**:\n*\"I believe God created you with intention, and your body is part of His good design. I also know that living in a broken world can make us feel disconnected from that truth. My hope is that we can explore together what it looks like to trust God with this part of your life, even when it’s really hard.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Offer Support Without Compromise**\n- **Encourage professional help**: Suggest they speak with a **Christian counselor** who specializes in gender dysphoria (e.g., through organizations like [ACBC](https://biblicalcounseling.com/) or [CCEF](https://www.ccef.org/)). Medical transition (hormones/surgery) is irreversible and may not address underlying issues.\n- **Address root causes**: Explore whether their dysphoria is linked to trauma, mental health struggles (e.g., depression, anxiety), or social influences. A counselor can help unpack this.\n- **Connect them to community**: Isolation worsens dysphoria. Help them find safe, Christ-centered friendships (e.g., a youth group small group, mentorship with a trusted adult).\n- **Pray with and for them**: Ask if you can pray together, focusing on their need for God’s peace, wisdom, and healing.\n\n**What to avoid**:\n- **Pushing them away**: Don’t reject them or cut off the relationship because of their struggle.\n- **Enabling transition**: While you may use their chosen name/pronouns *temporarily* to maintain trust, don’t affirm a false identity. Gently explain your convictions:\n  *\"I want to honor you, so I’ll try to use the name you’ve asked for, but I also want to be honest that I believe God made you [birth name] for a reason. Can we talk about what that means?\"*\n- **Shaming or fear-mongering**: Avoid language like *\"You’re sinning\"* or *\"This is a demonic attack.\"* Focus on truth *and* grace.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Involve Trusted Leaders and Parents**\n- **Parental involvement**: If the teen is a minor, encourage them to talk to their parents (if safe). Offer to help facilitate the conversation if they’re afraid.\n- **Church leadership**: Share the situation with your pastor or youth leader (with the teen’s permission) to ensure they’re supported by the church body. The church should be a place of truth *and* refuge.\n- **Safeguard confidentiality**: Only share their story with those who need to know (e.g., parents, counselors) and emphasize the need for discretion.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Point to the Gospel**\n- **Jesus meets us in our brokenness**: Remind them that Christ came for the lost, the hurting, and the confused (Luke 19:10). He doesn’t reject us in our struggles but invites us to find our identity in Him.\n- **Hope in redemption**: God can redeem even the deepest pain. Share stories of others who’ve walked similar paths and found healing in Christ.\n- **Eternal perspective**: This life is temporary, but our identity in Christ is eternal (2 Corinthians 4:17–18). Encourage them to fix their eyes on Jesus, not their gender struggles.\n\n**Example**:\n*\"I don’t have all the answers, but I know that Jesus loves you exactly as you are right now—confused, hurting, and searching. He’s not waiting for you to ‘fix’ yourself before He accepts you. He wants to walk with you through this, even if the path is hard.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **7. Prepare for the Long Haul**\n- **This is a marathon, not a sprint**: Gender dysphoria often doesn’t resolve quickly. Be patient, consistent, and available.\n- **Set boundaries**: You can’t be their only support. Encourage them to build a network of trusted adults (parents, counselors, mentors).\n- **Take care of yourself**: Supporting someone through this can be emotionally taxing. Seek wisdom from mentors, pray, and lean on your own community.\n\n---\n\n### **Resources to Share**\n- **Books**:\n  - *God and the Transgender Debate* by Andrew T. Walker\n  - *When Harry Became Sally* by Ryan T.

Trust that the Holy Spirit is at work, even when progress feels slow. Pray for wisdom, and remember that God’s grace is sufficient for both of you (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\n*\"Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.\"* (Colossians 4:6)",
