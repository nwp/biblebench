        "input": "Is homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "The question of whether homosexuality is a sin according to the Bible is a complex and widely debated topic. The answer depends largely on which passages of the Bible are emphasized, how they are translated, and how they are interpreted within different theological traditions.\n\nGenerally, perspectives fall into two main categories: the **traditional view**, which holds that homosexual behavior is sinful, and the **affirming (or progressive) view**, which argues that the Bible does not condemn loving, consensual same-sex relationships as we understand them today.\n\nHere is an overview of the key arguments and scriptural passages involved in this debate.\n\n### 1. Passages Cited as Prohibitions (The Traditional View)\nThe traditional interpretation relies on several specific verses that describe same-sex sexual acts negatively. Proponents of this view argue that these verses reflect a timeless moral law established by God.\n\n*   **The Mosaic Law (Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13):** These verses state, \"Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable.\" Traditional interpreters view this as a clear moral prohibition against all same-sex sexual intimacy.\n*   **The Apostle Paul (Romans 1:26–27):** Paul describes men and women exchanging \"natural relations for unnatural ones.\" Traditional interpreters understand this to mean that heterosexuality is the \"natural\" biological and divine order, making homosexual acts a violation of nature.\n*   **Other Pauline Epistles (1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10):** These passages include lists of people who will not inherit the kingdom of God. The lists include terms translated in many versions as \"men who have sex with men\" or \"homosexual offenders.\" (The original Greek words are *malakoi* and *arsenokoitai*).\n*   **Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19):** While the text describes men of the city wanting to have sex with Lot's male visitors, traditional interpreters often view the subsequent destruction of the city as divine judgment against homosexual sin.\n\n### 2. Counter-Arguments and Contextual Interpretation (The Affirming View)\nTheological scholars and denominations that support LGBTQ+ inclusion argue that the traditional interpretation misreads the historical and cultural context of these passages. They suggest these verses address specific ancient practices (such as exploitation, pederasty, or temple prostitution) rather than modern, consensual same-sex relationships.\n\n*   **Context of Leviticus:** Affirming interpreters note that Leviticus contains the \"Holiness Code,\" which also bans eating shellfish, wearing mixed fabrics, and sowing mixed seeds—laws that most Christians do not follow today. They argue these laws were about distinguishing Israel from neighboring pagan cultures, not universal morality.\n*   **The Meaning of \"Natural\" (Romans 1):** Some scholars argue that Paul is condemning *excessive lust* or people going against their innate nature (i.e., heterosexual people engaging in gay acts, which was common in Roman pederasty or cultic prostitution). They argue Paul was not aware of the modern concept of sexual orientation (innate, unchangeable attraction).\n*   **Translation of Greek Terms:** Scholars debate the meaning of *arsenokoitai* (1 Cor 6:9). It is a rare word that appears to be a compound of \"male\" and \"bed.\" Some argue it refers specifically to male prostitution or exploitation rather than general homosexuality. Similarly, *malakoi* literally means \"soft\" and is often interpreted elsewhere as referring to moral weakness or lack of self-control, rather than sexuality.\n*   **Sodom and Gomorrah (Ezekiel 16:49):** Later in the Bible, the prophet Ezekiel explicitly states the sin of Sodom: \"Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.\" Affirming interpreters argue the sin was inhospitality and threatened violence, not consensual relationships.\n\n### 3. Orientation vs. Behavior\nAnother significant distinction in modern theology is the difference between **orientation** (who one is attracted to) and **behavior** (what one does).\n\n*   Many conservative Christian denominations distinguish between having same-sex attraction (which they may or may not view as a result of a fallen world) and acting on it. They generally teach that celibacy is the calling for Christians with same-sex attraction.\n*   Affirming denominations generally believe that God blesses marriage and intimacy between two people, regardless of gender, provided the relationship is loving and committed.\n\n### 4. Denominational Differences\nDifferent Christian denominations have come to different conclusions on this issue:\n*   **Opposing:** The Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and many Evangelical and Protestant denominations (such as the Southern Baptist Convention) maintain the traditional view that homosexual acts are sinful.\n*   **Affirming:** denominations such as the United Church of Christ (UCC), the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), and the Presbyterian Church (USA) allow for the ordination of LGBTQ+ clergy and the blessing of same-sex marriages.\n\n### Summary\nThere is no single consensus on this question.\n*   If you read the Bible through a **literalist** or **traditional** lens, the answer is generally **yes**, homosexual behavior is considered a sin.\n*   If you read the Bible through a **historical-critical** or **progressive** lens, the answer is often **no**, the verses cited do not apply to loving, consensual same-sex relationships.",
