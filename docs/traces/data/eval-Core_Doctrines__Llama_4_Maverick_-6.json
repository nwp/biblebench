    "expected": "The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became human, lived a perfect life, died on the cross as a substitute for sinners, rose from the dead, and now offers salvation and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe in him. It proclaims that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, not earned by human effort, received through faith in Christ alone.",
    "output": "The gospel, also known as the evangel, is the heart of Christianity and the central message of the Christian faith. The term \"gospel\" comes from the Old English words \"god\" (good) and \"spel\" (news or message), and it translates the Greek word εὐαγγέλιον (euangelion), which means \"good news.\"\n\nThe gospel is the good news that God has acted in Jesus Christ to save humanity from sin, its consequences, and its power. It is a message of redemption, reconciliation, and restoration, rooted in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nAt its core, the gospel is about the good news that:\n\n1. **Humanity is in a state of rebellion against God**: The Bible teaches that humanity has sinned and fallen short of God's glory (Romans 3:23), resulting in separation from God and spiritual death.\n2. **God loves humanity and desires to save**: Despite humanity's rebellion, God loves humanity and desires to save and restore them to a right relationship with Himself (John 3:16; Romans 5:8).\n3. **Jesus Christ is the solution**: God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to live a perfect life, die a substitutionary death on the cross, and rise from the dead on the third day, thereby providing a way for humanity to be forgiven, justified, and reconciled to God (1 Corinthians 15:3-4; Romans 3:24-25).\n4. **Salvation is a gift**: The gospel declares that salvation is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ, and not earned through human works or merit (Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:28).\n5. **Repentance and faith are the responses**: The gospel calls people to repent of their sins and put their faith in Jesus Christ, trusting in His finished work on the cross and His resurrection from the dead (Mark 1:15; Acts 20:21).\n\nThe gospel is not just a message about Jesus; it is the message of Jesus Himself (Mark 1:14-15). It is the good news that Jesus preached, and it is the good news about Jesus that the apostles and the early Christian church proclaimed.\n\nThe gospel has several key components:\n\n* **Justification**: The gospel declares that through faith in Jesus Christ, sinners are justified, or declared righteous, before a holy God (Romans 3:24; 5:1).\n* **Redemption**: The gospel announces that Jesus Christ has redeemed humanity from the slavery of sin and its consequences (Galatians 3:13; 1 Corinthians 6:20).\n* **Reconciliation**: The gospel proclaims that through Jesus Christ, God has reconciled humanity to Himself, restoring a broken relationship (2 Corinthians 5:18-21; Romans 5:10).\n\nThe gospel has far-reaching implications for individuals, communities, and the world. It brings hope, forgiveness, and new life to those who receive it, and it challenges people to live a life of obedience, love, and service to others.\n\nIn summary, the gospel is the good news that God has acted in Jesus Christ to save humanity from sin and its consequences, offering forgiveness, justification, redemption, and reconciliation to all who put their faith in Him.",

          "rationale": "The response accurately presents the gospel: good news about God acting in Jesus Christ to save sinners, the need for repentance and faith, and salvation as a free gift by grace through faith (not by works). It correctly emphasizes core biblical themes: the problem of sin, God’s love, Christ’s life, death (substitutionary), and resurrection, justification, redemption, and reconciliation, and the appropriate human responses. It also notes that the gospel is the message Jesus proclaimed and the implications for obedience and transformed life, which aligns with historic Protestant and broader evangelical orthodoxy. Scripture references are well-chosen to ground the claims (e.g., Rom 3:23; John 3:16; 1 Cor 15:3–4; Eph 2:8–9; Rom 3:28; Mark 1:15; 2 Cor 5:18–21). The major nuance that could be strengthened is an explicit mention of the incarnation (the eternal Son becoming human) and related Trinitarian framing; otherwise, the account is doctrinally sound and well-grounded in Scripture. Minor gaps aside, the answer is largely complete and nuanced."

The response presents a standard orthodox summary of the gospel: humanity’s sin, God’s love, Jesus’ life, death (substitutionary atonement), and resurrection, justification by faith, salvation as a gift, and repentance and faith as the appropriate response. It aligns with historic Christian teaching on salvation, reconciliation, redemption, and the proclamation of the gospel by the apostles. It explicitly rejects works-based salvation (Pelagianism) by affirming faith as the means of justification. While the etymology of the word “gospel” and some minor phrasing could be clarified (e.g., the precise Old English formation and explicit Trinitarian language), these do not constitute doctrinal deviation. Overall, the content is orthodox with no implied heresy."
