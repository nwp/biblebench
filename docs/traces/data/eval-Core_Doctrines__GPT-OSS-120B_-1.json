    "expected": "The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is one person with two complete and distinct natures: fully God and fully human. These two natures are united without mixture, confusion, separation, or division. Jesus is not partly God and partly human, but wholly God and wholly human simultaneously.",
    "output": "**The Hypostatic Union – A Biblical and Theological Overview**\n\n---\n\n### 1. What the Term Means\n\n| Greek term | English rendering | Technical sense |\n|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **ὕπατος** (*hypatos*) | “under‑lying” | The “ground” or “basis” of a thing. |\n| **ὑπόστασις** (*hypostasis*) | “person” or “substance” | In Trinitarian language it designates a *person* (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) that is distinct from a *nature* (ἀπόστο = essence). |\n| **σύν (union)** | “together‑ness” | The joining of two realities. |\n\n**Hypostatic Union** therefore is the doctrine that **in the one *person* (ὑπόστασις) of the Son of God there are *two distinct natures* (γνώσεις) – divine and human – united without confusion, change, division or separation.** The word “hypostatic” points to *personhood*; “union” points to the *in‑between* reality that joins the two natures.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Biblical Foundations\n\n| Biblical Passage | What it Affirms | How it Relates to the Union |\n|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|\n| **John 1:1, 14** | “In the beginning was the Word…Word became flesh…” | The pre‑existent Logos (divine nature) **took on** a human nature. The same subject (the Word) is both *God* and *man*. |\n| **Colossians 2:9** | “For in Him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.” | The deity is *fully present* in the *bodily* Christ, not merely impressed on a human shell. |\n| **Philippians 2:6‑8** | Christ “though he was in the form of God…emptied himself, taking the form of a servant.” | The *divine* Christ *voluntarily assumes* a *human* nature, yet the divine “form” is not lost. |\n| **Hebrews 1:3** | The Son “is the exact representation of God’s being.” | The Son’s humanity does not diminish the divine nature; He *exactly* reflects God. |\n| **John 20:28** | “My Lord and my God.” | The risen Christ is worshiped as **God**, not merely a human prophet. |\n| **Matthew 1:23** & **Isaiah 7:14** | “Immanuel—God with us.” | The fulfillment of prophecy points to a deity *dwelling* in humanity. |\n| **1 Timothy 3:16** | “He was manifest in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit…”. | Emphasizes both *flesh* (human) and *Spirit* (divine) in the same person. |\n\nThese passages collectively show that:\n\n1. **Christ is *one* subject** (the Son/Word/Christ) throughout the New Testament.\n2. **He possesses both a divine nature** (eternal, uncreated, omniscient, omnipotent) **and a human nature** (born, grew, suffered, died).\n3. **Both natures are fully present** and operational in the one person.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Why the Doctrine Is Needed\n\n1. **Salvation depends on the *perfect* humanity and *perfect* deity of Christ.**  \n   - Only a **perfect human** could represent us and die *in our stead* (Hebrews 2:17).  \n   - Only a **perfect God** could offer a sacrifice of infinite value and conquer sin and death (1 Peter 3:18; Romans 5:18).  \n\n2. **Only a *single* person can be the *Mediators* of the covenant.**  \n   - “God is one” (Deut 6:4) demands a single mediatorial figure (1 Tim 2:5).  \n   - The *personhood* of Christ guarantees that the Father’s work is accomplished *in* Him, not by a created agent.\n\n3. **The integrity of biblical worship.**  \n   - The Lord’s Prayer, the Creed, and the New Testament liturgy address *Jesus* as **Lord** and **God**.  If He were merely a man, worship would be idolatry; if He were merely a deity appearing in a mask, genuine incarnation would be denied.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Historical Articulation\n\n| Era | Problem | Council / Confession | Formulation |\n|-----|---------|----------------------|-------------|\n| **2nd–3rd c.** | Over‑emphasis on Christ’s humanity (e.g., Adoptionism) | *No ecumenical council*— early creeds (Old Roman, Nicene) | Affirmed *Christ’s full deity*. |\n| **Early 4th c.** | Arianism (Christ as a created being) | **Athanasius**, **Council of Nicaea** (AD 325) | “*Begotten, not made*; of the same substance (*homoousios*) as the Father.” |\n| **Late 4th c.** | **Nestorianism** (two persons) vs **Monophysitism** (one nature) | **Council of Chalcedon** (AD 451) | *“One and the same Son, perfect in divinity and perfection in humanity, truly God and truly man, a single person (hypostasis) who exists in two natures ‘without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.’”* |\n| **Later creeds** | Clarify language further | **Lambeth (1888),** **Orthodox (1978)** | Retain Chalcedonian formula, emphasize *communicatio idiomatum* (communication of properties) – e.g., the incarnation permits *God‑attributes* to affect human experience (e.g., suffering). |\n\nThe **Chalcedonian Definition** (the keystone for most mainstream Christian traditions) is the classic statement of the hypostatic union. It is still quoted verbatim in the *Catechism of the Catholic Church* (para 464), the *Lutheran Book of Concord* (Article XI), and the *Reformed Westminster Confession* (II.8).\n\n---\n\n### 5. What the Union Is **Not**\n\n| Misunderstanding | Why it Misses the Mark |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| **“Mixed” nature** – “God‑human” as a third, hybrid nature | The two *natures* remain fully distinct; the *person* is not a new nature (cf. “without confusion” & “without change”). |\n| **“Divine indwelling of a human soul”** (Adoptionist view) | The divine nature is not a *guest* in a human; it is **co‑essential** with the human nature in the same subject. |\n| **“Christ is only God who pretended to be man”** (Docetism) | Scripture records *real* human experiences: hunger, fatigue, pain, death (e.g., Matthew 4:2; John 4:6; Mark 15:34; Hebrews 2:9‑10). |\n| **“Two separate persons stacked together”** (Nestorianism) | The New Testament consistently identifies **one** subject who speaks, acts, and is worshiped (e.g., “I am the way, the truth, and the life” – John 14:6). |\n\n---\n\n### 6. How the Union Works – A Concise Theological Schema\n\n| Aspect | Divine Nature (Logos) | Human Nature (Man) |\n|--------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| **Origin** | Eternal, uncreated, consubstantial with the Father | Born of the Virgin Mary, fully entered into time |\n| **Attributes** | Omniscience, omnipotence, eternality | Limited knowledge, physical frailty, mortality |\n| **Operation in the Person** | *Communicatio idiomatum*: divine power enables miracles (e.g., turning water to wine, raising the dead). | *Communicatio idiomatum*: human experiences enable genuine empathy (e.g., “We have been tempted in every way, just as He was” – Hebrews 4:15). |\n| **State in the Incarnation** | **Unaffected** in essence (never ceased to be God). | **Fully assumed** in flesh (subject to growth, temptation, death). |\n| **Result** | One *hypostasis* – the Son – who is simultaneously **God the Son** and **Jesus of Nazareth**. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Pastoral and Soteriological Implications\n\n1. **Assurance of a Full Atonement** – Because Christ *truly* bore our sin *as a man* and *truly* offered a sacrifice *as God*, the atonement is both *satisfying* (God’s justice) and *representative* (our humanity).  \n2. **God’s Empathy** – Hebrews 4:15: “We do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses…” – God can *truly* sympathize because He **has truly become** human.  \n3. **Christ as the Model of the Christian Life** – Philippians 2:5‑8 presents the *humiliation* of the divine nature as the pattern for believers: *emptying* ourselves in service (while still retaining our identity as persons).  \n4. **Worship and Prayer** – Since Christ is *both* God and man, we can address Him as **Lord** (a title reserved for deity) while also recognizing Him as **our fellow‑worker** in humanity (e.g., “Lord, have mercy upon us” – Matthew 5:42).  \n5. **Eschatological Hope** – The resurrected, glorified body of Christ (John 20:27; 1 Cor 15) shows the destiny awaiting believers: a **bodily** vindication of the human nature, now fully united with the divine.\n\n---\n\n### 8. A Concise Definition for Use\n\n> **The hypostatic union is the mystery that in the one person (hypostasis) of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, there exist two complete, unmingled natures—one divine, one human—joined inseparably. This union is essential for Christ to be the true Mediator of salvation, the object of worship, and the embodiment of God's solidarity with humanity.**  \n\n---\n\n### 9. Suggested Further Reading (Classical & Contemporary)\n\n| Source | Why It Helps |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Athanasius, *On the Incarnation*** | Early articulation of the need for true humanity and divinity. |\n| **Council of Chalcedon, *Definition* (AD 451)** | The classic formulation of the hypostatic union. |\n| **Luther, *The Bondage of the Will* (1525)** – Chapter on Christ’s nature | Reformation perspective on the union. |\n| **John Calvin, *Institutes* (III.12‑13)** | Protestant systematic articulation. |\n| **Beverly Roberts Gaventa, *Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study* (2021)** | Modern scholarly synthesis, biblically grounded. |\n\n---\n\n**In sum**, the hypostatic union is the biblical, historic, and logical answer to the question: *How can Christ be truly God and truly man?* Scripture testifies to a single Son who is both the eternal Logos and the incarnate Jesus; the Church, in defining the doctrine at Chalcedon, preserved the paradox while forbidding absurd extremes. This doctrine safeguards the core of the gospel—Christ’s work of redemption, His empathy for us, and His rightful place as the object of Christian worship.",

            "Section 1 contains Greek-terminology mistakes: ὕπατος (hypatos) is not the standard rendering for 'under‑lying'; the technical term for 'hypostasis' is ὑπόστασις. The table also uses γνώσεις (which means 'knowledge' or not 'natures') where the proper term for 'nature' is φύσις or οὐσία. This mislabeling could confuse readers about the core terms (hypostasis, phy­sis/ousia) that define the doctrine.",
            "There is a minor imprecision on kenosis: Philippians 2:6–8 is described as the divine form not being lost. Classical and contemporary orthodox readings typically emphasize that the divine essence remains intact in the incarnation, and that the Son empties himself in the sense of humbling himself, not in a way that entails losing divine attributes. The wording could be clearer to avoid implying a loss of divine nature.",
            "Some nuance around the communicatio idiomatum could be stated more precisely: the one hypostasis (the person) possesses both natures and the properties of both natures can be ascribed to the single person. The explanation is broadly correct, but the standard formulation stresses the unity of the person (hypostasis) and the proper attribution of properties to the person rather than a simple causal-linguistic transfer of miracles from divinity to humanity."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the response faithfully articulates the hypostatic union in line with historic orthodox Christology: one Person (hypostasis) with two complete natures (divine and human) united without confusion, change, division, or separation; strong biblical grounding and alignment with Chalcedonian language. However, factual slips in the Greek terminology (mislabeling of hypostasis terminology and nature terms) and a somewhat imprecise treatment of kenosis and communicatio idiomatum reduce the precision slightly. The core doctrine, its biblical basis, and its historical articulation remain sound, and the pastoral implications are appropriate."

Specifically, correct the Greek vocabulary (use ὑπόστασις for 'person', φύσις/οὐσία for 'nature/essence'), fix the Greek terms in the first table, and ensure Hebrews 4:15 is quoted with the accurate nuance.
