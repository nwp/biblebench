    "expected": "Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both biblical truths held in tension. God is completely sovereign over all things, yet humans are genuine moral agents responsible for their choices. Scripture teaches both that God ordains all things and that humans make real choices for which they are accountable. Different theological traditions emphasize these aspects differently (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), but orthodox Christianity affirms both truths without fully resolving the mystery of how they relate.",
    "output": "# Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility\n\n## The Paradox\n\nThe relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility represents one of theology's most profound tensions. Scripture clearly affirms both truths without resolving the apparent contradiction in ways that fully satisfy human logic.\n\n## Divine Sovereignty\n\n**Biblical Teaching:**\n- God is absolutely sovereign over all creation (Psalm 115:3, Isaiah 46:9-10)\n- He ordains whatsoever comes to pass (Ephesians 1:11)\n- He works all things according to His will (Daniel 4:35)\n- Nothing occurs outside His sovereign decree, including human decisions (Proverbs 16:9, 21:1)\n\n## Human Responsibility\n\n**Biblical Teaching:**\n- Humans make real choices and are held accountable (Deuteronomy 30:19)\n- We are commanded to repent, believe, and obey (Acts 17:30, John 3:16-18)\n- Judgment is based on human decisions and actions (Romans 2:6-8, Revelation 20:12)\n- Scripture never treats human agency as illusory (Ezekiel 18:20)\n\n## The Biblical Tension\n\nScripture presents both truths simultaneously:\n- **Joseph's brothers**: \"You meant evil...but God meant it for good\" (Genesis 50:20)\n- **Crucifixion**: Acted by human wickedness yet according to God's predetermined plan (Acts 2:23, 4:27-28)\n- **Salvation**: God's sovereign election and human responsibility to believe (John 6:37, 44; Acts 16:31)\n\n## Theological Framework\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n1. **Different Levels of Causation**: God's sovereign decree operates on a different plane than human volition; He ordains both the end and the means, including genuine human choice.\n\n2. **Compatibilism**: Human choices are free and real (not coerced) while also being certain within God's sovereign plan.\n\n3. **Mystery, Not Contradiction**: Our finite minds cannot fully comprehend how both operate together, but Scripture's affirmation of both demands we hold them in tension.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\n- **Prayer**: We pray fervently because God ordains means (prayer) as well as ends\n- **Evangelism**: We share the gospel urgently, knowing God uses human proclamation\n- **Sanctification**: We work out our salvation while God works in us (Philippians 2:12-13)\n- **Comfort**: God's sovereignty provides assurance; our responsibility prevents presumption\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe must resist reducing either truth to preserve systematic neatness. The Bible calls us to affirm both divine sovereignty and human responsibility, trusting God's wisdom where our understanding fails.",

          "explanation": "The response articulates a biblically grounded, traditionally orthodox view of divine sovereignty and human responsibility (often labeled compatibilism). It affirms core Christian doctrines: God's sovereign rule over creation, human accountability and moral agency, and the biblical tension between God’s decretive will and human choices. It rejects unorthodox positions implicitly (e.g., denies Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism). The material cites compatible Scripture (e.g., Genesis 50:20; Acts 2:23; John 6:37, 44; Philippians 2:12-13) and aligns with historic Christian emphasis on both divine providence and human response. Potential caveats to watch for in pastoral or scholarly usage: (1) The formula that “nothing occurs outside God’s sovereign decree” can be read as hard determinism unless clarified to distinguish God’s sovereign ordaining of both ends and means from human real, accountable choice; (2) the language of “levels of causation” and “mystery” should be handled carefully to maintain clear responsibility and avoid inadvertent fatalism. Overall, no heretical teaching is present; the work reflects a sound orthodox framework with advisable cautions for nuance.)"
