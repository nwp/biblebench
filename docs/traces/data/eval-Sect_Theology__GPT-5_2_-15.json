    "expected": "Christians should respond with both truth and love (Ephesians 4:15). This means: (1) Treating individuals with genuine respect, kindness, and dignity as fellow image-bearers of God; (2) Being honest about theological differences without compromise or deception; (3) Recognizing sincere faith and devotion while acknowledging doctrinal error; (4) Avoiding hostility, mockery, or personal attacks; (5) Being willing to build relationships and have respectful conversations; (6) Praying for those in theological error while maintaining clarity about orthodox teaching. Jesus was both gracious to individuals (John 4, woman at the well) and clear about truth (John 8:24, 'you will die in your sins'). We can firmly defend orthodox doctrine while loving our neighbors, including those in non-orthodox groups.",
    "output": "Christians should respond to Latter-day Saints (LDS/Mormons) and Jehovah’s Witnesses (JWs) with respect, honesty, and love—not hostility—while also being clear about where orthodox Christianity agrees and disagrees with their teachings. That combination (charity + truth) is the consistent pattern in historic Christian doctrine and practice.\n\n## 1) What “orthodox Christian theology” expects in our posture toward others\nAcross major historic traditions (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant), Christian ethics strongly rejects hostility as a default posture toward religious outsiders.\n\n### Key biblical and doctrinal themes\n- **Every person bears God’s image** (Genesis 1:26–27): therefore every person merits dignity and respectful treatment, regardless of beliefs.\n- **Love of neighbor and even enemies** (Matthew 5:44; Mark 12:31): hostility contradicts Christ’s command.\n- **Gentleness in witness** (1 Peter 3:15–16): Christians are told to give reasons for their hope “with gentleness and respect.”\n- **Avoid quarrelsome spirit** (2 Timothy 2:24–25): the Lord’s servant should not be quarrelsome but kind and patient, aiming at repentance and truth.\n- **Truthfulness and clarity** (Ephesians 4:15): “speaking the truth in love” is the classic summary.\n\nSo, orthodox Christianity calls for **respectful engagement**, not insult, mockery, coercion, or contempt. Firm disagreement is compatible with respect; hostility is not.\n\n## 2) Why these groups raise doctrinal questions for orthodox Christians\nLDS and JW communities often use Christian language (Jesus, salvation, scripture), but **orthodox Christianity typically classifies both as outside “historic Christian orthodoxy”** because of major departures from core doctrines defined by the early church and ecumenical creeds (e.g., Nicene Christianity).\n\n### Areas of major doctrinal divergence (brief and fair)\n**Jehovah’s Witnesses**\n- **God/Trinity:** JWs reject the Trinity and teach that Jesus is a created being (often identified with Michael the archangel), not fully God in the Nicene sense.\n- **Christology:** Orthodox Christianity teaches Jesus is eternally God the Son, incarnate; JWs teach a different ontological status for Christ.\n- **Authority:** JWs place strong interpretive authority in the Watch Tower Society; this differs from how most orthodox traditions understand ecclesial authority and interpretation.\n\n**Latter-day Saints (LDS)**\n- **God/Trinity:** LDS theology rejects classical Trinitarianism and teaches a fundamentally different view of God (often described in terms of distinct divine beings, with God the Father having an embodied form; there are intra-LDS nuances, but it remains non-Nicene).\n- **Revelation/Scripture:** LDS accepts additional scriptures (Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price) and ongoing prophetic revelation, diverging from the mainstream Christian view of the biblical canon as normative and closed.\n- **Doctrine of exaltation:** Traditional LDS teachings about exaltation/theosis are framed differently than classic Christian theosis, and are often seen by orthodox Christians as a significant departure in doctrine of God and humanity.\n\nNone of that implies moral inferiority of LDS or JW individuals; it means **their systems of doctrine are not the same as Nicene, creedally orthodox Christianity**.\n\n## 3) Agreement and common ground (often overlooked)\nOrthodox Christians can acknowledge real overlaps:\n- **Reverence for Jesus** (even if defined differently)\n- **Strong moral seriousness** in many communities\n- **Commitment to evangelism and community life**\n- **Value placed on Scripture** (though interpreted differently)\n\nRecognizing common ground is not “compromise”; it’s basic fairness and can make conversation more honest.\n\n## 4) What “respect” looks like in practice (without pretending differences don’t matter)\nA Christian response shaped by orthodox theology typically includes:\n\n### A) Treat them as neighbors, not projects or threats\n- Build real relationships.\n- Avoid caricatures; listen to what the person actually believes.\n- Distinguish between **official teachings** and what a specific individual understands.\n\n### B) Be candid about disagreements—especially on the identity of God and Christ\nOrthodox Christians see the **Trinity and the deity of Christ** as central, not optional. Respect doesn’t require “agreeing to disagree” on essentials; it requires discussing them without contempt.\n\n### C) Use accurate sources and fair comparisons\n- Don’t rely on rumors or hostile websites.\n- When critiquing, cite primary texts (Watchtower publications; LDS scriptures/official statements) and compare them to historic creeds and Scripture.\n\n### D) Avoid spiritual pride and “gotcha” tactics\nOrthodox Christianity condemns arrogance and calls believers to humility (James 4:6). Argument that humiliates the other person is usually counterproductive and ethically suspect.\n\n### E) Maintain Christian boundaries\nRespect also means refusing manipulation or pressure. If conversations become coercive, deceptive, or toxic, it is legitimate to disengage politely.\n\n## 5) Is any “hardness” ever appropriate?\nThere is a place for **strong warning** in Christian tradition—especially for shepherds guarding their flocks from teachings they believe to be spiritually harmful (Acts 20:28–31). But even then, orthodox ethics insists on:\n- No dehumanization\n- No slander\n- No hatred\n- No mocking\n- No violence or harassment\n\nA pastor may strongly caution against a theology; that is different from encouraging hostility toward people.\n\n## 6) A balanced, orthodox Christian summary\n- **Hostility** toward LDS or JWs conflicts with Christian love, the imago Dei, and the commanded posture of gentleness.\n- **Respectful engagement** is required, paired with **clear theological honesty** about real doctrinal differences—especially regarding God, Christ, and authority.\n- The goal is not “winning,” but bearing faithful witness to Christ while treating the other person as someone Christ calls us to love.\n\nIf you tell me your context (family member involved, doorstep visits, online debate, church policy question), I can suggest a more tailored approach and what topics are most fruitful—or least fruitful—to discuss.",

It correctly notes major orthodox topics where LDS/JW diverge from Nicene Christianity (the Trinity/Deity of Christ for JWs; additional scriptures and divergent soteriology for LDS) without dehumanizing adherents. It emphasizes fair comparison, caution against hostility, and appropriate boundaries in conversation, consistent with the example of Jesus’ grace and truth (John 4; John 8:24). Nuanced points are appropriately acknowledged (overlaps with believers, the place of strong warnings, historical patterns of witness), though some specifics of each group’s theology are summarized rather than exhaustively detailing their doctrines. Overall, a faithful, biblically grounded, and historically informed evaluation.)"
