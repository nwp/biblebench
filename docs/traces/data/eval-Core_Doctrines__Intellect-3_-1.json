    "expected": "The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is one person with two complete and distinct natures: fully God and fully human. These two natures are united without mixture, confusion, separation, or division. Jesus is not partly God and partly human, but wholly God and wholly human simultaneously.",
    "output": "The **hypostatic union** is the foundational doctrine in Christian theology concerning the person of Jesus Christ. It defines the unique and inseparable union of Christ's divine nature and human nature in one divine person. Here's a clear, biblically grounded explanation:\n\n1.  **The Core Definition:**\n    *   In Jesus Christ, there are **two distinct, complete, and unconfused natures**: **one divine** (the nature of God - eternal, infinite, omnipotent, omniscient, immutable) and **one human** (the nature of a real human being - finite, temporal, capable of suffering, experiencing growth, temptation).\n    *   These two natures are **united** in the **one divine person** of the Son of God (the Second Person of the Trinity).\n    *   This union is **personal, eternal, and inseparable**. It is not a temporary arrangement or a moral example, but a permanent state of being for the incarnate Christ.\n\n2.  **The Key Formula:**\n    *   The classic definition, established at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) and affirmed by major Christian traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant), is:\n        > **\"One person in two natures\"** (Greek: *mia physis (or hypostasis) en dyo physei* - though the precise Greek phrasing can vary slightly).\n    *   **Hypostasis (Person):** Refers to the distinct, subsistent reality of a rational being. In the Trinity, there are three divine hypostases (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). In Christ, there is only *one* divine hypostasis (the Son), who now possesses two natures.\n    *   **Physis (Nature):** Refers to the essential qualities or attributes that make a being what it is. Christ has two: divine and human.\n\n3.  **Biblical Foundation:**\n    *   **Divine Nature:** Jesus is identified as God:\n        *   John 1:1, 14: \"In the beginning was the Word... and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh...\"\n        *   John 20:28: Thomas worships Jesus, saying, \"My Lord and my God!\"\n        *   Colossians 2:9: \"For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.\"\n        *   Titus 2:13: \"Our great God and Savior Jesus Christ...\"\n        *   Hebrews 1:8: \"But of the Son he says, 'Your throne, O God, forever and ever...'\"\n        *   Attributes like omnipresence (Matt. 28:20), omniscience (John 1:48), omnipotence (Matt. 28:18), and the power to forgive sins (Mark 2:5-7) are ascribed to him.\n    *   **Human Nature:** Jesus is clearly a real human being:\n        *   He was born (Luke 2:10-11), grew (Luke 2:52), became tired (John 4:6), thirsty (John 19:28), experienced sorrow (Matt. 26:37), felt pain (Isa. 53:3-5, Heb. 4:15), died (Matt. 27:50), and was buried (Matt. 27:59-60).\n        *   He prayed (Luke 3:21, 6:12), increasing in wisdom (Luke 2:52), and was subject to temptation (Matt. 4:1-11, Heb. 4:15).\n    *   **The Union:** The Bible presents Jesus as both God *and* man simultaneously:\n        *   John 1:14: \"The Word became flesh...\" (Divine Word taking on human nature).\n        *   Romans 1:3-4: \"...concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness...\"\n        *   Galatians 4:4: \"But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman...\"\n        *   Philippians 2:5-7: \"...who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.\"\n        *   1 Timothy 2:5: \"For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.\" (This highlights his distinct role as mediator, requiring both natures).\n        *   Hebrews 2:14, 17: \"...the children have shared in flesh and blood... Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect... for because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.\" (His humanity is essential for his saving work).\n\n4.  **What the Hypostatic Union Is NOT:**\n    *   **Not a Mixture (Eutychianism):** The two natures are not blended into a third, new, hybrid nature. They remain distinct.\n    *   **Not a Separation (Nestorianism):** The two natures are not separated into two distinct persons. There is only one \"I AM\" in Christ.\n    *   **Not a Mere Indwelling:** God did not merely inhabit a human person like a temple (as in some ancient heresies). The divine Son *is* the man Jesus.\n    *   **Not a Temporary State:** The union began at the incarnation (conception by the Holy Spirit - Luke 1:35) and is permanent. Christ remains fully God and fully man, even now in his glorified state.\n\n5.  **The Communication of Properties (Communicatio Idiomatum):**\n    *   Because there is only one person, attributes and experiences of both natures can be predicated *of the one person*.\n    *   Examples:\n        *   **Divine Attributes Predicated of the Person:** We can say \"Jesus is omnipotent\" (Matt. 28:18).\n        *   **Human Experiences Predicated of the Person:** We can say \"Jesus suffered\" (Heb. 2:9, 10).\n        *   **Human Limitations Predicated of the Person:** We can say \"Jesus grew in wisdom\" (Luke 2:52).\n        *   **Divine Actions Predicated of the Person:** We can say \"Jesus created the world\" (John 1:3, Col. 1:16 - understood as the divine Son acting through the incarnate person).\n    *   This does *not* mean the divine nature *suffered* or the human nature was *omnipotent*. It means the *one person* possesses and acts through both natures. The properties belong to the natures, but are predicated of the person.\n\n6.  **Why It Matters (Significance):**\n    *   **Revelation:** Jesus is the perfect revelation of God (Heb. 1:3, John 1:18).\n    *   **Salvation:** Only God can provide an adequate sacrifice for sin (infinite value) and only a real human can represent humanity in death and communicate divine life. Christ's two natures are essential for his saving work as mediator (1 Tim. 2:5), substitute (Rom. 3:25-26), and high priest (Heb. 2:17-18, 4:14-15).\n    *   **Worship:** We worship Jesus as God.\n    *   **Christian Life:** We relate to Jesus as both our God and our brother (Heb. 2:11-18).\n    *   **Foundation of Doctrine:** It underpins key doctrines like the Incarnation, Atonement, Resurrection, and Intercession.\n\n**In Summary:** The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity, is one divine person who possesses, in perfect unity and without confusion or change, two distinct natures: a fully divine nature and a fully human nature. This union is not a mixture or a temporary state, but the permanent, personal, and inseparable reality of the incarnate Son. It is grounded in Scripture and affirmed as essential Christian orthodoxy. It means that Jesus is truly God and truly man, the one Mediator between God and humanity.",

            "The Greek formula quoted for the Chalcedonian phrase is imprecise. The standard formulation is along the lines of: ‘one person (hypostasis) in two natures (physis)’—often stated as ‘mia hypostasis en dyo physeis’. The response writes “mia physis (or hypostasis) en dyo physei,” which could be confusing or misleading about the exact Greek wording.",
            "A potential nuance issue: while the section on communicatio idiomatum is generally solid, the example “Jesus created the world” as a predication of the one person should be carefully framed as referring to the pre-incarnate Son acting through the incarnate person, rather than attributing humanly mediated acts to a single nature in isolation. This is a subtle point and requires careful theological precision to avoid implying that the human nature itself possesses omnipotence or that the incarnation changes the nature of creation."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the answer accurately articulates the core doctrine of the hypostatic union (one person in two complete, unconfused natures; divine and human; indivisible and permanent). It aligns with historic orthodoxy (Chalcedonian standard), grounds claims in key biblical passages, and highlights important nuances (communication of properties, not mixing/separation). The minor Greek-phrase imprecision and the need for careful caveats around communicatio idiomatum examples represent small gaps, not fundamental errors. The scoring reflects strong doctrinal and biblical conformity with only minor clarifications needed."

          "explanation": "The response presents a thorough, orthodox account of the hypostatic union as defined by Chalcedon: one person (the Son) with two natures (divine and human) united without confusion, change, division, or separation. It correctly affirms the divine identity of Jesus, the real humanity, and the union’s permanent, personal nature. It also accurately explains the communicatio idiomatum and the significance for revelation, atonement, worship, and mediation. Minor clarifications or nuances could be added to enhance precision: \n- The Chalcedonian formula is best stated as: one hypostasis in two natures (μία ὑπόστασις ἐν δύο φύσεσιν); some Oriental Orthodox Christians hold Miaphysitism and do not accept Chalcedon, which is a relevant historical nuance. \n- The Greek phrasing in the text is slightly off; the precise form is ‘μία ὑπόστασις ἐν δύο φύσεσιν’ rather than mixing ‘mia physis’ with ‘en dyo physei.’ \n- The claim that the divine Son created the world is standard language for the Logos but could be clarified to emphasize the Logos acting through the incarnate person, avoiding confusing attribution of creation to a separate “human” agent. \nOverall, there are no heretical errors in substance."
