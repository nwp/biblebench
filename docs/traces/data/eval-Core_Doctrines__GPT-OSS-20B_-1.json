    "expected": "The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is one person with two complete and distinct natures: fully God and fully human. These two natures are united without mixture, confusion, separation, or division. Jesus is not partly God and partly human, but wholly God and wholly human simultaneously.",
    "output": "**Hypostatic Union – A Systematic Theological Overview**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Definition\nThe **hypostatic union** is the orthodox Christian teaching that in the person of Jesus Christ there are two complete, distinct natures—divine and human—united in one single *substance* (*hypostasis*).  \n- **Divine nature**: The eternal, uncreated, omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly holy nature of the Father as revealed in the Son.  \n- **Human nature**: The finite, created, embodied, amenable, and fallible nature of the Son, as an *only‑begotten* Son of the living God, born of the Virgin Mary.  \n\nThe union is *unmediated* and *unmixed*; the divinity remains unchanged in the human body, and the humanity remains authentic and complete in the divine person.\n\nThe terminology comes from the Cappadocian Councils (especially the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD), which adopted the Greek word **ὑποστασία** (*hypostasis*) to describe the Persons of the Trinity and thus applied it analogously to the single person of Christ.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Biblical Foundations  \n(For conciseness, I list key graphic passages; a full exegetical study would include each one.)\n\n| Scriptural Evidence | What It Highlights |\n|---------------------|-------------------|\n| **John 1:1‑14** | “In the beginning was the Word, … and the Word became flesh” – the Word (the divine Logos) both remains divine and takes on a complete human condition. |\n| **Colossians 2:9** | “In Christ the whole fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily.” |\n| **Philippians 2:5‑8** | “Christ, being in the form of God, did not consider equality with God a thing to be used for His own advantage. He humbled Himself, dependent on the human will.” |\n| **Hebrews 1:3** | “The Son…subsides the shining Head of God’s glory.” – Recognition of divine status even while human. |\n| **Hebrews 2:14‑18** | Christ shares human *tentative* suffering; He fully obtains the “third place” (the human position). |\n| **Hebrews 4:14** | “Our High Priest, Jesus the Son of God” – highlights both divine priesthood and human experience. |\n| **1 Timothy 3:16** | “Great… was the Lord…” – the divine quality of Christ, while his death itself is lethal, “in the flesh.” |\n| **Revelation 1:4, 2:23** | Christ is both \"the First and the Last, the living one that was dead, and I hold Him by His finger\" – dual nature simultaneously. |\n| **Luke 2:7** | “Born of a woman” – the necessary human condition. |\n| **Romans 8:3‑5** | Creation by the *Word* gives knowledge to the *Son* (“…who is in the likeness of God, and whose heart yearning” – a human heart in a divine spirit). |\n\nNotably, the key is *co‑occurrence*: the Scriptures speak of Christ as *God* and as *man* without dividing or ignoring either side.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Historical Development  \n\n| Period | Key Development | Representative Figures |\n|--------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| **Early Church (2nd–4th century)** | **Johannine Thought** – *Logos* theology (early *Logion*, *Johannine* hypotheses). | **Origen**, **Irenaeus** |\n| **3rd‑4th century** | **Arian Controversy**: challenge to the full divinity of Christ (Given in Council of Nicaea). | **Aurelius Augustinus**, *Arius*, ***Aurelius**. |\n| **4th century** | **Council of Nicaea (325 AD)** – Christ as *consubstantial* with the Father: *homoousios*. | **Athanasius**, **Justus** |\n| **5th century** | **Council of Chalcedon (451 AD)** – The formulation of the hypostatic union: “One Person (`hypostasis`) in Two Natures (‘bi-ous’) (divine and human).” | **Papias**, **Laurentius**, **St. John Chrysostom** (anterior). |\n| **Subsequent** | The doctrine was refined:  \n  * Distinction of the *two wills* (divine vs. human).  \n  * Rejection of *Nestorianism* (two persons) and *Monophysitism* (one nature). | **Jerome**, **Eusebius**, **Gregory the Great** |\n\n*Chalcedon* established the contemporary vocabulary of \"hypostasis\" and \"nature\" still used by orthodox theologians today.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Theological Significance  \n\n1. **Christ’s Divine Authority** – Only a divine being can decree salvation; divine nature the *cause* of redemption.  \n2. **Christ’s Human Identity** – Only a full human can truly die, suffer, and be a representative (co‑suffering) of humanity; the human nature the *means* of redemption.  \n3. **Incarnational Economy** – The hypostatic union is the only possible vehicle whereby divine grace can be “realized” without loss of human liberty or integrity.  \n4. **Central to Soteriology**  \n   – **Grace** (imputed).  \n   – **Atonement**: A perfectly holy man is worthy of atoning for humanity’s sin while a fully divine being possesses the power for removal.  \n5. **Christ as Mediator** – Based on 1Tim. 3:16 and Paul’s *Meditative* hypothesis, we have a mediator who is the *exact same* person of God and man: no status or identity is lost.  \n6. **Christ’s Humanity** is essential for *vicarious* pastoral care: He can truly empathize with sorrow, hunger, fear, etc.  \n\nUnlike the *unio fidei* (union of faith) proposed by some modern movements or the *absolute humanity* claim by others, the hypostatic union embodies *both* natures simultaneously in a single person.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Common Misunderstandings & Heresies  \n\n| Misunderstanding | Why It Misleads |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Docetism (Christ only appeared mortal)** | Rejects Scripture’s explicit affirmations that Jesus suffered true physical pain (e.g., *He was with God*). |\n| **Arianism (“Son” created from Father)** | Undermines Christ’s divine essence (John 1:1), which is needed to make his death possible. |\n| **Monophysitism (only divine nature, human mixed in)** | Misstates the complete humanity (Heb. 4:15 – He *became** a man). |\n| **Nestorianism (two separate persons)** | Confuses the *one* Person (hypostasis) with the *two* natures that exist in the same person; this would remove the crucial mediation mission. |\n| **Mormon “Son of God” theology** | Distinguishes God the Father from the Son, with the latter as a created being, violating the immutability principles of the divine nature. |\n\n---\n\n### 6. Summary\n\n- **Hypostatic Union**: In Jesus Christ, the *divine* and *human* remain distinct but are united *without confusion, alteration, or separation* in the one *hypostasis* of Christ.  \n- **Scripture**: Across the NT, Jesus is declared both *God* (Col. 2:9, Heb. 1:3) and *man* (Luke 2:7, Heb. 2:14).  \n- **Orthodox Definition** (Chalcedon): “One *Person*, with two *natures* (divine and human), each complete and unchanged.”  \n- **Theological import**: This union enables Christ’s perfect intercession, both a sacrifice that satisfies divine holiness and a life that truly offers redemption for a fallen human species.  \n\nHence, the hypostatic union is foundational not only to Christology but to the entire biblical narrative of redemption, making it the central theological crown of Christian faith.",

These errors significantly affect biblical grounding and overall doctrinal soundness, even though the main doctrinal framework is accurately stated.
