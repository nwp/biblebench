It accurately affirms orthodox Christology: Jesus is truly God and truly human, the Incarnation is real (not a divine illusion), and the hypostatic union (one person in two natures) is the standard. The response supports this with biblical references traditionally cited against Docetism (John 1:14; Luke 24:39; Hebrews 2:14; 2:17; 9:22; 1 John 4:2-3; 2 John 7) and notes the early creedal affirmations (Chalcedon). It also notes the doctrinal consequences for salvation and atonement if Jesus were not truly human. Nuance is present in its explanation of why denial undercuts the gospel and in acknowledging the historical development of orthodoxy. A minor enhancement could be a clearer emphasis on the term “hypostatic union” as the precise technical label, but the core content is accurate and well-grounded."
