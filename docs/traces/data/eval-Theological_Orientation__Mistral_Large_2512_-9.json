    "expected": "",
    "output": "The Bible’s teaching on sex before marriage is clear in its moral framework, though Christians have interpreted and applied these teachings in various ways across history and denominational traditions. Below is a thoughtful, biblically grounded exploration of the topic, engaging with key texts, theological principles, and differing Christian perspectives.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Biblical Foundations on Sexuality and Marriage**\nThe Bible presents sexuality as a good gift from God (Genesis 1:28, 2:24–25) but one that is to be expressed within the covenant of marriage between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6; Ephesians 5:31). Several key themes emerge:\n\n#### **A. Sex as a Unitive and Procreative Gift**\n- **Genesis 2:24–25**: The first marriage is described as a \"one-flesh\" union, where husband and wife become \"naked and unashamed.\" This suggests that sexual intimacy is designed to be a profound, exclusive bond within marriage.\n- **1 Corinthians 7:2–5**: Paul teaches that sexual relations are a marital right and duty, emphasizing mutual consent and the avoidance of sexual immorality (*porneia*—see below). Sex is not just for procreation but also for mutual pleasure and unity.\n- **Song of Solomon**: This poetic book celebrates erotic love within marriage, affirming the goodness of sexual desire when rightly ordered.\n\n#### **B. Prohibitions Against Sexual Immorality (*Porneia*)**\nThe New Testament consistently condemns *porneia* (Greek: πορνεία), a broad term encompassing all forms of sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage. Key passages include:\n- **1 Corinthians 6:12–20**: Paul warns that sexual immorality is a sin against one’s own body, which is a \"temple of the Holy Spirit.\" He urges believers to \"flee from sexual immorality\" (v. 18).\n- **1 Thessalonians 4:3–5**: \"For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God.\"\n- **Hebrews 13:4**: \"Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.\"\n- **Acts 15:20, 29**: The Jerusalem Council instructs Gentile believers to abstain from *porneia*, listing it alongside idolatry and bloodshed as practices incompatible with Christian faith.\n\n#### **C. The Call to Holiness and Self-Control**\n- **Galatians 5:19–21**: Sexual immorality is listed among the \"works of the flesh\" that exclude people from the kingdom of God.\n- **1 Peter 1:14–16**: Believers are called to be holy, as God is holy, which includes sexual purity.\n- **2 Timothy 2:22**: \"Flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace.\"\n\n#### **D. Old Testament Precedents**\n- **Exodus 20:14 (7th Commandment)**: \"You shall not commit adultery\" assumes the sanctity of marriage and condemns extramarital sex.\n- **Leviticus 18, 20**: These chapters list prohibited sexual relationships (incest, adultery, homosexuality, bestiality) under the broader principle of holiness (Lev. 18:24–30).\n- **Proverbs 5–7**: Warns against the dangers of sexual sin, particularly adultery, but the principles apply broadly to all forms of sexual immorality.\n\n---\n\n### **2. What Counts as \"Sex Before Marriage\"?**\nThe Bible does not provide a technical definition of \"sex,\" but it consistently condemns *porneia*, which includes:\n- **Fornication**: Sexual intercourse between unmarried partners.\n- **Adultery**: Sex with someone other than one’s spouse.\n- **Lustful thoughts**: Jesus equates lust with adultery in the heart (Matthew 5:27–28).\n- **Other sexual acts**: While the Bible does not list every possible act, the principle of \"one-flesh\" union (Genesis 2:24) suggests that any sexual activity intended to mimic or replace marital intimacy is included in *porneia*.\n\n**Cohabitation (Living Together Before Marriage):**\nThe Bible does not explicitly address cohabitation, but several principles apply:\n- **Appearance of Evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22)**: Cohabitation can create the appearance of sexual immorality, even if the couple is abstinent.\n- **Temptation (1 Corinthians 10:12–13)**: Living together without the commitment of marriage can lead to sexual sin, as it removes the safeguards of accountability and public vows.\n- **Witness to the World (Matthew 5:16)**: Cohabitation can undermine the Christian witness, as it may be perceived as endorsing premarital sex.\n- **Marriage as a Covenant (Malachi 2:14)**: Marriage is a public, covenantal commitment before God and the community. Cohabitation lacks this formal, sacred dimension.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Different Christian Perspectives**\nWhile the biblical witness is clear in its condemnation of *porneia*, Christians have differed in how they apply these teachings:\n\n#### **A. Traditional View (Historical Christian Consensus)**\n- **Position**: Sex is reserved for heterosexual marriage. Premarital sex, cohabitation, and other forms of *porneia* are sinful.\n- **Biblical Support**: Passages like 1 Corinthians 6:18–20, Hebrews 13:4, and 1 Thessalonians 4:3–5 are taken at face value.\n- **Theological Rationale**: Sex is a sacred act that reflects the covenant between Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5:31–32). Premarital sex distorts this symbolism.\n- **Practical Application**: Couples are encouraged to abstain until marriage, avoid cohabitation, and seek accountability.\n\n#### **B. Progressive/Revisionist View**\n- **Position**: Some argue that the Bible’s sexual ethics are culturally conditioned and that modern understandings of love, consent, and commitment should inform Christian practice. Premarital sex may be permissible if the relationship is loving, committed, and monogamous.\n- **Biblical Support**: Appeals to the Bible’s silence on cohabitation, the cultural context of *porneia* (e.g., temple prostitution, exploitation), and Jesus’ emphasis on love (Matthew 22:37–39).\n- **Theological Rationale**: God’s grace and love are prioritized over legalistic rules. Some argue that lifelong celibacy is unrealistic for most people, and that sex can be a good gift in committed relationships.\n- **Practical Application**: Premarital sex and cohabitation may be acceptable if the couple is in a serious, loving relationship.\n\n#### **C. Middle-Ground Views**\n- **Betrothal View**: Some argue that in biblical times, betrothal (engagement) was a legally binding commitment, and sex during betrothal was not considered *porneia* (e.g., Mary and Joseph in Matthew 1:18–25). However, this is debated, as betrothal was not equivalent to modern engagement.\n- **Gradualist View**: Some suggest that while premarital sex is not ideal, it is not the unforgivable sin, and grace should be extended to those who repent. This view emphasizes growth in holiness over perfection.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Pastoral Considerations**\nFor Christians struggling with this issue, several pastoral principles apply:\n- **Grace and Repentance**: All sin—including sexual sin—can be forgiven through Christ (1 John 1:9). The church should offer grace, not condemnation, to those who repent.\n- **Accountability and Discipleship**: Believers are called to \"flee sexual immorality\" (1 Corinthians 6:18) and to pursue holiness with the help of the Holy Spirit and the Christian community.\n- **Wisdom in Relationships**: Couples should set boundaries to avoid temptation (e.g., avoiding alone time in private settings, seeking mentorship).\n- **Marriage Preparation**: For engaged couples, premarital counseling can help them build a strong, God-honoring marriage.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Conclusion: A Biblical Summary**\nThe Bible’s teaching on sex before marriage can be summarized as follows:\n1. **Sex is a good gift from God**, designed for the lifelong, covenantal union of one man and one woman in marriage.\n2. **All sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage is sinful** (*porneia*), including premarital sex, adultery, and other forms of sexual immorality.\n3. **Cohabitation is not explicitly condemned but is unwise** because it can lead to temptation, undermine the sacredness of marriage, and harm the Christian witness.\n4. **Christians are called to holiness**, which includes sexual purity, self-control, and honoring God with their bodies.\n5. **Grace is available for those who fail**, but repentance and growth in holiness are expected.\n\nWhile cultural attitudes toward sex have shifted dramatically, the biblical standard remains unchanged. For Christians, the question is not \"What can I get away with?\" but \"How can I honor God with my body and my relationships?\" The call to sexual purity is not a burden but an invitation to experience God’s best for human flourishing.\n\n---\n\n### **Further Reading**\n- **Books**:\n  - *Sex and the Supremacy of Christ* (John Piper & Justin Taylor)\n  - *The Meaning of Marriage* (Timothy Keller)\n  - *God, Sex, and Your Marriage* (Juliet Van Heerden)\n  - *Holy Sexuality and the Gospel* (Christopher Yuan)\n- **Articles**:\n  - \"What Does the Bible Really Teach About Homosexuality?\" (Kevin DeYoung) – While focused on homosexuality, it addresses broader sexual ethics.\n  - \"Premarital Sex: A Biblical Perspective\" (Albert Mohler)\n\nWould you like to explore any specific aspect of this topic further?",
