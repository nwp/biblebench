    "expected": "Catholics emphasize justification as a process involving faith plus works (sanctification), where grace infuses the believer and makes them actually righteous over time. Protestants emphasize justification as a one-time legal declaration where God imputes Christ's righteousness to the believer through faith alone, though they also affirm sanctification as a separate process. Both agree justification requires God's grace and Christ's work, but differ on the role of works and whether justification is declarative or transformative.",

            "Common-ground statement 'Salvation is by grace alone' is not an accurate Catholic formulation; Catholic teaching emphasizes grace received through faith working in love and requires cooperation with grace, not 'sola gratia' as a standalone principle.",
            "Catholic depiction of justification as 'declaration and transformative process' is broadly correct, but the simplification that justification 'can be lost' through mortal sin and 'regained' omits nuances about baptism, the persistence of grace, and distinctions between initial justification, ongoing sanctification, and the state of grace.",
            "Some Protestant positions (especially via Luther/Calvin) emphasize imputed righteousness and forensic justification; other Protestant traditions (e.g., Anglican/Methodist nuances) stress a stronger role for transformation and sanctification. The response would benefit from acknowledging this variety within Protestantism rather than treating it as monolithic.",
            "While the 1999 Joint Declaration is accurately referenced, the summary could overstate consensus by implying full agreement on all points; the Declaration clarifies many points but leaves some distinctions intact."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer correctly highlights the core divide (forensic declaration vs. transformative process) and notes common ground and the JDDJ context. However, it risks misrepresenting Catholic doctrine by using 'grace alone' as a shared baseline and would benefit from more precise language on baptism, initial justification, and the nuances of sanctification in both traditions. It also could acknowledge the spectrum of Protestant views rather than a single 'Protestant' box."

          "explanation": "Overall, the response presents both Catholic and Protestant perspectives with notable balance and cites the 1999 Joint Declaration to acknowledge cross-tradition agreement. A minor bias is evident in the Protestant section’s heading ('The Protestant View (Particularly Reformed/Lutheran)'), which foregrounds a Protestant subtradition. Additionally, the statement under 'Common Ground' that 'Salvation is by grace alone' aligns more with Protestant language and could be read as underemphasizing the Catholic emphasis on cooperation with grace and merit. The Orthodox perspective and broader ecumenical nuances are not addressed, but the scope is explicitly Catholic vs. Protestant. Overall, the piece is ecumenical but could improve by avoiding one-sided phrasing and by acknowledging fuller Catholic nuance about merit and cooperation. "
