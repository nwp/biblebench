    "input": "Is homosexuality a sin according to the Bible?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "The interpretation of homosexuality in the Bible is a topic of significant debate among Christian traditions, and perspectives vary widely based on theological, cultural, and hermeneutical approaches. Here is a summary of the key points often discussed:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Key Biblical Passages**\nThe main passages traditionally referenced in discussions about homosexuality are:\n\n- **Old Testament:**  \n  - **Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13** – Prohibit male same-sex relations, calling them an \"abomination\" (Hebrew: *toevah*). These laws are part of the Holiness Code given to ancient Israel.\n\n- **New Testament:**  \n  - **Romans 1:26–27** – Paul describes same-sex relations as \"unnatural\" and resulting from idolatry.  \n  - **1 Corinthians 6:9–10 & 1 Timothy 1:9–10** – Include Greek terms (*malakoi* and *arsenokoitai*) often interpreted as referring to homosexual acts.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Different Interpretations**\n\n#### **Traditional / Conservative View**\n- Holds that the Bible consistently condemns homosexual acts as sinful, based on a literal reading of the above texts.\n- Sees marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6).\n- Believes sexual intimacy is only permitted within heterosexual marriage.\n\n#### **Progressive / Affirming View**\n- Argues that biblical texts must be understood in their historical and cultural context.\n- Suggerves that the Bible addresses specific ancient practices (e.g., temple prostitution, pederasty, exploitative relationships) rather than loving, consensual same-sex relationships.\n- Emphasizes broader biblical themes of love, justice, and inclusion (Galatians 3:28, 1 John 4:7–8).\n\n#### **Moderate / Contextual Views**\n- Some denominations distinguish between orientation (not sinful) and acts (sinful).\n- Others prioritize pastoral care while maintaining traditional teachings.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Historical & Cultural Context**\n- Ancient concepts of sexuality differed greatly from modern understandings. The Bible does not address sexual orientation as an innate identity.\n- The term \"homosexuality\" was not coined until the 19th century.\n- Some scholars argue that biblical authors had no concept of committed, monogamous same-sex partnerships as we understand them today.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Modern Denominational Positions**\n- **Affirming:** United Church of Christ, Episcopal Church (USA), Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (some), Presbyterian Church (USA), and others ordain LGBTQ+ clergy and perform same-sex marriages.\n- **Non-Affirming:** Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox churches, Southern Baptist Convention, and many evangelical churches teach that homosexual acts are sinful, though orientations are not always condemned.\n- **Mixed or Regional Differences:** Anglican Communion, United Methodist Church (though splitting over this issue), and others have internal divisions.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Personal & Theological Reflection**\nMany Christians encourage studying Scripture, prayer, and discernment within community. Key questions often include:\n- How do we interpret ancient texts in light of modern knowledge?\n- How do we balance tradition with compassion and justice?\n- What is the role of cultural context in biblical interpretation?\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhether the Bible defines homosexuality as a sin depends largely on one’s interpretive framework, tradition, and understanding of biblical authority. There is no single, universally accepted Christian position. Many encourage respectful dialogue, empathy, and a focus on core teachings of love, mercy, and the dignity of all people.\n\nIf you are exploring this question for personal or spiritual reasons, engaging with diverse theological perspectives and scholarly resources may be helpful.",
