    "input": "How do different Christian traditions view the role of church tradition and authority?",
    "expected": "Catholic and Orthodox traditions view church tradition as equally authoritative with Scripture, believing the church's teaching authority (magisterium in Catholicism) reliably interprets both. Protestants hold to 'sola scriptura' - Scripture alone as the final authority, though they value historical creeds and confessions as subordinate standards. Anglicans often take a middle position, valuing tradition and reason alongside Scripture (the 'three-legged stool'). These differences affect views on everything from papal authority to how doctrines develop. Despite differences, all agree Scripture is essential and authoritative.",
    "output": "# Church Tradition and Authority: A Survey of Christian Perspectives\n\n## The Central Question\n\nHow does God's truth reach and guide His people? All Christian traditions agree that God reveals Himself, but they differ significantly on the relationship between Scripture, tradition, and ecclesiastical authority.\n\n---\n\n## **Roman Catholic Perspective**\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that divine revelation comes through **Scripture and Sacred Tradition** together, with the **Magisterium** (teaching authority) serving as the authentic interpreter of both.\n\n**Key convictions:**\n- Tradition is not separate from Scripture but the living transmission of the apostolic deposit\n- The Pope, as successor of Peter, holds a unique teaching office, including infallibility under specific conditions (Vatican I)\n- Ecumenical councils, in union with the Pope, can define doctrine bindingly\n- The Church precedes the written New Testament and authenticated the canon\n\n*\"Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture form one sacred deposit of the Word of God\"* — Dei Verbum\n\n---\n\n## **Eastern Orthodox Perspective**\n\nOrthodoxy emphasizes **Holy Tradition** as the life of the Holy Spirit in the Church—a living, organic reality rather than merely accumulated teachings.\n\n**Key convictions:**\n- The seven Ecumenical Councils hold supreme doctrinal authority\n- Authority is **conciliar** rather than papal; no single bishop holds universal jurisdiction\n- Tradition includes liturgy, iconography, patristic consensus, and the Church's phronema (mind)\n- Scripture exists *within* Tradition, not alongside or above it as a separate category\n- The Church as a whole, guided by the Spirit, cannot ultimately err\n\n---\n\n## **Confessional Protestant Perspectives**\n\n### Lutheran\nLutherans affirm **sola Scriptura** while maintaining significant respect for tradition:\n- Scripture alone is the norming norm (*norma normans*)\n- The Lutheran Confessions (Book of Concord) are authoritative as correct expositions of Scripture\n- The church fathers are valuable witnesses, not binding authorities\n- Tradition is retained where it doesn't contradict Scripture\n\n### Reformed/Presbyterian\nThe Reformed tradition emphasizes:\n- Scripture as the **sole infallible rule** of faith and practice\n- Confessions (Westminster, Heidelberg, Belgic) as subordinate standards\n- Church courts (sessions, presbyteries, assemblies) have real but ministerial authority\n- The regulative principle: worship should include only what Scripture commands\n\n### Anglican\nAnglicanism historically articulates a **three-legged stool**:\n- Scripture as containing all things necessary for salvation (Article VI)\n- Tradition (especially the early church) as a guide to interpretation\n- Reason as a tool for understanding both\n- Significant diversity exists between Anglo-Catholic and Evangelical Anglican emphases\n\n---\n\n## **Free Church and Baptist Perspectives**\n\nThese traditions emphasize:\n- **Soul competency**: each believer can interpret Scripture under the Spirit's guidance\n- **Local church autonomy**: no binding authority above the congregation\n- Creeds and confessions as helpful but never binding\n- Suspicion of tradition as potentially obscuring biblical clarity\n- The \"restoration\" impulse: returning to New Testament patterns\n\n---\n\n## **Pentecostal and Charismatic Perspectives**\n\nWhile generally Protestant in orientation, these traditions add emphasis on:\n- **Ongoing prophetic revelation** (though typically subordinate to Scripture)\n- The **present voice of the Spirit** in the community\n- Less formal creedal structures\n- Experience as confirming (not establishing) truth\n- Varying approaches—some quite traditional, others more spontaneous\n\n---\n\n## Points of Genuine Agreement\n\nDespite differences, orthodox Christians across traditions affirm:\n\n1. **God has definitively revealed Himself** in Christ and through inspired Scripture\n2. **The ancient creeds** (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) express essential Christian truth\n3. **The Holy Spirit guides the Church** into truth\n4. **Individual interpretation has limits**—we read within community\n5. **Some interpretive framework** is inevitable and necessary\n\n---\n\n## Respectful Observations\n\nEach tradition addresses real theological concerns:\n\n- **Catholics and Orthodox** rightly emphasize that Christianity is not merely a book religion—it is a *lived faith* transmitted through communities, and the Bible itself emerged from the Church's life.\n\n- **Protestants** rightly warn that human traditions can obscure or contradict God's Word, and that all teaching must remain answerable to Scripture.\n\n- **Free Church traditions** rightly protect against coercive uniformity and honor the priesthood of all believers.\n\n- **All traditions** face the honest challenge: *everyone* has interpretive traditions; the question is whether we acknowledge them and test them.\n\n---\n\n## A Humble Conclusion\n\nThe differences here are genuine and consequential—they touch on how we know what we know about God.

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately summarizes major Christian traditions on the relationship between Scripture, Tradition, and ecclesial authority. It correctly characterizes Catholic magisterial teaching (Scripture and Sacred Tradition as a single deposit of the Word of God, with the Magisterium and infallible papal definitions under certain conditions), Eastern Orthodox emphasis on Holy Tradition and conciliar authority, and Protestant assertions of Scripture as the norm with subordinate confessions (Lutheran, Reformed) or congregational governance (Free Church/Baptist). It also notes Anglican via media and the broader Pentecostal/Charismatic emphasis on ongoing Spirit-led guidance alongside Scripture. The piece highlights genuine agreement points (divine revelation in Scripture, creeds, Spirit’s guidance, limits to individual interpretation) and acknowledges important nuances (conciliar vs. papal authority, place of tradition, Regulative Principle for worship in Reformed contexts, etc.). Therefore, it is doctrinally sound, nuanced, and biblically grounded in the sense that it centers on Scripture as God’s revealed Word and on the Spirit’s ongoing work in the Church. No explicit theological errors stand out; potential sensitivities (e.g., precise formulations about church authority and infallibility) are presented with standard, widely accepted distinctions. Suggested improvement could include brief caveats about the variability within each tradition (e.g., scope of infallibility, exact boundaries of tradition vs. Scripture in practice) for even finer-grained accuracy."
