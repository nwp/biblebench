The author is not plainly identified in the text as 'the disciple whom Jesus loved.'",
            "Other minor nuance: The answer correctly covers main positions (traditional authorship, Johannine community theory, anonymous authorship) and dating range, but could acknowledge that some scholars question even John the Apostle as the source in the traditional sense, and that the designation of 'the beloved disciple' is an interpretive tradition rather than an explicit self-identification by the author."

          "rationale": "The response is largely accurate and well-rounded, outlining traditional attribution, internal/narrative evidence, and scholarly debates. The principal factual issue is a nuanced misreading: the Gospel text does not explicitly identify the author as 'the disciple whom Jesus loved,' though it does present the beloved disciple as a key figure. This misstatement affects the factual accuracy while the broader discussion remains valid and well-contextualized."
