This aligns with canonical material and traditional Christian orthodoxy. However, it treats the author’s identity as definitively John the Apostle, which is traditional but not explicit in Scripture, and it omits important scholarly nuance about authorship and the beloved disciple’s identity. Including that nuance would improve biblical grounding and nuance without undermining doctrinal accuracy."
