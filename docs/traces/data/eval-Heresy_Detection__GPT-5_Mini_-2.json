    "input": "A preacher claims: 'Salvation is achieved through good works and moral living. If you live a good life, you will earn your way to heaven.' Is this biblical teaching?",
    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "Short answer: No — the claim that you can “earn your way to heaven” by good works and moral living is not biblical and is contrary to historic Christian orthodoxy. It reflects works-righteousness (often associated with Pelagianism), which the church has consistently rejected.\n\nWhy this is unbiblical (scripture summaries)\n- Salvation is a gift of God’s grace received by faith. Key texts: Ephesians 2:8–9 — “For by grace you have been saved through faith… not a result of works, so that no one may boast.” Romans 3:23–24 and Titus 3:5 present justification and salvation as God’s merciful gift, not human merit.\n- Justification is not by human merit. Paul repeatedly argues that no one is justified by works of the law (Romans 3; Galatians 2:16; Galatians 3:11).\n- Good works are not irrelevant — they are the fruit and evidence of true faith. James 2:14–26 teaches that genuine faith results in works; faith without works is dead. But James is addressing the living quality of faith, not saying works are the grounds by which God declares a sinner righteous.\n- Biblical balance: faith unites us to Christ (the ground of our righteousness); the Spirit produces holiness and good works (sanctification) that confirm genuine faith (Philippians 1:6; Galatians 5:22–23).\n\nHistorical-theological context\n- The claim echoes Pelagianism (and later semi-Pelagianism), which minimized the need for prevenient grace and asserted that humans can merit salvation by their efforts. Augustine and the later ecumenical consensus rejected this.\n- During the Reformation, Protestants affirmed sola gratia / sola fide (grace alone / faith alone) against what they saw as works-righteousness. Reformers taught that good works follow justification but do not procure it.\n- Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions affirm the necessity of grace and the importance of works and cooperation with grace. However, classical Catholic and Orthodox teaching does not reduce salvation to mere human earning; it locates justification and salvation in God’s grace working through faith, sacraments, and a life of holiness. Even those traditions distinguish between cooperating with grace and “earning” salvation in a purely meritocratic sense.\n\nPractical and pastoral consequences\n- Teaching salvation as earned by works leads to legalism, spiritual pride, and insecurity (always wondering if you’ve done enough). The New Testament’s answer is assurance grounded in Christ’s finished work and lived out in grateful obedience.\n- True Christian moral living is commanded and expected — but it flows from union with Christ and the Holy Spirit, not from a successful self-salvation project.\n\nConclusion\nThe preacher’s statement is not biblical orthodox teaching. Scripture and the historic church teach that salvation is by God’s grace received through faith in Christ; good works are the necessary fruit and evidence of that saving faith, not the ground by which one “earns” heaven.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately summarizes biblical teaching and historic orthodoxy: salvation is by grace received through faith, not by works; good works are the fruit and evidence of genuine faith, not the ground of justification. It cites key texts (Ephesians 2:8–9; Romans 3:23–24; Titus 3:5; Galatians 2:16; Galatians 3:11; James 2:14–26; Philippians 1:6; Galatians 5:22–23) and addresses the distinction between justification and sanctification. It situates the claim in the historical context of Pelagianism and the Reformation, while noting broader Catholic/Orthodox positions that emphasize grace and cooperation with grace without reducing salvation to merit. The practical note on assurance and the fruitfulness of holiness is sound. Minor caveats exist in the nuanced debates around James 2 and how various traditions articulate justification, but the overall assessment is doctrinally solid and biblically grounded."
