It neither fully rejects nor uncritically adopts non-Christian practices; instead it promotes a thoughtful, contextual approach (i.e., “borrow thoughtfully, with theological awareness”) and offers Christian alternatives (contemplative prayer, breath prayer, liturgical movement). This balance reflects a traditional pastoral caution with room for measured flexibility, characteristic of a moderate-conservative stance. The framing is pastoral and nuanced rather than dogmatic, and it presents multiple angles rather than a single definitive position, signaling both fidelity to traditional concerns and openness to thoughtful adaptation.",

It then offers a nuanced middle-ground: borrow thoughtfully, with theological awareness. This indicates no single, clear progressive or conservative stance is being endorsed. It explicitly acknowledges disagreement by detailing the concerns of both sides and the practical criteria for evaluating practices. It presents alternatives fairly, outlining the reasoning behind each position and concluding with practical guidance rather than doctrinal certainty. The tone is humble and invitational, evidenced by questions like “What aspect concerns you most?” and the cautious phrasing, rather than dogmatic certainty."
