    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "The **doctrine of the resurrection of the body** teaches that, at the end of the age, God will **raise the dead bodily**, reuniting and transforming human persons so that they live again as embodied creatures—either unto **everlasting life** or unto **judgment**—within God’s final, renewed creation.\n\nThis is not a peripheral belief. It is part of the church’s historic confession: “**I believe in the resurrection of the body**” (Apostles’ Creed) and “we look for the resurrection of the dead” (Nicene Creed).\n\n## 1) What “resurrection of the body” means\n### A. It is truly bodily, not merely spiritual survival\nScripture distinguishes the **continued existence of the soul** from the **resurrection of the body**. The resurrection is not simply that a person “lives on” spiritually; it is God’s act of **raising the whole person** to embodied life.\n\n- Jesus speaks of a coming hour when “**all who are in the tombs** will hear his voice and come out” (John 5:28–29).\n- Daniel foretells that “many…who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake” (Daniel 12:2).\n\nSo resurrection concerns those who are **dead and buried**, not merely souls in heaven.\n\n### B. It is continuity *and* transformation\nResurrection is not reincarnation (a different body and different identity), nor is it merely resuscitation (a return to ordinary mortal life, like Lazarus). It is **the same person raised**, yet **transformed** to immortal, glorified life.\n\nPaul teaches both continuity and change:\n\n- “this perishable body must put on the imperishable” (1 Corinthians 15:53)\n- it is “sown…perishable” and “raised…imperishable,” “sown…in dishonor” and “raised…in glory” (1 Corinthians 15:42–44)\n\nWhen Paul speaks of a “**spiritual body**” (1 Corinthians 15:44), he does not mean nonphysical. He means a body **animated and empowered by the Holy Spirit**, no longer dominated by sin, decay, and death.\n\n### C. It is the completion of salvation, not an optional add-on\nBiblically, salvation is not the escape of souls from bodies; it is God’s redemption of his creation and of human beings as embodied image-bearers.\n\n- “the creation itself will be set free” (Romans 8:21)\n- believers “wait eagerly for adoption…**the redemption of our bodies**” (Romans 8:23)\n\n## 2) The resurrection is grounded in Christ’s resurrection\nThe clearest foundation for the doctrine is the bodily resurrection of Jesus.\n\n- The risen Christ shows continuity with his crucified body (“see my hands and my feet…a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have,” Luke 24:39), yet he is also glorified (no longer subject to death; Romans 6:9).\n- Paul calls Christ “**the firstfruits** of those who have fallen asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20). His resurrection is the beginning and guarantee of the believer’s.\n\nBecause Christ is risen bodily, the future resurrection is not speculative—it is the outworking of what has already occurred in him.\n\n## 3) Who will be raised?\nScripture teaches a **general resurrection** of both the righteous and the wicked:\n\n- “those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment” (John 5:29)\n- “a resurrection of both the just and the unjust” (Acts 24:15)\n\nThus resurrection is universal; what differs is the outcome: **life in communion with God** or **judgment**.\n\n## 4) When will it happen?\nThe New Testament locates the resurrection at Christ’s return and the consummation.\n\n- “the dead will be raised imperishable” at “the last trumpet” (1 Corinthians 15:52)\n- “the dead in Christ will rise first” when the Lord descends (1 Thessalonians 4:16)\n- it is associated with final judgment and the arrival of the new creation (Revelation 20–22)\n\nChristians sometimes discuss the **intermediate state** (the condition between death and resurrection). Scripture suggests conscious fellowship with Christ after death (e.g., Philippians 1:23; Luke 23:43), but it still treats the **resurrection** as the believer’s full, final hope (Romans 8:23; 2 Corinthians 5:1–5).\n\n## 5) What will the resurrected body be like?\nScripture describes resurrected life with reverent restraint, but it gives real content:\n\n- **Immortal and incorruptible:** no decay, no death (1 Corinthians 15:42–54)\n- **Glorified and powerful:** raised “in glory…in power” (1 Corinthians 15:43)\n- **Conformed to Christ:** “will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body” (Philippians 3:20–21)\n- **Fully holy in God’s presence:** resurrection life belongs to the age where sin and curse are removed (Revelation 21:3–5)\n\n## 6) Why the doctrine matters\n1. **It affirms the goodness of creation and the body.** God made embodied life and redeems it; Christianity is not ultimately anti-material (Genesis 1; Romans 8).\n2. **It secures Christian hope.** The final hope is not disembodied “heaven” alone, but resurrection life in the renewed creation (Revelation 21–22).\n3. **It shapes ethics and perseverance.** “Be steadfast…knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain” precisely because resurrection is real (1 Corinthians 15:58).\n4. **It safeguards the gospel itself.** Paul treats denial of bodily resurrection as a denial of the faith’s core: “if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile” (1 Corinthians 15:17).\n\n**In sum:** the resurrection of the body is God’s promised, end-time act of raising the dead—patterned after Christ’s own resurrection—so that human persons live eternally as embodied creatures in God’s final kingdom, either unto life or unto judgment.",

It emphasizes the completeness of salvation, the goodness of creation, and the future new creation, while acknowledging nuances about the intermediate state and the meaning of Paul’s phrase “spiritual body.” Citations to key texts (John 5, 1 Cor 15, Romans 8, Phil 3, Luke 24, etc.) align with Scripture and historic confessional language (Apostles’ and Nicene Creeds). The only potential caveats are minor exegetical nuances some traditions debate (e.g., exact timing and nature of the intermediate state) which the answer itself does acknowledge. Overall, it is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."

          "explanation": "The response presents a solid, historically orthodox view of the resurrection of the body. It affirmatively states bodily resurrection, not merely spiritual survival, and it emphasizes continuity and transformation (not reincarnation or mere resuscitation). It grounds the doctrine in Christ’s resurrection, cites Scripture (e.g., 1 Cor 15; John 5:29; Rom 8:23; Phil 3:21), and treats the universal scope of the resurrection with final outcomes of life or judgment. It acknowledges the intermediate state while maintaining the final, eschatological hope of the bodily resurrection in the new creation. It explicitly counters common heresies by upholding a physical, glorified body and denying Docetism/gnosis-like ideas. The only potential area for caution is the phrase “universal resurrection”—the text immediately clarifies that the final outcome depends on faithfulness (life with God or judgment), thereby avoiding universalism. Overall, no heresy is present; the teaching aligns with historic confessional orthodoxy (Apostles’ Creed, Nicene Creed)."
