    "expected": "This resembles Marcionism, a second-century heresy that rejected the Old Testament and taught there were two different gods. This is false. Orthodox Christianity affirms the unity of God across both Testaments. The same God who created the world, gave the law, and showed justice in the Old Testament is the God who sent Jesus. Jesus himself affirmed the Old Testament (Matthew 5:17-18) and revealed God's character as both just and merciful throughout scripture.",
    "output": "### Classification: Heresy (Marcionism)\n\nThe statement represents a classic form of **Marcionism**, a heresy condemned by the early Christian church in the 2nd century AD. It is not orthodox Christian teaching, which affirms the **unity and immutability (unchanging nature) of God** across both the Old Testament (OT) and New Testament (NT). Here's a step-by-step explanation of why this view is theologically erroneous, drawing from Scripture, church doctrine, and historical context.\n\n#### 1. **Core Orthodox Christian Teaching: One God, Eternally the Same**\n   - **Biblical Foundation**: Christianity confesses *one God* (Deut 6:4; Isa 45:5; Mark 12:29–32; 1 Cor 8:6). Jesus explicitly identifies the OT God (Yahweh) as his Father: \"I and the Father are one\" (John 10:30); \"He who has seen me has seen the Father\" (John 14:9). The NT repeatedly quotes and affirms the OT as God's inspired word (e.g., Matt 5:17–18: \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them\"; 2 Tim 3:16).\n   - **Doctrinal Continuity**: The Nicene Creed (AD 325/381), a cornerstone of orthodoxy, confesses \"one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth,\" echoing OT language (Gen 1:1; Exod 20:11) while affirming Jesus as \"God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God.\" God's attributes—holiness, justice, mercy, love, and wrath against sin—are consistent (Mal 3:6: \"I the Lord do not change\"; Heb 13:8: \"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever\"; James 1:17).\n   - **Trinitarian Unity**: The Father (OT emphasis), Son (NT incarnation), and Spirit are one essence (homoousios), not separate gods. Dividing them contradicts the Trinity.\n\n#### 2. **What's Heretical About the Statement**\n   - **Divides God's Nature**: Claiming the OT God is \"wrathful and evil\" while the NT God (via Jesus) is \"true and good\" posits *two gods*—a Demiurge (evil creator) and a higher, loving God. This is dualism, alien to biblical monotheism and echoing Gnostic ideas.\n   - **Mischaracterizes God's Wrath**: Wrath is not \"evil\" but a holy response to sin (Rom 1:18: \"The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness\"; cf. Exod 34:6–7, where God is \"merciful and gracious, slow to anger\" *yet* punishing iniquity). Jesus embodies both grace *and* wrath (John 2:13–17, cleansing the temple; Matt 23, woes on Pharisees; Rev 19:15, judging nations). The cross reconciles justice and mercy (Rom 3:25–26).\n   - **Rejects OT Authority**: This view nullifies the OT, but Jesus upheld it (Luke 24:27, 44; Matt 22:37–40). Paul calls Abraham, Moses, and David exemplars of faith (Rom 4; Heb 11).\n\n#### 3. **Historical Context and Condemnation**\n   - **Marcion of Sinope (c. AD 85–160)**: A wealthy shipowner who created his own canon—edited Luke's Gospel and 10 Pauline epistles—rejecting the OT and any Jewish elements. He taught the OT God was harsh and legalistic, distinct from Jesus' Father.\n   - **Church Response**: \n     - **Irenaeus of Lyons** (c. AD 130–202) refuted it in *Against Heresies* (Book 1), arguing Marcion mutilated Scripture and ignored God's unity.\n     - **Tertullian** (c. AD 155–240) wrote *Against Marcion* (5 books), proving NT continuity with OT.\n     - **Muratorian Canon** (c. AD 170) and later councils affirmed the full OT+NT canon.\n   - Marcion was excommunicated by Rome (AD 144). The heresy influenced later Gnosticism but was universally rejected.\n\n#### 4. **Consequences of This View**\n   - **Undermines the Gospel**: Jesus' atonement requires the same holy God who demands justice (OT Law) and provides mercy (NT cross).\n   - **Promotes Antisemitism**: Historically fueled contempt for Judaism by demonizing the OT God.\n   - **Logical Absurdity**: If Jesus reveals a \"different\" God, why did he cite the OT 78 times (per Gospels), fulfill its prophecies (Isa 53; Ps 22), and command love for God and neighbor from Deuteronomy and Leviticus (Matt 22:37–40)?\n\nIn summary, this is not a mere interpretive difference but a **fundamental denial of God's oneness and immutability**, condemned as heresy since the apostolic era. Orthodox Christianity celebrates the *harmony* of Scripture: the wrathful Judge of the OT is the loving Father of the NT, fully revealed in Christ (Heb 1:1–3). For deeper reading, see Irenaeus or modern works like *The God of the Old Testament* by R.W.L. Moberly.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately identifies the view as Marcionism, a historic heresy that posits two gods and rejects the OT as revelatory of the true God. It rightly affirms the orthodox Christian view of God’s unity and immutability across both Testaments, and it correctly notes that Jesus upholds the authority of the OT (citing Matthew 5:17–18, Luke 24:27, 44, etc.) and presents God’s character as consistently holy, just, merciful, and loving. The response articulates the theological problem with alleging two gods (a demiurge vs. the Father) and treats wrath as a holy response to sin, not evil in itself, aligning with Romans 1, Exodus 34:6–7, Hebrews 13:8, and related passages. It also ties in the atonement (Rom 3:25–26) as the reconciliation of justice and mercy, which preserves the integrity of the gospel. Historically, it correctly mentions Marcion’s condemnation by early church fathers (Irenaeus, Tertullian) and the canon/creedal developments that reaffirmed the OT+NT unity. The nuance is present: it emphasizes doctrinal continuity, Trinitarian unity, and the danger of dualism or anti-Jewish polemics that can arise from such a view. Minor caveats are possible in emphasis (e.g., the historical claim about the extent of anti-Judaism associated with Marcion is nuanced in scholarly discussion), but these do not significantly undermine the overall accuracy. Overall, the answer is faithful to Scripture, historically orthodox, and captures important theological nuances about God’s nature across the Testaments.} <|end_of_response|> \\ 0.92-0.95 range could also be considered; the above is a precise, concise evaluation.
