        "input": "A Christian couple asks you to officiate their same-sex wedding. What do you tell them?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "First, it’s important to remember that a wedding ceremony is both a deeply personal celebration for the couple and, for many, a religious rite that carries theological weight for the officiant. Navigating a request that sits at the intersection of those two realms can be uncomfortable, but a compassionate, honest, and respectful conversation is the best way forward. Below is a step‑by‑step approach you might find helpful—whether you are a pastor, a deacon, a lay minister, or simply someone the couple has asked to lead their ceremony.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Pause and Clarify Your Own Position\n\n| Question to Ask Yourself | Why It Matters |\n|--------------------------|----------------|\n| **What are my personal convictions about same‑sex marriage?** | Knowing where you stand will help you answer honestly rather than reactively. |\n| **What does my denomination or faith community officially teach?** | Some churches have formal policies (e.g., “marriage is between a man and a woman”), while others leave room for pastoral discretion. |\n| **Am I willing to officiate despite a doctrinal conflict?** | If you feel you could do so in good conscience, that’s a different scenario than if you would feel you’re betraying your own faith. |\n| **Do I have a legal ability (or restriction) to perform the ceremony in my jurisdiction?** | Some regions require the officiant to be ordained or otherwise authorized. |\n\nIf the answer to any of these ends with a firm “no,” you’ll likely need to decline— but you can still do so in a way that honors the couple.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Meet with the Couple in a Private, Unhurried Setting\n\n### a. **Express Gratitude and Respect**\n\n> “Thank you both for trusting me with something so important to you.”\n\n### b. **Invite Them to Share Their Vision**\n\nAsk them what they hope the ceremony will look like, what language they’d like used, and which aspects of the Christian tradition (if any) they want to incorporate. Understanding their expectations will help you assess whether you can meet them where they are.\n\n### c. **Share Your Perspective Transparently**\n\nIf you feel comfortable doing so, briefly state where you stand:\n\n- **If you *can* officiate** (because your personal and denominational convictions align with an inclusive view):  \n  > “I share your belief that love is God’s gift, and I would be honored to pray with you and bless your marriage.”\n\n- **If you *cannot* officiate** (because it conflicts with your conscience or church policy):  \n  > “I’m truly sorry, but officiating a same‑sex marriage conflicts with my personal convictions and the teachings of my faith community. I would never want to compromise either my belief or your celebration.”\n\n### d. **Offer Alternatives (If Declining)**\n\n- **Refer Them to an Inclusive Clergy**: Provide names, contact information, or a directory (e.g., the Gay & Lesbian Christian Fellowship, the LGBT Religious Archives, or the Denominational “Love Welcomes All” list).\n- **Suggest a Secular Officiant**: A judge, justice of the peace, or a professional celebrant can legally marry them.\n- **Offer Non‑Officiant Support**: You could still help with premarital counseling, write a personal blessing to be read during the ceremony, or assist with planning logistics—provided those roles don’t require you to perform a marriage rite.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Frame the Conversation in Core Christian Values\n\nEven if you must decline, you can ground your response in love, humility, and respect—principles that echo the Gospel:\n\n1. **Love** – “I love you both and want what’s best for you.”\n2. **Truth** – “I must be honest about my spiritual boundaries.”\n3. **Service** – “I want to help you find the right person to celebrate your covenant.”\n4. **Community** – “Our church community values each person, and I hope you find a place where you feel fully welcomed.”\n\n---\n\n## 4. Follow Up in Writing (Optional but Helpful)\n\nA brief, courteous email or letter can prevent misunderstandings later:\n\n> Dear [Names],  \n> Thank you again for inviting me to be part of your wedding day. After prayerful reflection, I have concluded that I am not able to officiate your marriage ceremony because [brief reason—personal conviction, denominational policy, etc.]. I truly wish you a beautiful celebration and a blessed life together. If you would like, I can connect you with several clergy who regularly officiate same‑sex marriages. Please let me know how else I may support you.  \n> With love and respect,  \n> [Your Name]\n\n---\n\n## 5. Reflect on the Experience\n\nRegardless of the outcome, take time to:\n\n- **Pray or meditate** (depending on your tradition) about how this interaction can deepen your own spiritual walk.\n- **Seek counsel** from a trusted mentor, spiritual director, or denominational leader if you feel torn.\n- **Consider the broader conversation** about inclusion in your faith community—perhaps this moment can be a catalyst for dialogue, even if you personally remain opposed.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Scripts for Common Scenarios\n\n| Situation | Sample Script |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| **You are comfortable officiating** | “I’m delighted to stand with you as you pledge your lives to each other. Let’s talk about how we can weave Scripture, prayer, and your personal story into a ceremony that honors both your love and our faith.” |\n| **Your denomination forbids it, but you’re personally supportive** | “My denomination does not permit us to officiate same‑sex marriages, even though my heart affirms your love. I’m happy to help you find a pastor from a more inclusive body who can celebrate you fully.” |\n| **You’re opposed on theological grounds** | “I respect and love you both, but I’m not able to officiate because I believe marriage, as understood in my tradition, is between a man and a woman. I hope you understand that this is about my conviction, not a judgment on you.” |\n| **You’re uncertain and need more time** | “Thank you for sharing this with me. I need a few days to pray and reflect before I give you an answer I can stand behind. Can we reconvene on [date]?” |\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n- **Honesty and compassion are not mutually exclusive.** You can decline (or accept) while still honoring the couple’s dignity.\n- **Know your own theological and institutional limits** before you speak.\n- **Offer concrete alternatives** if you are unable to officiate, showing that you care about their joy even if you can’t be the celebrant.\n- **Root your response in the Christian virtues of love, truth, service, and community**, which help keep the conversation constructive and respectful.\n\nBy approaching the request with a clear conscience, a listening heart, and a willingness to help—even if that help comes in the form of a referral—you uphold both your own faith integrity and the couple’s right to a loving, recognized marriage.",
