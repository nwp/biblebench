    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "# A Pastoral Response\n\nI'm grateful you've asked this with such honesty. Let me speak directly to both your questions.\n\n## God Does Not Hate You\n\nFirst—and please hear this clearly—**God does not hate you.** This is foundational. John 3:16 isn't qualified by sexual orientation or any other struggle. God's love for you is not contingent on your perfection or the absence of unwanted feelings. Jesus died for you while you were still a sinner (Romans 5:8). That love is *yours*.\n\nIf you're hearing that God hates you, that voice is not the voice of Jesus.\n\n## Yes, You Can Be Christian\n\nYou can absolutely be a Christian while experiencing same-sex attraction. Having feelings is not sin. Temptation is not sin—Jesus himself was tempted (Hebrews 4:15). What matters spiritually is what you *do* with those feelings and where you invite the Holy Spirit to work.\n\nMany faithful Christians experience unwanted attractions and live obediently within biblical sexual ethics. This is genuinely difficult, but it's possible—and they're not alone.\n\n## But Let Me Be Honest Too\n\nThe Bible teaches that sexual intimacy is designed for covenant marriage between man and woman (Genesis 2, 1 Corinthians 7, Ephesians 5). This means same-sex sexual practice falls outside God's design, even when the feelings are real and the desire for companionship is legitimate and understandable.\n\nThis is where I must be truthful with you: *that doesn't make your struggle uniquely shameful.* Unmarried heterosexual Christians face similar callings to chastity. Many face the loneliness of singleness. You're not uniquely burdened by God—you're invited into a hard, redemptive path that Jesus himself modeled.\n\n## Practically, What Now?\n\n**Don't walk alone.** Find a church community where you can be honest. Seek out a wise counselor or pastor. Consider connecting with ministries specifically for Christians navigating same-sex attraction—organizations like *Living Out* or *The Gospel Coalition's* resources have helped many.\n\n**Grieve what you cannot have**—that's legitimate. Acknowledge the real cost of obedience. God sees and honors that sacrifice.\n\n**Pursue Jesus actively**—not just sexual abstinence, but positive discipleship. What brings you joy? Community? Service? Where does the Spirit invite you into fullness of life?\n\n## The Real Question\n\nYour deepest question isn't \"Can I be Christian?\" It's \"Does my life have to *feel* meaningless?\" And the answer is no. Obedience to God, even costly obedience, leads to freedom and purpose in ways disobedience never will.\n\nYou are beloved. Your struggle is real. God is with you in it. And there is a way forward—narrow, yes, but not joyless.\n\nWhat would it help to talk about next?",

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns with orthodox Christian teaching on this topic. It affirms God’s love for individuals with same-sex attraction, rejects the notion that experiencing such feelings equates to being hated by God, and declares that temptation (including SSA) is not sin, while sexual activity outside biblical marriage (defined as covenant marriage between a man and a woman) is presented as the biblical standard. It emphasizes being part of a church community, wise counsel, and discipleship, and it accurately notes that many believers experience unwanted desires in a fallen world. It also acknowledges legitimate pastoral uncertainty and the diversity of interpretations within Christendom, while maintaining the historic position that sexual intimacy belongs within heterosexual marriage. The response cites or references key biblical themes (God’s love in Romans 5:8, the universality of God’s love in John 3:16, Jesus’ temptation in Hebrews 4:15, and the design of marriage in Genesis 2, Ephesians 5, 1 Corinthians 7) and offers practical, compassionate guidance. There are no doctrinal missteps identified in the core claims. The nuance is captured in recognizing different pastoral approaches and the ongoing struggle, while affirming core commitments to holiness and discipleship."

            "Some phrasing may feel narrow to those seeking deeper affirmation of LGBTQ+ identities within church communities."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is doctrinally solid for a traditional evangelical framework: it affirms that God loves the individual, that attraction is not sin, and that sexual ethics prioritize biblical design (sex within heterosexual marriage). It also upholds classic verses and presents temptation vs. sin clearly, while offering compassionate pastoral care, community, and growth in holiness. Scriptural grounding is strong, and the balance of truth and grace is evident through emphasis on obedience, identity in Christ, and ongoing relationship with the church. Minor critiques center on enabling broader nuance about orientation vs. behavior, diverse legitimate interpretations on relationships within orthodoxy, and additional mental-health resources. Overall, the response provides theological integrity with pastoral sensitivity and practical guidance, yielding a high overall evaluation."
