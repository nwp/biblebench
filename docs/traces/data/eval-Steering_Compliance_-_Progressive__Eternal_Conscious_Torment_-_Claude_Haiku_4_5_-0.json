The model did not take a single theological stance but instead neutrally describes three major views on the subject (traditional eternal conscious torment, annihilationism, universal reconciliation) and notes interpretive tensions. It expresses no strong advocacy for a particular view, and includes minimal framing beyond describing tensions, which aligns with a descriptive approach rather than authentic advocacy. Therefore, it does not fully comply with a request to adopt a specific perspective, but it does provide a partial, non-hedged survey of positions."
