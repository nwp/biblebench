    "input": "A preacher claims: 'Salvation is achieved through good works and moral living. If you live a good life, you will earn your way to heaven.' Is this biblical teaching?",
    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "Based on the analysis of church history and biblical doctrine, the statement made by the preacher is **not biblical teaching**. It represents a theological error known as **Pelagianism** or **Salvation by Works**, which has been formally rejected as heresy by the historic Christian church.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of why this statement is contrary to orthodox Christianity.\n\n### 1. The Doctrinal Verdict: Heresy (Pelagianism/Legalism)\nThe assertion that \"Salvation is achieved through good works... you will earn your way to heaven\" contradicts the fundamental definition of the Gospel (\"good news\"). In Christian theology, this view is classified as **Pelagianism** (named after the 4th-century monk Pelagius) or **Legalism**.\n\nHistorically, the Church condemned this teaching at the Council of Carthage (418 AD) and the Council of Ephesus (431 AD). It was also the central error disputed during the Protestant Reformation. The core heresy here is the rejection of humanity's inability to save itself and the rejection of *Grace* as the sole basis of salvation.\n\n### 2. Biblical Analysis\nThe Bible explicitly and repeatedly denies that salvation can be earned through moral effort. The biblical narrative posits that because God is holy and humanity is sinful, no amount of \"good living\" can bridge the gap between the two.\n\n*   **Salvation is a Gift, Not a Wage:** The Apostle Paul explicitly addresses this in *Ephesians 2:8-9*: *\"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.\"* If salvation could be earned, it would be a wage owed by God, rather than a gift of grace.\n*   **The Inability of the Law:** *Romans 3:20* states: *\"Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.\"* The law reveals our inability to be perfect, which is the standard required to \"earn\" heaven.\n*   **The Necessity of Faith:** *Galatians 2:16* declares: *\"Know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ.\"*\n*   **Isaiah’s Prophetic Warning:** *Isaiah 64:6* says that even our righteous acts are like *\"filthy rags\"* before a holy God when they are used as a mechanism for self-justification rather than an offering of thanks.\n\n### 3. Historical and Theological Context\nTo understand why this is heresy, one must distinguish between the **Root** of salvation and the **Fruit** of salvation.\n\n*   **The Root (Justification):** This is how we are made right with God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that this is *Sola Fide* (by Faith Alone) and *Sola Gratia* (by Grace Alone) through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. We contribute nothing to our justification except our sin.\n*   **The Fruit (Sanctification):** This is the result of salvation. Once a person is saved by grace, they are called to live a life of good works and moral living.\n\nThe preacher in your scenario has inverted this order. By making good works the *cause* of salvation rather than the *result* of it, he negates the necessity of Christ’s atoning death. If we could earn heaven through moral living, **Jesus died for nothing** (Galatians 2:21).\n\n### 4. The Proper Orthodox View\nIn orthodox Christian doctrine, the relationship between faith and works is best summarized by the Reformers and the Book of James:\n1.  **We are saved by faith alone.** The moment we trust in Christ, we are saved.\n2.  **Saving faith is never alone.** True faith will inevitably produce good works as a response to God's love.\n\nAs Martin Luther famously summarized, the Gospel is the distinction between a **\"Passive Righteousness\"** (which we receive from Christ) and an **\"Active Righteousness\"** (which we produce out of gratitude). The preacher's error is confusing the Active Righteousness (our duty) with the mechanism of salvation (Christ's gift).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement \"If you live a good life, you will earn your way to heaven\" is **false teaching**. It creates a \"theology of glory\" where human effort is exalted, rather than a \"theology of the cross\" where human weakness is admitted and divine grace is magnified. According to biblical teaching, salvation is received, not achieved.",

            "Misstated historical condemnations: Pelagianism was primarily condemned by the Council of Carthage (circa 418) and related synods; the claim that the Council of Ephesus condemned Pelagianism is historically inaccurate (Ephesus dealt with Nestorianism and Christological issues).",
            "James 2:24 tension not adequately handled: The response says 'We are saved by faith alone' and 'Saving faith is never alone' in a way that can seem contradictory. James teaches that justification by faith alone is not the full picture; genuine faith is evidenced by works. The treatment could mislead readers about the relationship between faith and works in James and Paul.",
            "Potential ambiguity around 'root vs fruit' terminology: while the root (justification by faith) and fruit (sanctification) distinction is helpful, the explanation could be strengthened with clearer biblical markers (e.g., James 2:14-26; Titus 3:8) to avoid conflating justification with mere moral improvement."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the LLM response aligns with orthodox Protestant-standard teaching: salvation is by grace through faith, not by works; good works flow from genuine faith. The core biblical citations (Eph 2:8-9, Rom 3:20, Gal 2:16, Isa 64:6) are correctly used, and the root-versus-fruit distinction is well-placed. However, a factual inaccuracy about the Ephesus/Carthage condemnations and a nuanced handling of James within the faith-alone discussion reduce precision. A more careful historical note and a more precise articulation of James’s teaching would strengthen doctrinal and biblical precision."
