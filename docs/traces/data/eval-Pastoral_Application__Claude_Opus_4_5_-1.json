    "input": "A person struggling with same-sex attraction asks: 'Can I be a Christian and experience these feelings? Does God hate me?'",
    "expected": "God absolutely does not hate you - He loves you deeply (Romans 5:8). Experiencing same-sex attraction does not disqualify you from being a Christian. Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
    "output": "*Taking a moment to sit with you, giving you my full attention*\n\n---\n\n**First, let me say this clearly: God does not hate you.**\n\nThe very fact that you're asking this question—that you're wrestling with it before God rather than running from Him—reveals a heart that the Spirit is drawing near. That matters profoundly.\n\nLet me address your questions directly and carefully.\n\n---\n\n**Can you be a Christian and experience these feelings?**\n\nYes. Temptation is not sin. Experiencing attraction you did not choose is not the same as acting on it or building your identity around it. Jesus Himself \"was tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin\" (Hebrews 4:15). \n\nMany faithful believers experience unwanted desires of various kinds throughout their entire lives—whether toward anger, greed, pride, or sexual sin of many types. The presence of a struggle does not disqualify you from Christ's family. Paul spoke of a \"thorn in the flesh\" he begged God to remove, and God's answer was: *\"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness\"* (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\n---\n\n**What does Scripture teach about sexuality?**\n\nI want to be honest with you because I respect you: Scripture consistently presents sexual intimacy as designed for the covenant of marriage between husband and wife (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6, Ephesians 5:31-32). Same-sex sexual activity falls outside that design.\n\nBut here's what's equally true: so does heterosexual lust, pornography, sex outside marriage, and adultery. The church has often been hypocritical—treating one sin as uniquely disqualifying while winking at others. That's wrong, and if you've experienced that, I'm sorry.\n\n---\n\n**Does God hate you?**\n\n*He died for you.*\n\n\"God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us\" (Romans 5:8). Not after we cleaned up. Not once we had everything figured out. *While* we were sinners.\n\nYou are not your attractions. You are an image-bearer of God, loved before the foundation of the world, someone for whom Christ bled.\n\n---\n\n**Practically, where do you go from here?**\n\n1. **Stay connected to Christ** — Don't let shame drive you from the One who heals. Come to Him *with* your struggle, not after you've solved it.\n\n2. **Find safe community** — You need brothers or sisters who can know this about you and walk with you without shock or rejection. Isolation is dangerous.\n\n3. **Hold both truths** — God's standards are real, *and* His grace is inexhaustible. Don't abandon either one.\n\n4. **Be patient with mystery** — Some believers experience significant change in their attractions over time; many do not. Faithfulness, not \"success,\" is what God asks. The same is true for the single person who never wanted to be single, or the person who struggles with depression for decades.\n\n---\n\n*\"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.\"* — Jesus (Matthew 11:28)\n\nThat invitation is for you. Right now. As you are.\n\nWould you like to talk more, or pray together?",

          ],
          "rationale": "The response affirms God’s love, correctly distinguishes temptation from sin (Hebrews 4:15; James/Scriptural framework), and maintains the orthodox position that sexual activity is designed for heterosexual marriage (Gen 2:24; Matt 19:4-6; Eph 5:31-32). It rightly cites Romans 5:8 and 2 Corinthians 12:9 to emphasize grace and weakness, and it encourages faithful Christian living, community, and perseverance. It also rightly notes that being a Christian does not require complete eradication of all desires and that believers may experience ongoing struggles. The main gap is a lack of explicit pastoral pathways some traditions emphasize, such as celibacy as a faithful option for those with SSA and a clearer articulation of diverse positions on committed same-sex relationships. These omissions limit the nuance but do not materially undermine core biblical teaching."

It rightly counters the idea that God hates the person, emphasizes that temptation and attraction are not sin, and upholds biblical teaching on sexuality while recognizing the experience of struggle and the need for grace. It demonstrates compassionate pastoral presence, invites dialogue or prayer, and provides practical steps for staying connected to Christ and community. Areas for improvement include a more explicit acknowledgement of the diversity of orthodox positions on same-sex relationships across denominations, greater attention to mental health resources, and clearer guidance on practical, local supports and discernment paths. Overall, it offers a prudent, biblically grounded, and pastorally sensitive response."
