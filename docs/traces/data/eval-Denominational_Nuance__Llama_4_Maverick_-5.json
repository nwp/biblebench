    "input": "How do charismatic/Pentecostal Christians differ from cessationist Christians on spiritual gifts?",
    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",
    "output": "The debate between charismatic/Pentecostal Christians and cessationist Christians centers on the continuation or cessation of spiritual gifts, particularly those gifts associated with the charismatic movement, such as speaking in tongues, prophecy, and healing. Both perspectives are rooted in Scripture and reflect different understandings of biblical teachings on the gifts of the Holy Spirit.\n\n**Charismatic/Pentecostal Perspective:**\n\nCharismatic and Pentecostal Christians believe that the gifts of the Holy Spirit, including those listed in 1 Corinthians 12-14, are still active and available to believers today. They base this conviction on several biblical passages, including:\n\n1. **The promise of Joel 2:28-29**, quoted by Peter in Acts 2:17-18, which prophesies that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, accompanied by spiritual gifts like prophecy and visions, would occur in the last days.\n2. **The experience of the early Church** in Acts, where believers received the Holy Spirit and manifested gifts like speaking in tongues (Acts 2, 10, 19).\n3. **The writings of Paul**, particularly 1 Corinthians 12-14, which describe the various gifts of the Spirit and their role in the Body of Christ.\n\nCharismatic and Pentecostal Christians argue that these gifts are not limited to the apostolic era but are meant to continue throughout the Church age, empowering believers for ministry and witness. They emphasize the importance of experiencing the baptism of the Holy Spirit, which is often associated with the manifestation of spiritual gifts.\n\n**Cessationist Perspective:**\n\nCessationist Christians, on the other hand, believe that certain spiritual gifts, particularly those associated with the apostolic era, such as apostleship, prophecy, and miracles, have ceased or are no longer normative for the Church today. They argue that these gifts were:\n\n1. **Temporary and foundational**, serving to authenticate the apostles and establish the Church (Ephesians 2:20, Hebrews 2:3-4).\n2. **Limited to the apostolic era**, as the completion of the canon of Scripture rendered some gifts, like prophecy and apostleship, unnecessary (1 Corinthians 13:8-10).\n3. **Not normative for all believers**, as the gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12-14 were not universally exercised or expected (1 Corinthians 12:29-30).\n\nCessationists often emphasize the sufficiency of Scripture for all aspects of Christian life and ministry, suggesting that the continuation of extraordinary gifts might undermine the authority of the written Word.\n\n**Key differences and areas of agreement:**\n\nWhile charismatic/Pentecostal and cessationist Christians differ on the continuation of certain spiritual gifts, they share a commitment to the authority of Scripture and the importance of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer. Both perspectives acknowledge that the Spirit's gifts are given for the edification of the Church (1 Corinthians 12:7, Ephesians 4:12).\n\nThe main differences lie in their understanding of the purpose and duration of spiritual gifts, as well as their interpretation of relevant biblical passages. Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians tend to emphasize the ongoing role of the Spirit's gifts in empowering believers for ministry and witness, while cessationists focus on the sufficiency of Scripture and the completed canon.\n\n**Diversity within traditions:**\n\nIt's essential to recognize that both charismatic/Pentecostal and cessationist perspectives encompass a range of views within their respective traditions. Some charismatic and Pentecostal Christians may hold more extreme or nuanced views on the gifts, while cessationists may disagree on which specific gifts have ceased or the extent to which they are no longer normative.\n\n**Core orthodox beliefs:**\n\nDespite these differences, both charismatic/Pentecostal and cessationist Christians affirm core orthodox beliefs, such as:\n\n1. **The authority of Scripture** as the inspired Word of God.\n2. **The Trinity**, including the deity and personality of the Holy Spirit.\n3. **The importance of the Holy Spirit** in the life of the believer and the Church.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate between charismatic/Pentecostal and cessationist Christians on spiritual gifts reflects different understandings of biblical teachings and the role of the Holy Spirit in the Church. While they differ on the continuation of certain gifts, they share a commitment to the authority of Scripture and the importance of the Spirit's work in the life of believers. By engaging in respectful dialogue and acknowledging the legitimacy of diverse perspectives, Christians from various traditions can foster a deeper understanding of the complex issues involved and promote unity in the Body of Christ.",

It acknowledges diversity within camps and preserves core orthodoxy (Scripture, Trinity, Spirit). Some nuances are simplified or omitted (the referent of 'the perfect' in 1 Cor 13:8–10, distinctions within prophecy, and the spectrum of cessationist views on ongoing miraculous activity), which is why the score is high but not perfect."

It does not privilege a specific denomination, avoids polemics, and ends with a call for respectful dialogue. A minor limitation is its focus on Protestant streams and lack of explicit engagement with Catholic or Orthodox perspectives on charismatic gifts, which slightly narrows ecumenical scope but does not indicate bias toward them."
