    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",
    "output": "In the landscape of Christian theology, the debate over the \"extraordinary\" or \"sign\" gifts of the Holy Spirit (such as tongues, prophecy, and healing) represents one of the most significant points of practical and doctrinal divergence. This discussion generally pits **Continuationism** (often represented by Pentecostals and charismatics) against **Cessationism** (often represented by Reformed and some Baptist traditions).\n\nHere is an overview of how these traditions differ, reflecting their respective biblical interpretations and theological priorities.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Core Question: Duration and Purpose\nThe fundamental disagreement lies in whether certain spiritual gifts were intended only for the establishment of the early Church or if they are meant to be a permanent feature of Christian life until the return of Christ.\n\n*   **The Cessationist Perspective:** Cessationists believe that the \"miraculous\" gifts (prophecy, tongues, and apostolic healing) ceased after the death of the last Apostle and the completion of the New Testament canon. They argue these gifts served a specific \"sign\" purpose: to authenticate the Apostles as true messengers of God before the written Word was available. Once the Bible was complete, the \"perfect\" had come (often citing 1 Corinthians 13:8–10), and the miraculous signs were no longer necessary.\n*   **The Pentecostal/Charismatic Perspective:** Continuationists believe that all spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are still available to the Church today. They argue that the \"perfect\" mentioned in 1 Corinthians 13 refers to the return of Christ or the eternal state, not the completion of the Bible. Therefore, as long as the Church is in the \"in-between\" time, it requires the empowering presence of the Holy Spirit through all His gifts for mission and edification.\n\n### 2. The Nature of Revelation and Scripture\nBoth sides generally affirm the **Sufficiency of Scripture** (the Bible is the final authority), but they apply it differently regarding modern spiritual experiences.\n\n*   **Cessationists:** They emphasize that the canon of Scripture is closed. They worry that modern \"prophecies\" or \"words from God\" inherently threaten the finality of the Bible. If God is still speaking through prophets, they argue, then the Bible is effectively \"incomplete.\" Therefore, they view modern claims of prophecy as either psychological phenomena or a misunderstanding of \"preaching.\"\n*   **Pentecostals/Charismatics:** They distinguish between *capital-R* Revelation (the Bible, which is infallible and closed) and *small-r* revelation (a spontaneous prompting or insight from the Spirit for a specific person or situation). They believe the Spirit helps apply the Word to the present moment without adding new doctrine. For them, \"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says,\" is an ongoing command.\n\n### 3. The \"Baptism in the Holy Spirit\"\nA distinct feature of classical Pentecostalism is the doctrine of a \"second blessing.\"\n\n*   **Pentecostals:** Most classical Pentecostals believe that after conversion, there is a subsequent experience called the \"Baptism in the Holy Spirit,\" which provides power for witnessing. They usually view speaking in tongues (glossolalia) as the \"initial physical evidence\" of this baptism. (While \"Charismatics\" share the belief in the gifts, they may not always insist on tongues as the exclusive evidence or as a separate event from salvation).\n*   **Cessationists:** They typically believe that every believer is \"baptized by the Spirit\" into the Body of Christ at the moment of conversion (1 Corinthians 12:13). They reject the idea of a two-stage Christian experience and view the instances of tongues in the Book of Acts as unique historical markers transitionally linking different groups (Jews, Samaritans, Gentiles) to the one Church.\n\n### 4. Interpretation of History\nBoth traditions look at Church history to validate their claims.\n\n*   **Cessationists:** Note that shortly after the Apostolic Age, reports of the sign gifts largely disappeared from the writings of the Church Fathers (like Chrysostom and Augustine). They see the 1,900-year \"silence\" of these gifts as evidence of their cessation.\n*   **Pentecostals/Charismatics:** Argue that the gifts never fully disappeared but were marginalized by the institutionalization and \"quenching\" of the Spirit in the Church. They point to various revival movements throughout history and the global explosion of Pentecostalism in the 20th century as a \"Latter Rain\"—a restoration of New Testament power for the final harvest.\n\n### 5. Practical Application: Order vs. Power\n*   **Cessationists** prioritize **order** and the \"ordinary means of grace\" (preaching, the sacraments/ordinances, and prayer). They believe God's power is most evident in the supernatural transformation of a sinner’s heart rather than in physical miracles.\n*   **Pentecostals/Charismatics** prioritize **expectancy** and the \"extraordinary means of grace.\" They believe a church service should be open to spontaneous moves of the Spirit, expecting that God will manifest His presence through healing or prophetic encouragement during the gathering.\n\n### Common Ground\nDespite these stark differences, it is important to note where they agree:\n1.  **The Sovereignty of God:** Both believe God *can* heal or perform miracles today if He chooses; the debate is over whether He does so through *gifted individuals* (healers/prophets).\n2.  **The Divinity of the Spirit:** Both affirm the Holy Spirit as the third person of the Trinity, essential for sanctification and understanding the Bible.\n3.  **The Authority of the Bible:** Both claim to derive their positions from a high view of the New Testament, simply differing on the interpretation of its \"shelf life.\"\n\nIn summary, Cessationists seek to protect the **finality and sufficiency of the Word**, while Continuationists seek to maintain the **availability and vitality of the Spirit’s power**. Both see themselves as faithful to the New Testament's vision of the Christian life.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately presents the core Continuationist vs. Cessationist debate: cessationists typically argue sign gifts ceased after the apostolic era with the close of the canon (often citing 1 Corinthians 13:8–10 and the historical ‘silent period’), while continuationists affirm ongoing gifts (tongues, prophecy, healing) for the church age. It correctly notes the Pentecostal emphasis on a second experiential work (Baptism in the Holy Spirit) with tongues as initial evidence, and it acknowledges variation among Charismatics who may not require tongues as the sole or initial evidence. It also covers common grounds (Sovereign Spirit, authority of Scripture, belief in active Spirit today) and contrasts practical emphases (order vs. power). The piece cites relevant biblical themes (1 Corinthians 13, the Spirit’s guidance, Acts’ historical gift patterns) and discusses history and revivalist arguments. Nuance gaps are modest: it could more explicitly acknowledge significant intra-group variations (e.g., within cessationist views on whether prophecies or non-canonical revelations can occur, and within continuationists about the exact evidential role of tongues). It also frames the cessationist position in a fairly traditional form without detailing divergent interpretations of “the perfect” (Bible vs. Christ’s return) that exist among scholars. Overall, the answer is doctrinally orthodox and biblically informed, with a well-balanced treatment of major differences and common ground."

          "explanation": "The response fairly presents both continuationist and cessationist perspectives and notes common ground, which supports balance. However, it frames the debate primarily in Protestant terms (Pentecostal/charismatic vs. Reformed/Baptist) and omits broader ecumenical perspectives (e.g., Catholic and Orthodox views and more diverse Anglican/Methodist positions). This creates a Protestant-centric framing with a mild tilt toward the common Pentecostal/charismatic emphasis, resulting in slight bias. Overall ecumenical treatment is good but not fully comprehensive."
