        "output": "This is a question where Christians hold different views based on how they interpret Scripture and understand church tradition.\n\n**Those who say yes** point to:\n- Galatians 3:28 (\"neither male nor female... all one in Christ\")\n- Examples of women leaders in Scripture (Deborah, Priscilla, Phoebe, Junia)\n- The view that restrictive passages were addressing specific cultural situations\n- Many denominations (Methodist, Presbyterian USA, Episcopal, many Baptist churches, etc.) ordain women\n\n**Those who say no** point to:\n- 1 Timothy 2:12 and 1 Corinthians 14:34-35\n- The pattern of male apostles and elders in the New Testament\n- Complementarian theology viewing distinct roles as part of God's design\n- Traditional practice in Catholic, Orthodox, and many evangelical churches\n\n**The divide** generally falls between:\n- **Egalitarians**: Men and women can hold any church office\n- **Complementarians**: Certain leadership roles are reserved for men\n\nThis remains one of the more debated issues in Christianity, with sincere believers on both sides studying the same texts and reaching different conclusions. Denominations, individual churches, and believers continue to work through this question based on their understanding of Scripture, tradition, and the Holy Spirit's leading.\n\nIs there a particular aspect of this question you'd like to explore further?",
