    "expected": "Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both biblical truths held in tension. God is completely sovereign over all things, yet humans are genuine moral agents responsible for their choices. Scripture teaches both that God ordains all things and that humans make real choices for which they are accountable. Different theological traditions emphasize these aspects differently (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), but orthodox Christianity affirms both truths without fully resolving the mystery of how they relate.",
    "output": "**The relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility**\n\n| **Issue** | **What it asks** | **Biblical grounding** |\n|-----------|------------------|------------------------|\n| **Divine Sovereignty** | The total, unalterable control that God has over all things—creation, history, and the moral order. | Psalm 10:16 “*He is wise in understanding; does what he wants*”; Jeremiah 23:29 “*It is merely the act of a human*”; Isaiah 45:23 “*I have told you, and will do that or that you will obey*”; Colossians 1:16‑17 “*All was created by Him, and through Him*”; 2 Peter 3:9 “*The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise*. |\n| **Human Responsibility** | The moral agency given to us—obligation to obey, to choose rightly, to steward creation, and to repay judgment. | Deuteronomy 30:19 “*I put before you the living and the dead*”; Romans 13:1‑7 “*You must obey the government as God’s appointed authority*”; Acts 17:27 “*God commanded the soul to be mortal, to work in obedience*”; 1 Thessalonians 5:6 “*Look’th; the day is near*”. |\n\n---\n\n### 1. What divine sovereignty means\n\n* **Omnipotence & Omniscience** – God is *all‑powerful* and *knows all things* (Genesis 1:1; Psalm 147:5).  \n* **Providence** – He *directs all events* to accomplish His purposes (Ephesians 1:11; Romans 8:28).  \n* **Primacy of God’s will** – God initiates, sustains, and concludes every act (Jeremiah 10:5); the king’s will is law to the people (Psalm 18:30).  \n\n### 2. What human responsibility means\n\n* **Free will** – God has created “free in human decision” (Jeremiah 1:5).  \n* **Obedience to law** – The law of God is a *call* for moral behaviour (Galatians 5:6).  \n* **Garmer: “Covenantal Accountability”** – Humanity is accountable to God for its choices (Hebrews 9:28).  \n\n### 3. Why sovereignty and responsibility coexist\n\n**(a) Historical theology (Augustine & Aquinas)**  \n\n  * **Augustine** (III‑IV C): God foretells events *without negating man’s freedom*; the moral order is preserved because man’s *good will* is produced by the gift of the divine Word (2 Peter 3:17).  \n  * **Aquinas** (13‑14 C): “Being created  and destined to *act*,” man *acts by the grace of God and his own inclination*; thus, divine sovereignty *does not undermine* self‑generated morality (Summa Dei 3.1.2).\n\n**(b) The “compatibilist” view** – “God’s sovereignty & human freedom are compatible.”  \n  * **Philippians 2:12‑13** – “Work therefore out your salvation *with fear and trembling* because *God has** you* if we act *freely* yet under His grace.  \n  * The *causal chain* is: God **creates** → man *acts* (free) → God **resolves**.  \n\n### 4. How they function together\n\n1. **God’s sovereignty provides the framework** – all content, choices, outcomes are within the sovereign plan.  \n2. **Human responsibility implements the plan** – the moral “actors” (men and women) perform choices required by the plan.  \n3. **Accountability exists because sovereignty exists** – the same God who *orders* events gives us moral agency; otherwise justice would be impossible.  \n\nThink of the celestial “corsage” that turns the spinning world: God commands it; we are the hands that move perfectly, responsive to the music.  \n\n### 5. Biblical examples that illustrate the balance\n\n| **Biblical case** | **Sovereignty** | **Responsibility** |\n|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| **The fall** (Genesis 3) | God *created* the tree and *sent* the serpent | Adam and Eve *choose* to disobey. |\n| **The call of Abraham** (Genesis 12) | God *masters the covenant* | Abraham *has faith* and *obeys* when commanded to move, sacrifice. |\n| **The death of Christ** (John 3:16‑24) | God *plans salvation* | Jesus *voluntarily* gives Himself up in obedience. |\n| **The life of the Church** (Acts 1:24‑26) | Peter’s plans *maintain unity* “the choice for a shepherd” | The Gentiles *choose* or *reject* - they *live* in faith or unbelief. |\n\n### 6. Practical implications for believers\n\n* **Freedom does not free us from accountability** – a saved person remains responsible for sin and for obeying Scripture.\n* **Sovereignty reassures** – the same God that loves us also *will* deliver our obligations, not a capricious deity.\n* **Mission delivers** – we have the agency to *share the gospel*: empowered by God, we are the *operatives* of the sovereign plan.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nDivine sovereignty declares that God *wins* and *wields* every cause in creation.  \nHuman responsibility declares that God *grants* us *choice and moral accountability*.  \n\nThe interaction is:  \n*God’s sovereign plan includes the possibility for human choice;  \nour free choices, informed by God’s word, move the plan into reality.*  \n\nThe biblical picture is cooperative: *God* orders, *humans* act. Both ends are equally required for the logical, moral, and salvific architecture of Scripture.  This is the faithful, biblically grounded understanding of how divine sovereignty and human responsibility are interrelated.",

          "rationale": "The response attempts to address divine sovereignty and human responsibility with historical options (Augustine, Aquinas, compatibilism) and practical implications. However, the core biblical grounding is seriously flawed due to misquotations, misattributions, and incorrect verse references. This undermines doctrinal accuracy and scriptural reliability, which are essential for a trustworthy evaluation of sovereignty and responsibility. While the outline shows awareness of nuanced positions, the inaccuracies in scripture and in classical references prevent the answer from being considered doctrinally sound or biblically grounded. A corrected version would need precise, accurately cited scriptures, careful formulation of Augustine/Aquinas/compatibilist positions, and a clear articulation of how various orthodox traditions articulate the balance between sovereignty and responsibility without misusing or misquoting Scripture."

          "explanation": "The response does not advocate or teach any of the listed classical heresies (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, etc.). It presents an orthodox compatibilist view: divine sovereignty and human responsibility can coexist, with God ordaining and guiding all things while humans make genuine choices. However, the submission contains numerous biblical quotation and attribution inaccuracies (misquoting or misapplying verses such as Psalm 10:16, Jeremiah 23:29, Isaiah 45:23, Acts 17:27, 1 Thessalonians 5:6, etc.; incorrect or unclear references like “Summa Dei” and misattributing Aquinas/Autinian positions). These textual errors undermine clarity and doctrinal precision, though they do not constitute a heresy in themselves. The core theological stance remains within historic orthodoxy (Augustine, Aquinas, and a compatibilist stance) rather than any of the listed heresies. Potential risk is more about accuracy of Scripture citations and proper exegesis than about endorsing false doctrine."
