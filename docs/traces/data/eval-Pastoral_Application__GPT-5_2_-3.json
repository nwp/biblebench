    "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
    "output": "I am so sorry. The death of a child is a wound that doesn’t “make sense” in any normal way, and I don’t want to offer you slogans when what you’re carrying is heartbreak. If you want to weep, be angry, sit in silence, or ask hard questions—those are not signs of weak faith. They are the language of love and loss.\n\n### 1) It’s okay to reject shallow answers\nWhen people say, “It’s God’s will” or “Everything happens for a reason,” they often mean well, but those phrases can land like a burden: as if God personally chose this pain for you and your child. Scripture doesn’t talk to the grieving with clichés. It gives us permission to lament.\n\n- Jesus wept at a grave, even knowing resurrection was coming (John 11:35).\n- The Psalms are full of “Why, O Lord?” (Psalm 13; Psalm 22).\n- God does not scold His children for bringing Him honest grief.\n\n### 2) God’s love and a broken world: holding two truths together\nThe Bible teaches two things at the same time:\n\n**A) God is truly loving and good.**  \nGod’s heart is not cold or distant toward your suffering. “The LORD is near to the brokenhearted” (Psalm 34:18). He is “compassionate and gracious” (Psalm 103:8). In Jesus, God enters suffering rather than watching from afar (Isaiah 53:3–4).\n\n**B) Death is an enemy, not a “good plan.”**  \nDeath is not presented as a beautiful, intended feature of God’s creation. It is called “the last enemy” (1 Corinthians 15:26). Our world is fallen—marked by sin, fragility, and tragedy (Romans 8:20–22). Car accidents, disease, and sudden losses are part of that brokenness. That doesn’t make God absent; it means we live in a world that is not yet what God will finally make it.\n\nSo when you ask, “How can a loving God will my child’s death?”—one faithful way to say it is: **God does not delight in death.** Scripture says He takes “no pleasure in the death” of people (Ezekiel 18:32), and He is not cruel. What happened is a real tragedy in a real broken world.\n\n### 3) God’s sovereignty isn’t the same as God’s desire\nChristians often struggle to speak carefully here. The Bible does say God is sovereign—nothing is outside His knowledge or ultimate authority (Psalm 115:3; Matthew 10:29). But it also shows that not everything that happens reflects God’s moral will or His heart’s desire.\n\n- God can **permit** what He **hates**, and still promise to ultimately defeat it.\n- God can bring good **out of** evil and tragedy without calling the tragedy “good.”\n\nOne of the clearest examples is the cross: human beings meant it for evil, and yet God used it for salvation (Acts 2:23; Acts 4:27–28; Genesis 50:20 shows a similar pattern). That doesn’t mean the evil was “good”; it means God is not powerless against evil.\n\nSo I would be careful telling you, “God willed your child’s death” as though God delighted in it or authored it as a preferred outcome. **What I can say is: God saw it, God was not absent, and God is able—mysteriously and faithfully—to hold you, redeem what can be redeemed, and one day end death itself.**\n\n### 4) What God gives you right now is Himself, not an explanation\nIn deep grief, “reasons” can feel like salt in the wound. In Job’s suffering, God does not give Job a neat explanation; He gives Job His presence and His greatness (Job 38–42). And Job is allowed to pour out raw grief along the way.\n\nYou may not get an answer to “Why?” that satisfies your heart in this life. But you are not being asked to pretend it doesn’t hurt. You are invited to bring the hurt to the One who can hold it.\n\n- “Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.” (1 Peter 5:7)\n- “God is our refuge and strength…a very present help in trouble.” (Psalm 46:1)\n\n### 5) Jesus understands a parent’s grief\nGod is not unfamiliar with the loss of a beloved Son. The Father knows what it is to give His Son and watch Him die (John 3:16; Romans 8:32). That doesn’t erase your pain, but it does mean you are not alone in it. Christianity doesn’t offer a God who explains suffering from a distance; it offers a God who suffers with us and for us.\n\n### 6) What about your child—can you have hope?\nMany grieving parents carry an additional fear: “Where is my child now?” While Scripture doesn’t answer every question with the detail we might want, it does reveal God’s character: He is just, merciful, and good. We know He welcomes those who come to Him, and we know He does what is right (Genesis 18:25). We entrust our loved ones to Him.\n\nAnd we do have a sure hope: because Christ rose, death does not get the final word. There will be a day when God wipes away every tear (Revelation 21:4). That promise is not a bandage; it is a future that can hold you when the present feels unbearable.\n\n### 7) Practical steps for the coming days\nHere are a few gentle, concrete things that often help:\n\n1. **Give yourself permission to grieve in waves.** Grief is not linear. Some days will feel numb, some angry, some crushing, some strangely normal—and that’s not betrayal; it’s human.\n2. **Pray honestly.** If all you can say is, “God, I can’t,” that is a prayer. The Psalms can lend you words when yours are gone (Psalm 13; 22; 42).\n3. **Let others carry you.** Accept meals, rides, help with paperwork, childcare, whatever is offered. You’re not meant to do this alone (Galatians 6:2).\n4. **Seek wise support.** A grief counselor or support group can be a gift alongside pastoral care. If sleep, panic, or intrusive images become overwhelming, that is not weakness—get help.\n5. **Set boundaries with unhelpful comments.** It’s okay to say, “I know you mean well, but that doesn’t help me right now. I just need you to grieve with me.”\n\n### 8) If I could say one sentence to hold onto\nGod did not stop loving you when this happened. He is not asking you to call this good. He is asking you to bring Him your broken heart—and He promises to be near.\n\nIf you’re willing, I’d like to ask two questions so I can care for you more personally:\n1) How have the nights been—are you sleeping at all?  \n2) What do you most need from God and from people this week: answers, presence, help with practical things, or simply space to grieve?",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response is largely aligned with orthodox Christian teaching. It distinguishes God’s sovereign control from His moral will (God permits/suffers with us, rather than delights in tragedy), affirms that death is a consequence of living in a fallen world, and asserts that God does not take pleasure in death. It grounds its claims in Scripture (lament in John 11:35; Psalms of lament; God near to the brokenhearted in Psalm 34:18; comfort for the mourners in Matthew 5:4; ultimate defeat of death in 1 Corinthians 15:26; Romans 8:28; the cross pattern in Acts and Genesis 50:20; the resurrection hope in Revelation 21:4). It communicates a balanced, pastorally sensitive view: God understands suffering, is with the grieving, and can bring good from evil without calling the tragedy “good.” It reinforces the distinction between asking for an explanation and receiving God’s presence (Job 38–42), and it provides practical steps for grief. Nuance is present in its discussion of lament, divine sovereignty versus God’s desired will, and the hope of redemption and future reversal of death. Minor caveat: the answer does not explicitly cite Romans 5:12 to attribute death to sin, though it references the fallen world and Romans 8:20–22; this is not a doctrinal error but a potential enhancement for completeness. Overall, the response is theologically accurate, doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."
