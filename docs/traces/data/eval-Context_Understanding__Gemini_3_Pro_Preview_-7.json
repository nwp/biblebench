    "input": "Why did Jesus use parables in his teaching?",
    "expected": "Jesus used parables to reveal truth to those with receptive hearts while concealing it from those who rejected him, and to make spiritual truths memorable through everyday stories",
    "output": "Based on the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) and the historical context of First-Century Jewish pedagogy, Jesus’ use of parables served multiple functions ranging from practical communication to theological judgment.\n\nScholars generally categorize the reasons for his use of parables into three distinct areas: the explicit scriptural purpose regarding \"insiders and outsiders,\" practical educational strategy, and the subversion of cultural expectations.\n\n### 1. The Explicit Scriptural Purpose: Revealing and Concealing\nWhen the disciples explicitly asked Jesus, \"Why do you speak to them in parables?\" (Matthew 13:10), his answer was theological rather than merely practical.\n\n*   **To Reveal to the Receptive:** For those who had repented and were following him (\"insiders\"), parables provided a way to visualize the \"secrets of the kingdom of heaven.\" They illuminated complex spiritual realities through concrete imagery.\n*   **To Conceal from the Hard-hearted:** Jesus quoted Isaiah 6:9–10, explaining that parables served a judicial function. For those who were spiritually dull or hostile (\"outsiders\"), the parable remained a riddle without a solution. This prevented superficial understanding and served as a form of judgment on those who refused to accept his clear proclamation of the Kingdom.\n\nScholars often note that this created a sifting process: the parable invited the true seeker to come closer to ask for the meaning (as the disciples did), while the disinterested listener would walk away with nothing but a confusing story.\n\n### 2. Pedagogical Strategy in an Oral Culture\nFrom a historical and literary perspective, the parable (*parabolē* in Greek; *mashal* in Hebrew) was a brilliant tool for a predominantly oral society.\n\n*   **Mnemonics (Memory Aid):** In a culture where writing was rare and expensive, teaching had to be memorable. Abstract theology is difficult to memorize, but a narrative about a Good Samaritan or a Prodigal Son sticks in the mind. The vivid imagery (sowing seeds, lighting lamps, building towers) allowed the teaching to be retained and passed down accurately.\n*   **Relatability:** Jesus drew from the everyday life of the Galilean peasantry—farming, fishing, financing, and weddings. This grounded his theology in the physical reality of his audience, making the \"Kingdom of God\" feel imminent and real rather than distant and philosophical.\n\n### 3. Subversion and Disarming the Listener\nOne of the most powerful functions of the parable was its ability to bypass a listener’s mental defenses. This is a tactic famously used in the Old Testament by the prophet Nathan to convict King David (2 Samuel 12).\n\n*   **Bypassing Prejudice:** If Jesus had bluntly stated, \"You religious leaders are neglecting justice,\" the Pharisees likely would have shouted him down immediately. By telling a story about a vineyard owner and wicked tenants, he drew them into the narrative first. By the time they understood the point, they had already condemned themselves by the logic of the story.\n*   **Forcing Active Engagement:** Parables are not passive lectures; they require the listener to make a judgment. They often end with questions or imply a choice (e.g., \"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor?\"). This forced the listener to think critically and position themselves deeply within the moral framework Jesus was presenting.\n\n### Historical Context: The *Mashal*\nIt is important to note that Jesus did not invent the parable. He was operating within the Jewish tradition of the *mashal*, a broad term covering proverbs, riddles, and allegories. Rabbinic literature is filled with parables used to explain the Torah (Law).\n\nHowever, a key distinction noted by scholars is that while Rabbis used parables to clarify existing Scripture, Jesus largely used parables to proclaim **new revelation** regarding the arrival of God's Kingdom. He used a familiar Jewish form to introduce a radically new reality.",

          "rationale": "The answer accurately summarizes the main scholarly points about why Jesus used parables: (1) the insider/outsider dynamic drawn from Matthew 13 and the Isaiah 6:9–10 quotation, (2) the pedagogical function in an oral, memory-oriented culture with relatable, concrete imagery, and (3) a subversive or engaging function that invites active interpretation while challenging resistant listeners. It situates Jesus within the Mashal (parabolic) tradition and contrasts his use with Rabbinic uses, noting that Jesus often proclaimed new revelation about the Kingdom. It cites key biblical references and recognizable examples (Good Samaritan, Prodigal Son) and acknowledges the interpretive framework that parables serve to reveal truth to the receptive and conceal it from the closed. Minor caveats that could be expanded (e.g., more nuance on how insiders understand vs. misunderstandings even among disciples) do not materially affect overall accuracy or relevance.} } } The outer braces appear malformed?
