          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns with biblical teaching: Jesus uses parables to reveal the truth of the Kingdom of God to receptive listeners and to conceal it from those with hardened hearts, a dynamic explicitly echoed in the Gospel narratives (e.g., Matthew 13:10-17; Isaiah 6:9-10 as cited in Matthew 13:14-15). It also mirrors the explanatory link to Isaiah and notes the use of familiar, memorable imagery to convey spiritual truths. The statement is consistent with historic Christian orthodoxy and supported by Scripture. The nuance—recognizing both revelation to the receptive and concealment to the resistant, plus the use of everyday imagery—is adequately captured. No clear theological errors are present."
