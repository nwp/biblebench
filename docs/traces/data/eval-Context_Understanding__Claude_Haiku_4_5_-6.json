            "The claim that 'Kings does not depend on Chronicles' is broadly accurate but oversimplifies: most scholars agree Chronicles draws on Kings (and other sources) as one of its inputs; the degree of independence is a debated point between scholars."

          "rationale": "The response accurately describes the overarching relationship: Chronicles retells much of Kings but with a priestly/temple emphasis and a focus on Davidic lineage; it notes that Chronicles used Kings as a source and that the two works reflect different audiences and purposes, and it cites the common scholarly view that they are complementary yet independent traditions. Some nuances—specifically Chronicles’ emphasis on Judah (not the Northern Kingdom) and the precise nature of source dependence—are not fully spelled out, constituting minor omissions rather than factual errors."
