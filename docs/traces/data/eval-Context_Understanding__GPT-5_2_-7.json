          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns well with biblical teaching: parables reveal truths about the kingdom to listeners with receptive hearts and function as a judgement or concealment for those who reject or are hardened, which echoes Jesus’ use of parables in Matthew 13:10–17; Mark 4:10–12; Luke 8:9–10. It correctly notes that parables are memorable, concrete stories that lead to repentance and faith, and that their purpose includes identifying true disciples versus the broader crowd. The statement about fulfilling Isaiah’s prophecy corresponds to the Gospel’s explanation (Isaiah 6:9–10 as cited in the synoptic Gospels). The response cites the right passages and maintains consistency with historic orthodoxy about revelation to insiders and concealment to outsiders. A minor nuance not fully explicit is that some aspects of how parables reveal or conceal truth can vary by context and audience, but the overall assessment is accurate and well-grounded in Scripture."
