    "input": "A preacher claims: 'Salvation is achieved through good works and moral living. If you live a good life, you will earn your way to heaven.' Is this biblical teaching?",
    "expected": "This is heretical Pelagianism or works-righteousness. Orthodox Christianity teaches salvation by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works are important as evidence and fruit of genuine faith, they cannot earn salvation. Salvation is a free gift of God's grace, received through faith in Christ's finished work, not merited by human effort.",
    "output": "As a theologian analyzing this statement through the lens of historical orthodoxy and biblical doctrine, the claim that salvation is achieved through good works and moral living is classified as a **heresy**.\n\nIn church history and systematic theology, this specific teaching is known as **Pelagianism** (and its derivative, **Semi-Pelagiansm**), both of which were formally condemned by the early Church.\n\nHere is an analysis of why this statement is considered heterodox (unorthodox) and how it contradicts established Christian doctrine.\n\n### 1. The Theological Classification: Pelagianism\nThe claim that one can \"earn your way to heaven\" originated in the 4th and 5th centuries with a monk named **Pelagius**. He argued that human nature was not fundamentally corrupted by the Fall of Adam and that humans possessed the innate moral capacity to choose God and live holy lives without the internal assistance of divine grace.\n\nThe Church decisively rejected this view at the **Council of Ephesus (431 AD)** and the **Council of Orange (529 AD)**. The Church Fathers, led most notably by **St. Augustine of Hippo**, argued that such a view renders the sacrifice of Jesus Christ unnecessary. If humanity could save itself through moral effort, Christ died for nothing (Galatians 2:21).\n\n### 2. Biblical Contradiction: Grace vs. Merit\nThe preacher’s statement contradicts the core New Testament teaching that salvation is a gift of God's grace (*sola gratia*) received through faith (*sola fide*).\n\n*   **Ephesians 2:8–9:** \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—**not by works**, so that no one can boast.\"\n*   **Titus 3:5:** \"He saved us, **not because of righteous things we had done**, but because of his mercy.\"\n*   **Romans 3:20:** \"Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.\"\n\nFrom a biblical standpoint, the \"standard\" for heaven is perfection (Matthew 5:48). Because all have sinned (Romans 3:23), moral living is insufficient to bridge the gap between a holy God and fallen humanity. Salvation, therefore, must be an act of divine rescue, not a wage earned by human labor.\n\n### 3. The Role of Works in Orthodoxy\nTo provide a complete theological analysis, we must distinguish between *the cause* of salvation and *the evidence* of salvation. \n\nOrthodox Christian teaching (across Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions) does not dismiss good works; rather, it recontextualizes them:\n*   **In Pelagianism:** Works are the *cause* of salvation. (Heresy)\n*   **In Orthodoxy:** Works are the *fruit* or *result* of salvation.\n\nAs the Reformer John Calvin famously put it: *\"It is faith alone which justifies, and yet the faith which justifies is not alone.\"* Similarly, James 2:17 states that \"faith without works is dead.\" This does not mean works *save* us, but rather that a person who is truly saved by grace will naturally demonstrate that transformation through a changed, moral life.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe preacher's claim is **heretical**. It replaces the Gospel of Grace with a system of **legalism** or **moralism**. By suggesting that heaven is earned, the statement denies the necessity of the Atonement, contradicts the clear teaching of the New Testament, and ignores the foundational Christian doctrine of Original Sin and human depravity.",

          "rationale": "The response correctly identifies the core biblical concern (salvation by grace through faith, with works as evidence) and argues against a works-based soteriology. It correctly appeals to key verses and the distinction between basis and fruit of salvation. However, it contains a historiographical inaccuracy about the Council of Ephesus and somewhat broad generalizations about Catholic/Orthodox/Protestant positions on justification. It also presents a strong claim about the Atonement that is historically nuanced. Overall, the assessment is solid and doctrinally sound, but could be improved with more precise historical details and careful phrasing on Catholic/Orthodox soteriology. "
