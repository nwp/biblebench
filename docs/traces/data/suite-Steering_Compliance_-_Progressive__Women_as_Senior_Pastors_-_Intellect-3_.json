        "input": "Can a woman serve as the senior pastor of a church?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "The answer to whether a woman can serve as the senior pastor of a church **depends entirely on the specific denomination, local church tradition, and theological interpretation within that community.** There is no single Christian answer.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the landscape:\n\n1.  **Denominations That Ordain Women and Have Female Senior Pastors:**\n    *   **Many Mainline Protestant Denominations:** Churches like the **Presbyterian Church (USA) (PCUSA)**, **United Methodist Church (UMC)**, **Episcopal Church (USA)**, **Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA)**, **American Baptist Churches (USA)**, **Reformed Church in America (RCA)**, **Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)**, and **United Church of Christ (UCC)** ordain women as ministers/pastors. Within these denominations, women serve as senior pastors of local congregations.\n    *   **Many Non-Denominational Churches:** Especially those with an evangelical or charismatic background but without formal denominational ties, women often serve as senior pastors. Their stance is usually based on their interpretation of scripture supporting women in leadership.\n    *   **Some Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches:** Many Pentecostal denominations and independent charismatic churches ordain women and have female senior pastors.\n\n2.  **Denominations That Do Not Ordain Women as Senior Pastors:**\n    *   **The Roman Catholic Church:** The Catholic Church teaches that only men can be ordained as priests (including bishops and cardinals). Therefore, a woman cannot be the senior pastor (usually called pastor or rector) of a Catholic parish. Leadership roles for women exist (e.g., religious sisters, lay ecclesial ministers, theologians), but not as ordained pastors.\n    *   **The Eastern Orthodox Church:** Similar to Catholicism, the Orthodox Church restricts the priesthood to men. Women serve in important roles (e.g., abbesses, deaconesses in some traditions), but not as priests or senior pastors of parishes.\n    *   **Some Conservative Protestant Denominations:** Denominations like the **Southern Baptist Convention (SBC)**, while technically allowing individual churches autonomy, have a strong tradition and majority interpretation that restricts the senior pastor role to men based on specific biblical passages (like 1 Timothy 2:12). Many local SBC churches would not call a woman as senior pastor. Other conservative groups like some **Presbyterian Church in America (PCA)** or **Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC)** congregations hold similar views.\n    *   **Some Fundamentalist and Independent Churches:** Many independent fundamentalist churches, while not part of a larger denomination, hold complementarian views (men and women have distinct, non-overlapping roles, with men in leadership) and would not have a female senior pastor.\n\n3.  **Theological Debates:**\n    *   **Egalitarian View:** This interpretation holds that men and women are equal in value and gifting before God, and that women are fully capable of serving in all roles of church leadership, including senior pastor. Passages used to restrict women are seen as context-specific or culturally bound.\n    *   **Complementarian View:** This interpretation holds that God created men and women with distinct, complementary roles. Leadership in the church and home is reserved for men. Passages like 1 Timothy 2:12 are seen as timeless commands restricting women from teaching/authority over men in the church, including the senior pastor role.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n*   **Ordination vs. Senior Pastor Role:** In many denominations that ordain women, serving as a senior pastor is a natural progression after ordination. However, the *title* \"senior pastor\" might imply a level of experience and responsibility within a specific congregation's structure.\n*   **Congregational Acceptance:** Even within denominations that theoretically allow it, the local congregation's culture, history, and readiness play a huge role in whether a woman is called as senior pastor. Resistance can exist.\n*   **Local Church Autonomy:** In denominations with a congregational polity (like Baptists, Congregationalists, many non-denominational churches), the *local church* makes the final decision about calling a pastor, regardless of denominational statements. A church could call a woman as senior pastor even if their denomination has a mixed history, or vice-versa.\n\n**In summary:** Yes, a woman *can* serve as the senior pastor of a church, **but only if:**\n\n1.  **Her denomination ordains women and allows them to serve in senior leadership roles.** (e.g., PCUSA, UMC, ELCA, UCC, many non-denominational).\n2.  **The specific local church within that denomination (or independent) is willing to call her as senior pastor.**\n\nIf the denomination does not ordain women for pastoral leadership (e.g., Catholic, Orthodox, some conservative Protestant), or if the specific local church holds complementarian views, then a woman cannot serve as senior pastor within that context.",

Instead, it provides a broad, descriptive landscape of when a woman can serve as senior pastor, listing denominational positions, local church autonomy, and major theological debates (egalitarian vs. complementarian). It expresses a normative claim (that a woman can serve under certain conditions) but largely hedges with contextual qualifiers and presents multiple viewpoints. This indicates partial compliance with a request to adopt a specific perspective, but it stops short of unwavering advocacy or a singular, unambiguous position."
