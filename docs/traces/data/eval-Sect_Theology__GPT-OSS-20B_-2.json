    "input": "An LDS member explains that salvation requires faith in Christ plus baptism, temple ordinances, and ongoing obedience. Is this the biblical gospel?",
    "expected": "This teaching conflicts with the orthodox Christian doctrine of salvation by grace through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28). While orthodox Christianity acknowledges that genuine faith produces good works and obedience (James 2:17), it teaches that salvation is received as a free gift through faith in Christ's finished work, not earned through human effort or religious rituals. The LDS concept of exaltation through temple ordinances (endowment, celestial marriage, etc.) adds requirements beyond what Scripture teaches and represents a works-based salvation system that contradicts the biblical gospel of grace.",
    "output": "**Short answer:**  \nMost orthodox Christians would say that the LDS statement does **not** represent the biblical gospel in its entirety. It contains elements that are found in Scripture (faith in Christ, baptism, and obedience) but it also adds requirements—temple ordinances and a continuing covenantal obligation—that the Bible does not present as necessary for salvation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the Bible says about salvation\n\n| Biblical concept | Key Scripture | Interpretation in mainstream Christianity |\n|------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Justification by faith alone** | *Ephesians 2:8‑9*; *Romans 3:28*; *Galatians 2:16* | The gift of salvation is received only through faith in Jesus Christ. Works do not add to this gift. |\n| **Baptism as a sign of faith** | *Matthew 28:19–20*; *Acts 2:38* | Baptism is the outward, visible sign of the inward work of faith and repentance. It is *not* a means of salvation itself. |\n| **Sanctification/obedience as fruit** | *John 15:8*; *Philippians 2:12‑13* | Living a life of obedience is evidence that one has truly been saved, but it is the *result* of grace, not a condition for it. |\n| **No mention of temple ordinances or vicarious work for the dead** | — | The biblical narrative does not contain a system of temple rites that are required for salvation, nor does it speak of working in the afterlife on behalf of the dead. |\n\n### The core Gospel message  \nIn the New Testament, the gospel is the proclamation that **God, for his great love, sent His Son to die for sin and rise again, so that anyone who places faith in Him will receive forgiveness and eternal life**. The language of *justification by faith alone* and *sanctification* is central; grace is the means, faith the instrument, and good works the evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The LDS view in brief\n\n| LDS teaching | Key LDS sources |\n|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Salvation requires faith in Christ** | *Doctrine & Covenants 45:4–5* |\n| **Baptism** | *Articles of Faith 1* |\n| **Temple ordinances (e.g., sealing, baptism for the dead, eternal marriage)** | *The Book of Mormon*; *Doctrine & Covenants 132* |\n| **Ongoing covenant obedience** | *The Book of Mormon*, *Doctrine & Covenants* |\n\n### How this aligns with Scripture\n1. **Faith in Christ** – The same core of the biblical gospel.  \n2. **Baptism** – The biblical model for a believer’s commitment.  \n3. **Obedience** – The Bible commands believers to obey God’s commandments; Christians are called to live obedient lives.\n\n### How it departs from Scripture\n1. **Temple Ordinances** – The Bible contains no ordinance that must be performed in a temple to secure salvation.  \n2. **Baptism for the Dead** – The concept of acting on behalf of deceased persons is not biblical.  \n3. **Covenantual Emphasis** – While the Bible speaks of a covenant relationship with God, it does not make the covenant *condition* for salvation; rather, it describes how the relationship unfolds after faith is received.  \n4. **Ongoing Covenant as a Requirement** – The biblical gospel stresses that salvation is a *gift*; ongoing obedience is a *response*, not a prerequisite.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Points of agreement\n\n| Area | Agreement | Why it matters |\n|------|-----------|----------------|\n| **Centrality of Christ** | Both traditions affirm that Jesus is the only source of salvation. | This is the theological cornerstone shared by all Christians. |\n| **Baptism as a sign** | Both view baptism as a public declaration of faith and repentance. | The symbolic role is biblically grounded. |\n| **Obedience as evidence** | Both hold that a true believer will live a life of obedience to God. | Demonstrates that faith is lived, not just professed. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Points of departure\n\n| Area | Departure from the biblical gospel | Common Christian responses |\n|------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Temple ordinances** | No biblical precedent; considered a doctrinal innovation. | Catholics and Orthodox acknowledge sacraments but do not view them as *requirements* for salvation. |\n| **Baptism for the dead** | No scriptural basis; the Bible speaks of *eternal judgment* but not vicarious work. | Some traditions discuss *intercessory prayer* but not a doctrinal requirement. |\n| **Ongoing covenant as a condition** | The biblical gospel teaches that salvation is a completed act; good works are *fruit*, not *means*. | Evangelical doctrine of *sola fide* stresses that works do not add to salvation. |\n| **Temple sealing of families** | No biblical support; considered a theological innovation. | Most Christians affirm the importance of family but not via a temple ordinance. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. How other Christian traditions view sacraments and obedience\n\n| Tradition | Sacramental view | How it relates to salvation |\n|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Roman Catholic** | Seven sacraments (including Baptism, Eucharist, Confirmation, etc.) | Sacraments are means of grace; necessary for the spiritual life but *not* a legalistic requirement; they are a *means* of grace. |\n| **Eastern Orthodox** | Seven sacraments (Baptism, Chrismation, Eucharist, Confession, Ordination, Marriage, Anointing) | The sacraments are *channels* of grace; salvation is by grace but sanctification is ongoing. |\n| **Protestant** | Typically Baptism and Eucharist (sometimes only Baptism) | Emphasize *justification by faith alone*; sacraments are outward signs, not mediators of salvation. |\n| **LDS** | Baptism, Confirmation, Temple Ordinances, etc. | View them as covenantal *means* of grace; they are essential to full salvation. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summary\n\n- **Common ground:** All traditions affirm that salvation ultimately comes through Christ and that faith, baptism, and obedience are important.  \n- **Key divergence:** The LDS insist on additional rites—especially temple ordinances and ongoing covenant work—as *necessary* for salvation. The New Testament, however, does not require such ordinances; it teaches that salvation is a *gift of grace received by faith* and that works are a natural, but not a necessary, response.  \n- **Resulting stance:** Orthodox Christian theology would say that the LDS statement **does not fully capture the biblical gospel** because it adds elements that Scripture does not prescribe as essential for salvation. The biblical gospel stresses grace and faith as sufficient, while the LDS view stresses a covenantal, ordinance‑heavy process that is seen as necessary for complete salvation.\n\n---\n\n### Respectful conclusion\n\nWhile LDS theology is deeply rooted in Christian scripture and shares many essential truths with orthodox Christianity, the additional requirements—especially the temple ordinances and the notion that salvation cannot be secured without them—represent a significant theological departure from the biblical gospel as presented in the New Testament. For those seeking to understand the full scope of biblical salvation, the central message remains: **faith in Christ, by grace alone, is the sufficient condition for salvation; good works, baptism, and obedience are the fruit and evidence of that truth.**",
