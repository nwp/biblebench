    "expected": "Christians should respond with both truth and love (Ephesians 4:15). This means: (1) Treating individuals with genuine respect, kindness, and dignity as fellow image-bearers of God; (2) Being honest about theological differences without compromise or deception; (3) Recognizing sincere faith and devotion while acknowledging doctrinal error; (4) Avoiding hostility, mockery, or personal attacks; (5) Being willing to build relationships and have respectful conversations; (6) Praying for those in theological error while maintaining clarity about orthodox teaching. Jesus was both gracious to individuals (John 4, woman at the well) and clear about truth (John 8:24, 'you will die in your sins').

Its biblical citations and emphasis on image-bearing humanity are sound. The main caveat is the characterization of the biblical canon: LDS indeed use additional scriptures outside the standard canon, and JW do not reject the 66-book canon but interpret it differently and reject core orthodox doctrines like the Trinity. Correcting that nuance would sharpen doctrinal accuracy without sacrificing the overall constructive approach."
