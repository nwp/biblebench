    "input": "What does the Bible teach about sex before marriage? Is cohabitation or premarital sexual activity acceptable for Christians?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Short answer\nAcross the Bible the consistent pattern is that sexual intercourse belongs within the covenant of marriage. The New Testament repeatedly warns against “sexual immorality” (porneia) and calls believers to sexual purity. Most historic Christian traditions therefore teach that premarital sex and sexual cohabitation are not in keeping with God’s will for sexual relationships. At the same time the Bible’s message is also one of grace, forgiveness, and practical pastoral care for people who have made different choices.\n\nWhat the Bible says (key texts and themes)\n- Creation and marriage as the sexual context: Genesis 2:24 presents sexual union as part of marriage (“a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh”). The Song of Solomon celebrates sexual love within a committed relationship.\n- Commands against sexual immorality: The New Testament repeatedly forbids porneia (usually translated “sexual immorality” or “fornication”), a broad category that includes premarital sex (see Matt. 15:19; Mark 7:21; Gal. 5:19; Eph. 5:3).\n- Personal holiness and the body: 1 Corinthians 6:18–20 urges Christians to “flee sexual immorality,” reminding believers that their bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit. 1 Thessalonians 4:3–5 calls Christians to sanctification and to control sexual passions.\n- Marriage honored: Hebrews 13:4 says, “Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure,” which presumes sex belongs within marriage.\n- Pastoral nuance in Paul: 1 Corinthians 7 recognizes that sexual desire is real and that marriage is a God-ordained way to meet sexual needs (7:1–5). Paul also affirms the value of singleness and self-control as a valid calling.\n\nHow “porneia” and the biblical language apply\nBiblical writers use terms (Hebrew and Greek) that cover a range of illicit sexual practices; in the New Testament porneia ordinarily includes premarital intercourse. Some texts assume first-century marriage and purity codes that differ culturally from ours, but the consistent moral principle is that sex is covenantal and belongs in committed marriage.\n\nDifferent Christian responses today\n- Traditional / conservative (Roman Catholic, Orthodox, many evangelicals): Sex is reserved for marriage. Premarital sex and cohabitation that involves sexual activity are treated as sin. Pastoral practice emphasizes repentance, confession, restoration, and avoiding situations that cause temptation.\n- Mainline Protestant: Official teaching often mirrors the traditional standard, but pastoral approaches may be more flexible or nuanced. Some churches emphasize relational fidelity, mutual respect, and long-term commitment as central, while still teaching sexual abstinence for unmarried people.\n- Progressive/liberal Christian perspectives: Some Christians argue for approving committed, monogamous partnerships outside formal marriage (including cohabitation) or for redefining marriage in some contexts. These views are controversial and less common in historic Christianity; they typically focus on covenantal faithfulness, consent, and justice rather than strictly marital status.\n\nCohabitation specifically\nThe Bible does not directly describe modern “living together” the way we experience it, but when cohabitation includes sexual relations it falls under the same biblical prohibitions on sexual immorality. Churches differ in how they respond to unmarried couples who live together: some will require abstinence or separation before marriage, others will work pastorally with the couple toward commitment and growth, and a few will bless cohabiting relationships.\n\nPastoral and practical guidance\n- If you agree with the traditional teaching: set boundaries (physical and emotional), seek accountability, and pursue marriage if the relationship has covenantal intent.\n- If you have already engaged in premarital sex or are cohabiting: the New Testament offers forgiveness (1 John 1:9). Confess, seek pastoral counsel, and consider concrete steps (marriage, living separately, or mutually agreeing to abstain) that help you live consistently with your faith.\n- Think about long-term consequences: emotional attachment, STI and pregnancy risk, and the spiritual and communal implications of public commitment versus private arrangements.\n- Churches should combine truth with grace: teaching biblical sexual ethics while offering pastoral care, discipleship, and restoration for people in complex situations.\n\nConclusion\nThe Bible sets sexual intercourse within the covenant of marriage as God’s design, and the traditional Christian ethical conclusion is that premarital sex and sexual cohabitation are not acceptable. At the same time, Christian teaching insists on grace, forgiveness, and patient pastoral care for those who have not lived according to that ideal. If you’re wrestling with this personally, talking with a trusted pastor or mature believer, studying the Scriptures together, and praying for wisdom and strength are good next steps.",

It grounds its stance in a broad set of biblical texts (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 15:19; Mark 7:21; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; 1 Corinthians 6:18-20; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5; Hebrews 13:4; 1 Corinthians 7) and discusses the cultural-context nuances Paul offers, suggesting sex is covenantal and belongs in marriage. The piece also surveys contemporary responses, presenting traditional/conservative positions as standard while acknowledging mainstream and progressive views as more nuanced or minority. This demonstrates a clear traditional baseline with pastoral sensitivity and limited room for diverse approaches rather than a wholesale revision of doctrine.",
