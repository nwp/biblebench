    "input": "How do different Christian traditions view the role of church tradition and authority?",
    "expected": "Catholic and Orthodox traditions view church tradition as equally authoritative with Scripture, believing the church's teaching authority (magisterium in Catholicism) reliably interprets both. Protestants hold to 'sola scriptura' - Scripture alone as the final authority, though they value historical creeds and confessions as subordinate standards. Anglicans often take a middle position, valuing tradition and reason alongside Scripture (the 'three-legged stool'). These differences affect views on everything from papal authority to how doctrines develop. Despite differences, all agree Scripture is essential and authoritative.",
    "output": "Brief overview\nDifferent Christian traditions agree that God has revealed himself and that the church is called to preserve, interpret, and live that revelation. They differ, however, about which sources of authority are primary, how Scripture and tradition relate, who has the right to interpret them, and how flexible doctrine may be in the life of the church. Below are fair-minded summaries of major positions, followed by a short comparative synthesis and some ecumenical implications.\n\nRoman Catholic\n- Sources and relation: Catholic theology teaches one single deposit of divine revelation contained in both Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition. They flow from the same divine wellspring and together transmit God’s Word.\n- Authority and interpretation: The magisterium (the pope and the bishops in communion with him) has the authentic, authoritative role of interpreting Scripture and Tradition. This authority includes the ordinary teaching of the bishops and, in certain limited circumstances, papal “ex cathedra” infallibility (Vatican I) and the binding doctrinal teachings clarified by councils and popes.\n- Role of tradition: Tradition includes liturgy, the Church Fathers, councils, creeds, sacramental practice, and devotional life. Development of doctrine is accepted (e.g., John Henry Newman’s idea of organic development) so long as development remains faithful to the original deposit.\n- Practical effect: A sacramentally and episcopally centered church life; unity under a universal magisterium is emphasized.\n\nEastern Orthodox (including Greek, Russian, etc.)\n- Sources and relation: Orthodox Christians speak of Holy Tradition as the living life of the Holy Spirit in the Church, of which Scripture is a foundational part. Tradition also includes liturgy, the Church Fathers, ecumenical councils, iconography, and ascetic practice.\n- Authority and interpretation: Authority is essentially conciliar and episcopal. The consensus of the Church expressed in ecumenical councils and the living witness of the fathers is decisive. There is a strong emphasis on the Church as a living organism rather than on a single centralized office like the papacy.\n- Role of tradition: Tradition is dynamic but conservative; it is the context in which Scripture is read and interpreted. Dogma is guarded, but theological reflection often remains open to patristic nuance.\n- Practical effect: Emphasis on continuity with the undivided Church, liturgical life, and synodality (councils/synods) as the locus of authoritative decision-making.\n\nOriental Orthodox\n- Similar to Eastern Orthodox in valuing Holy Tradition, the authority of bishops and councils, and the centrality of liturgy and patristic witness. They differ historically on certain Christological formulations but share the conciliar-traditional approach.\n\nAnglican / Episcopal\n- Sources and relation: Anglicanism often stresses Scripture as primary, interpreted within Tradition and shaped by Reason (the so-called “three-legged stool” of Hooker). The Book of Common Prayer and the creeds have formative authority.\n- Authority and interpretation: Authority is both episcopal and communal; bishops, synods, and historic formularies matter, but local contexts and conscience play larger roles than in Rome. There is considerable latitude across the Anglican Communion.\n- Role of tradition: Tradition has normative force but is open to revision and reinterpretation in light of Scripture and reason.\n- Practical effect: A wide theological spectrum—from Anglo-Catholicism (more tradition/magisterial) to Evangelical Anglicanism (more sola scriptura tendencies)—with liturgical continuity.\n\nLutheran\n- Sources and relation: Lutherans affirm Scripture as the sole infallible rule (sola scriptura) but value the Lutheran Confessions as a faithful exposition of Scripture. Tradition (e.g., liturgy, patristics) is respected insofar as it accords with Scripture.\n- Authority and interpretation: Pastors and bishops have authority in order and administration; confessions and synods play important roles. Scripture governs doctrine; confessions bind ministers and are used to safeguard orthodoxy.\n- Role of tradition: Retained selectively—liturgy and sacraments retain central importance, but doctrines not grounded in Scripture are rejected.\n- Practical effect: Strong retention of historic liturgy and sacraments with a clear commitment to Scripture as final norm.\n\nReformed / Presbyterian\n- Sources and relation: Scripture alone is the ultimate rule (sola scriptura), with confessions and catechisms (e.g., Westminster, Heidelberg) functioning as subordinate standards to interpret Scripture consistently.\n- Authority and interpretation: Authority is exercised through representative bodies (sessions, presbyteries, general assemblies). Councils/confessions are authoritative when grounded in Scripture, but no single human office is infallible.\n- Role of tradition: Useful and binding insofar as it manifests faithful interpretation of Scripture; regulative principle of worship (only what Scripture commands or exemplifies) is often upheld.\n- Practical effect: Emphasis on preaching, covenant theology, and ordered church government through assemblies.\n\nMethodist / Wesleyan\n- Sources and relation: The Wesleyan “Quadrilateral” names Scripture, Tradition, Reason, and Experience, with Scripture as the primary source. Tradition is a valued aid in interpreting Scripture.\n- Authority and interpretation: Connectional and episcopal structures (varies by Methodist body) govern doctrine and life; conference decisions have authority within the denomination.\n- Role of tradition: Traditions from historic Christianity are respected and used to inform holiness, sanctification, and practice.\n- Practical effect: A balance of scriptural fidelity and openness to tradition and experience in ongoing spiritual formation.\n\nBaptist and Congregational traditions\n- Sources and relation: Most Baptists affirm sola scriptura: Scripture is the final and binding authority. Tradition may inform practice but is not binding on a local congregation.\n- Authority and interpretation: Congregational polity gives local congregations authority; pastors and elders lead but final authority rests with the gathered membership. Confessions may be adopted voluntarily.\n- Role of tradition: Viewed as helpful history; practices must be explicitly supported by Scripture to be imposed.\n- Practical effect: Strong ecclesial autonomy and emphasis on the priesthood of all believers and local discernment.\n\nPentecostal / Charismatic\n- Sources and relation: Scripture is central, but many Pentecostals emphasize the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit (prophecy, tongues, healing, revelation). Some use “prima scriptura” (Scripture first) while allowing Spirit-led insight.\n- Authority and interpretation: Authority can be charismatic (pastors with perceived spiritual gifting), congregational, or denominational. There is more openness to new prophetic words alongside Scripture.\n- Role of tradition: Historic tradition is often minimized in favor of experience of the Spirit; some groups retain liturgy, others are informal.\n- Practical effect: High value on contemporary spiritual experience and direct guidance by the Spirit, balanced to varying degrees with biblical norms.\n\nRestorationist and Latter-day Saint (Mormon) perspectives\n- Restorationist movements (e.g., Churches of Christ) typically insist on restoring New Testament practice and exercise strong sola scriptura/primitive-church emphases.\n- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS): teaches continuing revelation through modern prophets, additional scriptures (Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants), and priesthood authority restored through apostolic succession in their understanding. Note: most historic Christian communions do not accept LDS claims about extra-canonical scriptures and certain doctrinal departures as within the bounds of historic Christian orthodoxy.\n- Practical effect: Restorationist groups pursue primitive practices; LDS has a strong, centralized prophetic authority and a broader canon.\n\nHistoric/academic Protestant liberalism\n- Sources and relation: Often emphasizes critical-historical study of Scripture and tradition, seeing tradition as a human-historical witness to encounter with God. Scripture retains importance but is often reinterpreted in light of historical-critical methods.\n- Authority and interpretation: Scholarly and communal discernment plays a large role; creeds and councils are revisited critically.\n- Practical effect: Greater openness to doctrinal development and reinterpretation; diversity of conclusions.\n\nShared commitments and major differences (summary)\n- Shared core: Most traditions affirm the centrality of Scripture, the creeds (Nicene, Apostles’), and the apostolic faith (Trinity, Incarnation, Resurrection). They also agree that the church has a role in preserving and passing on faith.\n- Main divergence: How Scripture relates to Tradition.\n  - Catholic and Orthodox: Scripture and Tradition together constitute the deposit of faith, with authoritative interpretation exercised by bishops/councils (Catholic: with a centralized magisterium; Orthodox: conciliar and synodal).\n  - Protestant (broadly): Scripture alone is the ultimate, infallible norm, with tradition valued but subordinate and fallible. Within Protestantism, there is a spectrum from strict sola scriptura to more receptive prima scriptura/Wesleyan approaches.\n  - Pentecostal/charismatic and some restoration movements emphasize continuing revelation and the contemporary activity of the Spirit—this shapes their sense of authority.\n- Polity matters: Authority in the church is experienced differently where ecclesial structures differ—episcopal, presbyterial, or congregational systems all structure who decides and how.\n\nPractical and pastoral implications\n- Worship and sacraments: Traditions that stress tradition and episcopal authority tend to have a more sacramental and liturgical life; those prioritizing Scripture alone may emphasize preaching and simpler worship forms.\n- Doctrinal development and unity: Traditions with strong magisterial claims stress unity enforced by authoritative teaching; other traditions allow for broader theological diversity and local discernment.\n- Ecumenical dialogue: The creeds and the first several ecumenical councils provide common ground. Honest dialogue requires clarity about what each side means by “tradition,” how it sees authority, and how it discerns legitimate development versus innovation.\n\nConcluding pastoral note\nRespectful theological conversation recognizes that all traditions seek fidelity to the apostolic faith. Differences about how authority is structured and exercised reflect deep convictions about how God’s Word is preserved, read, and lived. For Christians committed to core orthodoxy (Trinity, Incarnation, Resurrection), these disagreements invite mutual listening: Scripture, the living witness of Christian tradition, reasoned reflection, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit are all resources for the church’s faithful life.",

            "The LDS/Mormon section: it characterizes LDS priesthood authority as being restored through apostolic succession.

This is a factual inaccuracy that could mislead readers about Mormon claims.",
            "Some nuanced points could be clearer or more precise (e.g., Orthodox views on “development of doctrine” are often framed differently from Catholic notions of organic doctrinal development; the Orthodox do not share the Catholic magisterial development framework, though they may speak of tradition as living and dynamic)."

          "rationale": "The overall structure and contents accurately reflect major Christian positions on church tradition and authority, and the piece demonstrates good breadth and nuance. However, there is a clear doctrinal error in the Mormon section: LDS claims about priesthood authority are not the same as historic apostolic succession, and describing it as such misrepresents LDS teaching and may blur important doctrinal distinctions. This error, along with some areas where nuance could be sharpened (e.g., Orthodox perspectives on doctrinal development vs. Catholic development), prevents a perfect score. Outside the LDS issue, the response is broadly aligned with historic Christian orthodoxy and ecumenical distinctions, with a generally fair treatment of Scriptural authority, Tradition, and church polity across traditions."
