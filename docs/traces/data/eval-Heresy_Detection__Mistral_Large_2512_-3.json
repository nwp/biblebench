    "expected": "This is the heresy of Docetism. It denies the true humanity of Christ. Orthodox Christianity teaches the hypostatic union - Jesus is fully God AND fully human. He had a real physical body, experienced hunger, thirst, fatigue, and truly died on the cross. 1 John 4:2-3 explicitly condemns denying that Jesus came in the flesh, and Hebrews 2:17 states he had to be made fully human to be our high priest.",
    "output": "The theological statement you’ve presented—**\"Jesus only seemed to have a physical body. He was actually a purely spiritual being who appeared human but wasn’t truly human\"**—is a classic example of the heresy known as **Docetism** (from the Greek *dokein*, \"to seem\" or \"to appear\").\n\n### **Evaluation: Why This Is Heretical**\nThis teaching directly contradicts **orthodox Christian doctrine** as defined by the early Church, particularly in the **Chalcedonian Definition (451 AD)** and the **Apostles' and Nicene Creeds**. Here’s why it is heretical:\n\n#### **1. Denial of the Incarnation (John 1:14, Colossians 2:9)**\n- **Orthodox Teaching:** The **Incarnation** (God becoming fully human in Jesus) is a **non-negotiable** Christian doctrine. The Gospel of John declares:\n  > *\"The Word became flesh and dwelt among us\"* (John 1:14).\n  > *\"In Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form\"* (Colossians 2:9).\n  Jesus was **truly God and truly man**—not a phantom or illusion.\n\n- **Docetism’s Error:** By claiming Jesus only *appeared* human, Docetism denies that God truly took on human flesh. This undermines the **reality of the Incarnation**, making Jesus’ life, suffering, death, and resurrection **meaningless** (since an illusion cannot truly die or rise).\n\n#### **2. Contradiction of the Chalcedonian Definition (451 AD)**\nThe **Council of Chalcedon** (one of the **Seven Ecumenical Councils**) defined Christ’s nature as:\n> *\"One and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, recognized in two natures, **without confusion, without change, without division, without separation**; the distinction of natures being in no way annulled by the union, but rather the characteristics of each nature being preserved and coming together to form one person and subsistence.\"*\n\n- **Docetism’s Error:** It **separates** Christ’s divine and human natures by denying His true humanity. Chalcedon insists that Christ is **one person with two natures (divine and human)**, not a divine spirit merely *appearing* human.\n\n#### **3. Undermines the Atonement (Hebrews 2:14-18, 1 John 4:2-3)**\n- **Orthodox Teaching:** Jesus’ **true humanity** was necessary for salvation. The author of Hebrews writes:\n  > *\"Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil\"* (Hebrews 2:14).\n  If Jesus was not truly human, His death could not **truly atone** for human sin.\n\n- **Docetism’s Error:** If Jesus only *seemed* human, His suffering and death were **not real**, making the atonement **a sham**. This contradicts **1 John 4:2-3**, which warns:\n  > *\"This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God.\"*\n\n#### **4. Rejection of the Resurrection (Luke 24:39-43, 1 Corinthians 15:14)**\n- **Orthodox Teaching:** After His resurrection, Jesus **proved His physical body** by eating fish (Luke 24:42-43) and inviting Thomas to touch His wounds (John 20:27). The resurrection was **bodily**, not just spiritual.\n\n- **Docetism’s Error:** If Jesus was never truly human, His resurrection was **not a physical reality**, which would mean:\n  - The disciples were **deceived** (contrary to Luke 24:39).\n  - The resurrection is **meaningless** (1 Corinthians 15:14: *\"If Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.\"*).\n\n#### **5. Early Church Condemnation (Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus, Tertullian)**\nDocetism was **vehemently rejected** by the early Church Fathers:\n- **Ignatius of Antioch (c. 110 AD)** warned against it in his letters, calling it a **\"deadly poison\"** (Letter to the Smyrnaeans 2).\n- **Irenaeus (c. 180 AD)** refuted it in *Against Heresies*, arguing that Jesus was **truly born, truly suffered, and truly died**.\n- **Tertullian (c. 200 AD)** wrote that Docetism was a **\"denial of the faith\"** (*On the Flesh of Christ*).\n\n### **Conclusion: This Is a Dangerous Heresy**\nThe teaching that **\"Jesus only seemed human\"** is **not just a minor theological difference—it is a fundamental denial of Christianity’s core truths**. It:\n✅ **Denies the Incarnation** (God becoming man).\n✅ **Undermines the Atonement** (if Jesus wasn’t human, His death didn’t save us).\n✅ **Rejects the Resurrection** (if He wasn’t human, His rising was an illusion).\n✅ **Contradicts Scripture and Church Tradition** (John 1:14, Chalcedon, early Church Fathers).\n\n### **Orthodox Correction**\nThe proper Christian response is to affirm:\n- Jesus is **fully God** (John 1:1, Colossians 2:9).\n- Jesus is **fully human** (John 1:14, Hebrews 2:14).\n- His humanity was **real, not an illusion** (1 John 4:2-3).\n- His death and resurrection were **historical, bodily events** (Luke 24:39, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4).\n\nThis heresy was rightly condemned in the early Church, and modern Christians must **reject it with equal firmness**.",

It supports these claims with appropriate scripture references (John 1:14; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 2:14; 1 John 4:2-3; Luke 24:39-43; 1 Corinthians 15:14) and notes the early Church’s condemnation of Docetism (Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian; Chalcedon’s formula). The response also links denial of Christ’s humanity to the atonement and resurrection, which is a central orthodox argument. Nuance is well-handled: it distinguishes incarnation, atonement, and resurrection as bodily realities and situates the error within historic doctrinal boundaries. No doctrinal errors are evident."
