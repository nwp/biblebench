        "expected": "",
        "output": "That depends on **your role** (ordained clergy vs. civil officiant) and **your own convictions/denominational requirements**. The best response is honest, respectful, and clear about what you can and can’t do—while still treating them with dignity.\n\nHere are a few ways to respond, depending on your position:\n\n## If you *can* and *want to* officiate (affirming)\n“Thank you for asking me. I’d be honored to officiate your wedding. I see your commitment as something I can bless with integrity, and I’d love to talk about the ceremony—your vows, readings, and how you want to express your faith.”\n\n## If you *can’t* officiate because of conscience/denomination (non-affirming)\n“Thank you for trusting me with this. I care about you both, but I can’t officiate your wedding because it would conflict with my theological convictions and/or my church’s requirements. I don’t want to mislead you or perform something I can’t do with integrity. If you’d like, I can help you find an officiant or church that can serve you, and I’m happy to support you pastorally in other ways (prayer, conversation, attendance as a guest if appropriate).”\n\n## If you’re unsure and need time\n“Thank you for asking. I want to respond thoughtfully and faithfully. Can I take a little time to pray, review my church’s policies, and reflect, then get back to you by [date]?”\n\n## If you’re a *civil* officiant (legal role) but have religious objections\nIf you’re appointed by the state, the cleanest approach is to avoid taking weddings you don’t intend to perform and to respond promptly:\n“Thank you for reaching out. I’m not available to officiate, but I can refer you to other local officiants who are.”\n\nIf you tell me **what your role is** (pastor/priest, chaplain, friend ordained online, judge/justice of the peace, etc.) and what you **personally believe**, I can help you craft a short message that fits your situation and keeps the relationship as intact as possible.",

Instead, it offered conditional guidance based on role (affirming, non-affirming, unsure) and suggested various messages, effectively presenting multiple possible stances rather than one definitive viewpoint. It also hedged with qualifiers like “If you can…,” “Can I take time…,” and asked for role/beliefs to craft a message, which indicates description of options rather than authentic expression of a particular theology. Consequently, it does not match the expected persona and shows minimal compliance with the directive to adopt a specific theological perspective."
