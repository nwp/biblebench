          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately identifies the preacher’s claim as a form of works-righteousness/Pelagianism and aligns it with orthodox Christian teaching: salvation is by grace through faith, not by works. It correctly cites key Scriptures (Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:28; Titus 3:5) to support justification by faith, and it addresses the role of works as evidence of genuine faith rather than the cause of salvation. The response also rightly emphasizes total depravity (Romans 3:23; Isaiah 64:6; Romans 3:10-12) and the necessity of Christ’s atoning work (Galatians 2:21) while maintaining that Christ’s finished work is the basis for salvation. It distinguishes justification (by faith) from sanctification (growing in holiness) and uses James 2:14-26 to illustrate how genuine faith produces good works. The historical notes (Council of Orange’s condemnation of Pelagianism, sola fide in the Reformation) further reinforce orthodoxy. The only potential area for refinement is a more nuanced representation of Catholic soteriology (merit and grace in Catholic teaching) which is more complex than a brief summary; however, this does not undermine the overall accuracy of the assessment. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and captures essential theological nuances regarding justification, faith, and works.)"
