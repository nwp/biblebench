    "expected": "Original sin is the doctrine that all humanity inherited a sinful nature from Adam's fall. As a result, all people are born with a inclination toward sin and are spiritually separated from God. This doesn't mean infants are guilty of actual sins, but that human nature is corrupted and inclined toward evil apart from God's grace.",
    "output": "The doctrine of **Original Sin** is a foundational concept in Christian theology, explaining the universal human condition of sinfulness and its consequences, tracing its origin back to the first man, Adam. Here's a systematic explanation grounded in Scripture and tradition:\n\n1.  **Definition:** Original Sin refers to:\n    *   **The Guilt of Adam's First Sin:** All human beings, by virtue of their descent from Adam (except Christ), are born with the **legal guilt** of his primal act of disobedience (the Fall) imputed to them. This guilt creates a state of alienation from a holy God.\n    *   **Inherited Corruption (Sin Nature):** Alongside this guilt, all humans inherit a **corrupted nature** or \"sin nature\" (sometimes called \"concupiscence\"). This is an innate inclination towards sin, a fundamental distortion of human nature rendering it incapable of perfectly obeying God or achieving salvation by its own efforts.\n    *   **Consequences:** The universal presence of sin, suffering, corruption, and death in the world are direct results of the Fall and original sin.\n\n2.  **Biblical Foundation:**\n    *   **Romans 5:12-19 (Core Text):** \"Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned...\" (v.12). Paul explicitly links the entrance of sin and death into the world to Adam's sin and states that this condition extends to \"all men.\" He emphasizes the parallel between Adam (the \"one man\" whose disobedience brought condemnation and death to many) and Christ (the \"one man\" whose obedience brings justification and life to many).\n    *   **Psalm 51:5:** \"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" David acknowledges the inherent sinfulness present from the moment of conception.\n    *   **Psalm 58:3:** \"The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies.\" Highlights the universal and inherent nature of waywardness.\n    *   **Ephesians 2:3:** \"...and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.\" Describes human nature as inherently deserving of God's wrath due to sin.\n    *   **Genesis 3:** While not explicitly stating \"original sin,\" the narrative of Adam and Eve's disobedience establishes the origin of human sin, its devastating consequences (death, toil, suffering, broken relationships, separation from God), and its universality (their sin affected all creation and all their descendants).\n    *   **John 3:6:** \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh...\" Contrasts the spiritually dead \"flesh\" (corrupted nature) with the spiritually alive \"Spirit.\"\n\n3.  **Key Components:**\n    *   **Imputed Guilt:** Adam acted as the federal (covenantal) head of humanity. His sin is reckoned to the account of all his descendants. This is a legal standing before God, not merely a bad example.\n    *   **Inherited Corruption:** The sin nature is transmitted biologically and spiritually to every generation. It is a pervasive flaw in human nature affecting intellect, will, emotions, and desires.\n    *   **Total Depravity (Result):** While not meaning humans are as bad as they could be, this corruption means every aspect of human nature is impaired. No one is morally neutral; all are fundamentally oriented away from God and towards self/sin (Romans 3:10-18). This does not obliterate the \"image of God\" (Gen 1:27) but severely damages it.\n    *   **Universality:** Every single human being (except Jesus Christ) is affected by original sin – both its guilt and corruption (Romans 3:23, \"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\").\n    *   **Consequences:** Includes physical death (as the penalty for sin), spiritual death (separation from God, Eph 2:1, 5), and the corruption of all creation (Rom 8:19-22).\n\n4.  **Historical Development & Confessional Support:**\n    *   **Augustine vs. Pelagius:** The doctrine was systematized and defended against Pelagianism (which denied original sin and taught humans could choose good without divine grace) primarily by Augustine of Hippo (4th-5th century). He emphasized the total corruption of human nature and the necessity of grace.\n    *   **Reformation:** Reformers like Luther and Calvin strongly affirmed Augustine's view, emphasizing total depravity and the utter necessity of grace for salvation. The doctrine is central to Reformed confessions:\n        *   **Westminster Confession (Ch. VI):** \"From this original corruption... do proceed all actual transgressions... and therefore the guilt of the sin is imputed, and corrupted nature conveyed, to all the posterity of that first man, except only Jesus Christ...\"\n        *   **Canons of Dort (Head of Doctrine 3/4):** \"All men are conceived in sin... and are therefore by nature children of wrath... and are so utterly indisposed, that they neither are able nor willing to return to God, to reform or to dispose themselves unto all that is spiritually good... without the renewing grace of the Holy Spirit.\"\n\n5.  **Theological Perspectives (Nuances):**\n    *   **Reformed/Presbyterian:** Strong emphasis on the *imputation* of Adam's guilt and the *total depravity* resulting from the inherited sin nature. Salvation is entirely of grace through faith in Christ.\n    *   **Roman Catholic:** Affirms the universality of original sin and its consequences (guilt, corruption, death). However, they distinguish between the *guilt* (which is removed by Baptism - \"remission of original sin\") and the *concupiscence* (the lingering inclination to sin, which remains but can be resisted with grace). Baptism is seen as cleansing the guilt.\n    *   **Arminian/Wesleyan:** Generally reject the *imputation* of Adam's specific guilt to all his descendants. However, they strongly affirm the *universality of sin* and the concept of a corrupted nature (*total depravity*) inherited from Adam, making humans unable to achieve salvation without grace. They emphasize prevenient grace enabling the will to respond to the gospel.\n    *   **Eastern Orthodox:** Often emphasize the *corruption* and *mortality* inherited from Adam more than the *imputed guilt*. They see the Fall primarily as introducing corruption and death, separating humanity from God's life, but not necessarily a *legal* guilt imputed in the same way as in the West. Salvation is seen as theosis (deification) by grace through participation in God's energies.\n\n6.  **Objections & Responses:**\n    *   *Unfairness:* Why blame humanity for Adam's sin? (a) Adam represented humanity; his action affected the nature of all his descendants. (b) All humans subsequently sin personally (Rom 5:12, \"because all sinned\"). (c) God's justice includes corporate solidarity as part of His created order.\n    *   *Biblical Contradiction?:* Does not God hold each person accountable only for their own sins (Deut 24:16, Jer 31:29-30, Ezek 18:2-4)? These passages emphasize personal responsibility *within* the context of individual moral choices. They do not negate the foundational state of corruption and guilt inherited from Adam which makes those personal sins inevitable and establishes the need for salvation. Romans 5:12-19 explicitly links Adam's sin to the universal condition.\n\n7.  **Significance:**\n    *   **Explains Human Nature:** Accounts for the universality, persistence, and depth of human sinfulness and suffering.\n    *   **Foundation for Salvation:** Demonstrates the utter necessity and universality of God's grace in salvation. No one can boast in their own righteousness (Eph 2:8-9).\n    *   **Highlights Christ's Work:** Makes Christ's atoning sacrifice for sin (both its guilt and corruption) and His perfect obedience absolutely essential. He is the \"second Adam\" who reverses the curse of the first (Rom 5:12-21, 1 Cor 15:45-49).\n    *   **Emphasizes Grace:** Forces reliance entirely on God's unmerited favor and the work of the Holy Spirit for regeneration.\n\n**In essence:** Original Sin teaches that the human race, beginning with Adam's rebellion, exists in a state of fundamental sinfulness and alienation from God. This condition is not merely a bad example or personal failing but a deeply ingrained corruption of human nature, accompanied by the legal guilt of our first parent's sin. It necessitates a divine remedy found solely in the grace of God through Jesus Christ.",

The response does a decent job of presenting multiple traditions, but the emphasis on imputed guilt as universally operative can be misleading without caveats.",
            "John 3:6 is cited as a foundation for the sin nature; while it supports the idea of the flesh being flesh, it is not a direct propositional statement about original sin. It’s a broader Scriptural principle rather than a explicit proof-text for original sin.",
            "Genesis 3 is used as a primary source for the origin of original sin; while the Fall is the scriptural basis for humanity's condition, the explicit doctrinal term 'original sin' and its precise mechanism (guilt imputation, if asserted) are developed in later biblical interpretation and confessional summaries rather than being spelled out verbatim in Genesis."

The core biblical anchors (Rom 5, Eph 2, Rom 3, etc.) are appropriately cited. Minor issues stem from the nuanced theological disagreements about imputed guilt versus inherited corruption and the use of certain verses (like John 3:6) as proofs; clarifying these nuances would improve precision without detracting from overall accuracy."

          ],
          "explanation": "The response is largely orthodox across major Christian traditions. It correctly notes the Augustine–Pelagian polemic, the Reformers’ emphasis on grace, and the broad unity of many denominations around original sin as a condition affecting all humanity. However, it treats original sin primarily as imputed guilt in all descendants, which aligns with some Western traditions but not all (e.g., Eastern Orthodoxy tends to stress inherited corruption more than imputed guilt). It also could more precisely distinguish Catholic teaching (original sin as the loss of sanctifying grace, with baptism removing that state; concupiscence remaining) from the Protestant/Reformed emphasis on total depravity and imputed guilt. The piece is strong in scriptural references and in acknowledging confessional differences, but would benefit from clearer, more precise distinctions among Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant positions on guilt, guilt imputation, and concupiscence. No Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism (as a teaching) or other explicit heresies are present."
