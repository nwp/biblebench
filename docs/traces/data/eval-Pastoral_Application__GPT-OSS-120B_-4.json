    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "**Dear Friend,**\n\nFirst, thank you for trusting me enough to bring this deep and painful part of your life into the light. You are not alone, and I want you to hear the truth of God’s Word spoken with love, not judgment.\n\n---\n\n## 1 You Are Not “Failing” Spiritually\n\n> **“The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed‑in spirit.”**  \n> *Psalm 34:18 (ESV)*  \n\nDepression is a medical condition—just as diabetes, asthma, or heart disease are. It is **not** a sign that you lack faith or that you are sinning. The Apostle Paul, a man of great faith, described his own “thorn in the flesh” (2 Cor 12:7‑10). He never said that his suffering meant he was spiritually inferior; rather, he called it “a messenger of Christ” that kept him humble and dependent on God’s grace.\n\nThe Bible never teaches that true believers are immune to mental illness. In fact, the psalmists, the prophets, and even Jesus’ disciples all experienced sorrow, anxiety, and despair. The problem is not that you are spiritually weak; it is that you are a human being living in a fallen world where pain and brokenness are real.\n\n---\n\n## 2 Medication Is Not a Lack of Trust\n\n> **“For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self‑discipline.”**  \n> *2 Timothy 1:7 (NIV)*  \n\nGod gave us wisdom to develop medicines that can help the body and the mind. Seeking medical help **does not** mean you doubt God; it means you are using the resources He has placed in the world for healing. The apostle Paul writes in *James 5:14‑15* that the church should call elders to pray **and** anoint the sick with oil, “and the prayer of faith will save the one who is ill.” The word “faith” there does **not** exclude medical treatment. It simply adds prayer to the therapeutic plan.\n\nThink of medication as a tool, like a walking stick for someone whose leg is broken. Using the stick does not mean you lack confidence in walking; it means you acknowledge that you need support as you heal.\n\n---\n\n## 3 What the Bible Says About Suffering and Faith\n\n| Scripture | What It Teaches | How It Helps You |\n|-----------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Psalm 42:11** – “Why are you downcast, O my soul?” | Even the psalmist wrestles with despair, yet he calls on God for hope. | It’s okay to be honest with God about how you feel. |\n| **Isaiah 41:10** – “Do not fear… I am with you.” | God promises His presence in terror and trouble. | Remember that your anxiety is not a sign that God has abandoned you. |\n| **Philippians 4:6‑7** – “Do not be anxious… the peace of God… will guard your hearts.” | Peace is a promise, not a feeling we must manufacture. | Turn anxiety over in prayer, trusting that God’s peace can guard you, even when your mind feels foggy. |\n| **2 Cor 12:9‑10** – “My grace is sufficient… for when I am weak, then I am strong.” | Weakness is the place where God’s power is displayed. | Your struggles can become a conduit for the Holy Spirit’s work in you and around you. |\n| **Romans 12:1‑2** – “Present your bodies as a living sacrifice… be transformed by the renewal of your mind.” | The whole person (mind, body, spirit) matters. | A holistic approach—medication, therapy, prayer, community—is biblical. |\n\n---\n\n## 4 Practical Steps You Can Take\n\n### A. **Continue Professional Care**\n- **Medication**: Stay with the regimen your doctor prescribes. If side effects trouble you, discuss adjustments; this is not a spiritual failure but responsible stewardship of your health.\n- **Therapy/Counseling**: A Christian therapist can help you process thoughts, identify biblical truths, and develop coping skills. *James 5:16* encourages us to “confess your faults to one another and pray for one another”—confiding in a trained counselor can be a form of that mutual support.\n\n### B. **Integrate Spiritual Disciplines**\n1. **Prayer** – Not to “force” joy, but to *pour* your heart out: “God, I feel hopeless. Help me hold onto you.”  \n2. **Scripture** – Keep a short list of verses (like those above) to read when the darkness feels heavy. Even a single line can anchor you: *“The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.”* (Psalm 23:1).  \n3. **Worship** – Songs that remind you of God’s love can bypass the mind’s negativity. Singing “Amazing Grace” or “O Come to the Altar” may create space for the Holy Spirit’s comfort.  \n4. **Community** – Join a small group or a “recovery” fellowship within the church. Being honest about your journey can break the stigma and allow others to pray for you (Gal 6:2).\n\n### C. **Seek “Spiritual” Medical Advice When Needed**\n- **Pastoral Counseling** – I’m happy to sit with you, listen, and pray.  \n- **Christian Counseling** – Professionals trained in both psychology and theology (e.g., those affiliated with the *American Association of Christian Counselors*) can integrate biblical truth with evidence‑based therapy.\n\n### D. **Set Gentle, Realistic Goals**\n- **Daily**: A short devotional (5 min), a brief walk, an email or text to a trusted friend.  \n- **Weekly**: Attend a worship service, meet a small‑group, schedule a therapy session.  \n- **Monthly**: Review medication with your doctor, assess any side‑effects, and adjust as needed.\n\n### E. **Cultivate Patience with Yourself**\n- Depression rarely vanishes instantly. Celebrate tiny victories—getting out of bed, reading a Psalm, completing a work task. These “small grains” become a harvest over time (1 Cor 15:58).\n\n---\n\n## 5 The Church’s Role: Grace, Not Judgment\n\nIf members of your church have said, “Just have more faith,” that reflects a **misunderstanding**, not a biblical truth. God’s love is **unconditional** (Romans 8:38‑39), and He calls us to **carry each other’s burdens** (Gal 6:2). If you feel judged, consider speaking privately with a pastor or elder you trust, explaining how those comments hurt you. Ask the church to:\n\n1. **Pray** for you (not just about you, but with you).  \n2. **Support** you in practical ways—maybe a meal, a ride, or a listening ear.  \n3. **Educate** its members on mental health so that stigma fades.  \n\n---\n\n## 6 A Word of Hope\n\n> **“He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”**  \n> *Revelation 21:4 (ESV)*  \n\nGod has not abandoned the broken‑hearted in this present age, and He promises a future where all sorrow is finally healed. Until then, He walks with you in the darkness, offering His peace, His presence, and His love.\n\n---\n\n### My Prayer for You\n\n> **Father,** thank You for this dear child who is wrestling with depression. Grant them the wisdom to follow wise medical counsel, the comfort of Your Spirit, and the love of a supporting community. May they feel Your nearness each day, even when the mind is clouded, and may they grow in the knowledge that their worth is found **solely** in being Your beloved child, not in how well they can “beat” their brain. Strengthen their trust in You—not as a test of faith, but as a refuge of grace. In Jesus’ name, Amen.\n\n---\n\n**You are *not* spiritually failing.** You are a beloved child of God navigating a painful reality, and you are doing the right thing by seeking help. Keep pressing on, hold to the promises of Scripture, and let the church be a place of grace, not judgment. If you ever need someone to talk with, pray with, or simply sit beside you, please know my door (and my heart) is always open. \n\n*With love in Christ,*  \n*Pastor [Your Name]*",

This misrepresentation affects the theological integrity of the entire answer. When evaluating theological accuracy and biblical grounding, this error undermines doctrinal soundness and scriptural grounding, though the rest of the guidance (careful treatment, holistic health, avoiding judgment, etc.) reflects sound pastoral practice. Nuance is present in encouraging balanced care and compassion, but the key biblical misstatement is enough to lower the overall assessment."
