    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "As a theologian, I approach this question by examining Scripture, historical theology, and doctrinal development with fairness and precision.\n\n### **1. Scriptural Data on Baptismal Formulas**\n\nThe New Testament presents two distinct patterns:\n\n**A. The Trinitarian Formula (Matthew 28:19)**\n> \"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, **baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit**.\"\n\nThis is the direct command of the resurrected Christ in the Great Commission, recorded in Matthew's Gospel. It is the clearest and most explicit baptismal formula in Scripture.\n\n**B. Baptism \"in the name of Jesus\" (Acts)**\nSeveral passages in Acts describe baptisms performed specifically \"in the name of Jesus Christ\":\n* Acts 2:38: \"Repent and be baptized every one of you **in the name of Jesus Christ** for the forgiveness of your sins...\"\n* Acts 8:16: (Regarding Samaritan believers) \"they had only been baptized **in the name of the Lord Jesus**.\"\n* Acts 10:48: (Cornelius' household) \"he commanded them to be baptized **in the name of Jesus Christ**.\"\n* Acts 19:5: (Disciples of John) \"they were baptized **in the name of the Lord Jesus**.\"\n\nThere is no record in the New Testament of anyone using the exact phrase \"in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\" while performing a baptism. However, the practice in Acts is consistently described as baptism \"in the name of Jesus.\"\n\n### **2. Orthodox Christian Theology & Historical Consensus**\n\nFor nearly two millennia, the historic, orthodox Christian position (held by Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Protestant traditions) is as follows:\n\n* **Matthew 28:19 is prescriptive:** It is understood as Christ's authoritative command establishing the **form and meaning** of Christian baptism. Baptism is an initiation into covenant relationship with the Triune God.\n* **The Acts passages are descriptive:** They summarize the essential **authority and identity** under which the baptism was performed—that is, into the faith and lordship of Jesus Christ, the central figure of the Trinitarian confession. \"In the name of Jesus\" likely functioned as a shorthand identifying a baptism as distinctly *Christian* (versus John's baptism or other washings). It signifies baptism into His death and resurrection (Romans 6:3) and under His authority.\n* **No inherent contradiction:** Orthodox theology does not see a contradiction. The Trinitarian formula from Matthew defines the full theological reality, while the Acts descriptions highlight the christocentric focus of the apostolic preaching. Baptism \"in the name of Jesus\" *presupposes* the fuller Trinitarian faith, as seen in the immediate context of Acts 2:38, which mentions the gift of the Holy Spirit.\n* **Historical Practice:** From the late 1st century onward (e.g., the *Didache*, c. 90 AD), the universal practice of the early Church was to baptize using the Trinitarian formula. This was standardized in all ancient liturgies and defended against deviations.\n\n### **3. Oneness Pentecostal Theology: Agreement & Departure**\n\n**Areas of Agreement:**\n* **High view of Scripture:** Oneness theologians rightly emphasize the repeated pattern in Acts.\n* **Christocentric focus:** They correctly stress that salvation is found in the name and person of Jesus Christ alone (Acts 4:12).\n* **Sacramental seriousness:** They share with orthodox Christianity a belief that baptism is not merely symbolic but a moment of divine grace and obedience.\n\n**Areas of Significant Departure:**\n* **Rejection of the Trinity:** The core issue is not merely baptismal formula but **Christology and the doctrine of God**. Oneness Pentecostalism (also called Modalism or Sabellianism) rejects the eternal distinction of Persons within the one Godhead. It teaches that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not distinct co-equal, co-eternal persons, but different \"modes\" or \"roles\" of the one singular Person of God. Thus, for them, \"Jesus\" is the name of the one God who is Father, Son, and Spirit. A Trinitarian formula wrongly implies three separate beings.\n* **Interpretation of Matthew 28:19:** They often interpret this verse as a later addition or as a command to baptize in the *authority* of the one God who has revealed Himself as Father (in creation), Son (in redemption), and Holy Spirit (in indwelling). They argue the Apostles correctly understood and obeyed this by using the name \"Jesus,\" which encapsulates the whole.\n* **Validity of Sacraments:** They depart from all major Christian traditions by declaring Trinitarian baptisms **invalid**, requiring re-baptism in Jesus' name. Orthodox Christianity, in contrast, generally recognizes the validity of baptisms performed with water and the Trinitarian name, even across denominational lines, because it recognizes the same object of faith—the Triune God.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\n**Scripturally,** both formulas are present. The Trinitarian formula is the direct command of Christ defining baptism's nature. The Acts passages describe the apostolic practice of baptizing under the authority and into the salvation offered by Jesus.\n\n**Theologically,** the disagreement is foundational. It is not primarily about liturgical words but about the **nature of God Himself.**\n\n*   The orthodox position sees baptism \"in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\" as the fulfillment of Christ's command and the confession of the tri-personal God who saves.\n*   The Oneness position sees baptism \"in Jesus' name\" as the necessary confession of the one God who is Jesus, rejecting the framework of the Trinity as unbiblical.\n\nTherefore, while Oneness Pentecostals base their practice on a sincere and literal reading of the Acts narratives, orthodox Christianity, drawing on the whole counsel of Scripture and the consistent witness of the historic Church, upholds the Trinitarian formula as the apostolic and Christ-given norm, understanding the Acts formulas as faithful applications of it. The dispute remains a profound and irreducible division within Christendom over the doctrine of God.",

            "Overgeneralization about early baptismal practice: the claim that the “universal practice” of the early Church was to baptize with the Trinitarian formula is an oversimplification. While the Triune formula is well-attested (including the Didache), there are early and varied attestations of baptisms administered with ‘in the name of Jesus’ or JESUS-centered formulae, and the exact practices likely varied by community and era.",
            "Didache mention and dating nuance: the response rightly notes a triune formula in Didache, but the Didache is not NT and dating is debated (roughly late 1st century). A clearer note that Didache reflects an early but non-canonical source would help avoid implying NT-level uniformity across all churches from the outset.",
            "Modalist language caveat: the characterization of Oneness theology as “Modalism” (Sabellianism) is common in polemics but Oneness theology itself emphasizes dynamic unity of God rather than a strict historical label; labeling it as classic modalism can be helpful for clarity but risks an overly narrow caricature if not nuanced.",
            "Minor clarity issue: the text could more explicitly distinguish between baptismal “formula” and “understanding of God.” The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19) prescribes a Trinitarian grammar, while Acts uses Christ-centered language (e.g., ‘in the name of Jesus’). Some modern readers would stress that the issue is not merely wording but whether the baptism coheres with the full apostolic confession of the Triune God.",
            "A few nuanced scholarly positions are underrepresented: some early sources show strong ecumenical momentum toward Triune baptism, but others argue for a more complex, gradual consolidation of the Trinitarian formula across the early Church. Including these shades would deepen the defensibility of the orthodox position."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response is broadly accurate and well-grounded in Scripture and historic orthodoxy. It correctly identifies Matthew 28:19 as the explicit, prescriptive formula and treats Acts’ baptisms as descriptive of apostolic practice under Jesus’ authority, often summarized as baptism into Christ and under the Spirit. It fairly notes Oneness/Modalist concerns and the broader orthodox pole toward Trinitarian baptism. The main strengths are its clear synthesis of Scripture, historical consensus, and the distinction between formula and doctrinal confession. The main room for improvement is in acknowledging the nuance and regional variation in early baptismal practice (noting early evidence for Jesus’ name baptism alongside the later, more widespread triune formula) and in presenting a slightly more charitable, precise characterization of Oneness theology beyond a simple modalism label."
