        "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
        "output": "My dear brother or sister in Christ, thank you for your vulnerability in sharing this deeply painful situation. Your love for your daughter and your desire to honor God in this are evident. Please know that your feelings of devastation and fear are understandable and heard by our Heavenly Father. Let's seek wisdom from Scripture and the Holy Spirit together.\n\n**1.  Anchor Your Heart in God's Character and Sovereignty:**\n*   **Remember God's Faithfulness:** Your daughter's questioning doesn't diminish God's existence, sovereignty, or love. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8). Her journey is ultimately between her and God, even as you walk alongside her. Trust that God loves her *more* fiercely than you ever could (Psalm 139:1-4, 13-16; Romans 8:38-39).\n*   **Trust God's Sovereignty:** This is not outside God's knowledge or control. He knew this day might come before she was born (Jeremiah 1:5). Commit your anxiety to Him, for He cares for you (1 Peter 5:6-7). Pray fervently for wisdom (James 1:5) and for your daughter, asking the Holy Spirit to work in her heart (John 16:8-11).\n*   **Hope in God's Promise:** God promises that those who seek Him *with their whole heart* will find Him (Jeremiah 29:11-14). This journey, even through doubt, can be part of her seeking. Romans 8:28 reminds us God works *all* things together for good for those who love Him. Pray for His redemptive purpose to be fulfilled.\n\n**2.  Respond to Your Daughter with Grace and Connection (Not Fear):**\n*   **Prioritize Relationship Over Rightness:** Your immediate goal is not to \"win\" an argument or force a specific belief, but to **keep communication open** and your relationship strong. She needs to know your love for her is *unconditional*, not contingent on her belief. Say something like: \"I love you deeply, and nothing you say could change that. Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me how you're feeling. I'm here to listen and walk with you.\"\n*   **Listen Actively and Without Judgment:** Ask open-ended questions: \"Tell me more about what you're wrestling with?\" \"What parts of faith are hardest for you right now?\" Listen more than you speak. Validate her feelings: \"It makes sense that you'd have big questions at your age. That's healthy.\" Avoid defensiveness (\"How could you think that?\"), dismissal (\"You'll grow out of this\"), or threats (\"If you don't believe, you can't be part of this family\").\n*   **Share Your Own Journey (Carefully):** If appropriate, briefly share your own moments of doubt or questions you've wrestled with. This normalizes the struggle and shows her faith is a journey, not a static destination. Be careful not to make it about *your* pain: \"When I was your age, I wondered too...\"\n*   **Explore Questions Together:** If she's open, offer to explore her questions *with* her, not *against* her. Find reputable resources (books like \"The Reason for God\" by Tim Keller, \"Doubt: A Pastor's Struggle with Faith\" by Brian McLaren; websites like Biola University's \"Faith Comes By Hearing\" or Desiring God's Q&A section) or connect her with a trusted, mature Christian mentor (a youth pastor, a wise older woman from church). Frame it as: \"I want to understand this with you. Let's find answers together.\"\n\n**3.  Practical Steps Forward:**\n*   **Don't Panic or Force:** Resist the urge to bombard her with apologetics lectures or demand immediate answers. This often backfires. Allow space for her to process. Let her know you're available when *she* wants to talk.\n*   **Maintain Connection:** Continue normal activities together – shared meals, walks, watching a show. Don't let the topic dominate every interaction unless she brings it up. Keep the relationship warm and connected.\n*   **Model Authentic Faith:** Let her see you live out your faith authentically – your dependence on prayer, your trust in God during difficulties, your love for the church community (even if imperfectly). Your life is a powerful sermon.\n*   **Guard Your Speech:** Be extremely careful about what you say to others (especially extended family or church members) about her struggle. Gossip or well-meaning but hurtful comments can damage her trust. Pray for wisdom (Proverbs 15:28).\n*   **Seek Support:** Confide in your spouse (if applicable) and a trusted, mature Christian friend or your pastor. You need prayer and encouragement. Consider seeking counsel from a Christian family therapist if the communication breaks down or the situation feels overwhelming. It's a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\n**4.  Remember: Faith is a Journey, Not a Destination:**\n*   Your daughter's questioning doesn't mean she has abandoned faith forever. For many, this is a crucial step towards a more authentic, owned faith. God often uses doubt to refine us and draw us closer to Himself (1 Peter 1:6-7). Your role is to be a steady, loving anchor, pointing her towards Christ, not demanding she conform to a specific timeline or expression of belief.\n\n**Scripture for Your Comfort and Guidance:**\n*   **On God's Faithfulness:** \"Because of the Lord’s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.\" (Lamentations 3:22-23)\n*   **On Trusting God:** \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.\" (Proverbs 3:5-6)\n*   **On God's Sovereignty:** \"For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears... Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\" (1 Corinthians 13:9-12)\n*   **On Parenting:** \"Start children off on the way they should go; even when they are old they will not turn from it.\" (Proverbs 22:6) - This is a promise of influence, not an absolute guarantee of outcome.\n*   **On God's Care:** \"Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.\" (1 Peter 5:7)\n\n**Final Encouragement:** This is a profound opportunity to model Christ's love and grace. Walk gently, speak kindly, listen deeply, pray constantly, and trust the One who formed your daughter's heart. Your love, patience, and unwavering commitment to her well-being, regardless of her current beliefs, is perhaps the most powerful apologetic she will ever see. God is at work, even in this valley. Lean on Him. You are not alone. Amen.",

Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
        "output": "My dear child of God, thank you for your courage in bringing these deep struggles into the light. Let's sit together and gently seek wisdom from Scripture, for it is the firm foundation for our lives. Your feelings are real, and your questions are weighty. Let me address them with both the truth of God's Word and the boundless compassion of Christ.\n\n**1. God's Love for You is Unconditional and Unchanging:**\n*   **Scripture:** \"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\" (Romans 5:8) \"I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing kindness.\" (Jeremiah 31:3) \"See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! That is what we are!\" (1 John 3:1)\n*   **Truth:** Your feelings, no matter how intense or confusing, do not change God's love for you. He knew you, He knew your heart, and He knew your struggles before you were formed in the womb (Psalm 139:13-16). He pursued you while you were still in rebellion. **God does NOT hate you.** He hates sin because it separates us from Him, but He loves the sinner – and that includes you – with a fierce, sacrificial love demonstrated on the cross. Your same-sex attraction is a part of the brokenness we all inherit in a fallen world; it does not place you outside the reach of God's grace or make you less His cherished child.\n\n**2. Your Identity is Found in Christ, Not Your Feelings:**\n*   **Scripture:** \"So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith... There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" (Galatians 3:26-28) \"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!\" (2 Corinthians 5:17)\n*   **Truth:** Your primary identity is not \"gay\" or \"struggling with same-sex attraction.\" Your primary, eternal identity is \"child of God,\" \"beloved of Christ,\" \"saint\" (holy one), \"new creation.\" While your feelings are real and significant, they are not the totality of who you are. Your worth and value are anchored firmly in God's love and your redeemed identity in Christ. Your feelings are a part of your human experience, but they do not define your core being before God.\n\n**3. Experiencing the Feeling vs. Acting on the Feeling:**\n*   **Scripture:** \"But each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.\" (James 1:14-15) \"Flee from sexual immorality... Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?\" (1 Corinthians 6:18-19)\n*   **Truth:** God created sexuality as a good gift within the boundaries of marriage between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24). Acting on same-sex attraction outside of this God-ordained boundary is sexual immorality, which is sin and grieves God's Spirit within you. **Experiencing the attraction itself is not sin.** Temptation is not sin. We all experience temptations (1 Corinthians 10:13). The struggle arises when we choose to act on those feelings in ways contrary to God's design. The call to holiness applies to *all* believers, regardless of their specific temptations (1 Peter 1:13-16). Your journey involves learning to manage these feelings in ways that honor God.\n\n**4. God's Grace is Sufficient and Provides a Way Forward:**\n*   **Scripture:** \"No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.\" (1 Corinthians 10:13) \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\" (2 Corinthians 12:9)\n*   **Truth:** God understands your struggle intimately (Hebrews 4:15). He promises never to allow a temptation that is beyond your capacity to resist *with His help*. He always provides a \"way out\" – a path to endure and overcome. This path may involve:\n    *   **Deepening your relationship with Christ:** Through prayer, Scripture meditation, worship, and sacraments. Knowing Him more deeply strengthens your spirit.\n    *   **Renewing your mind:** Filling your thoughts with God's truth (Romans 12:2), especially passages affirming your identity in Christ and His design for sexuality.\n    *   **Finding faithful Christian community:** Surrounding yourself with believers who will love you unconditionally, support you, pray with you, and hold you accountable (Galatians 6:1-2, Hebrews 10:24-25). *Crucially, this community must uphold biblical standards while offering radical grace.*\n    *   **Seeking wise, professional counsel:** Christian therapists specializing in sexual identity struggles can provide invaluable tools for understanding your feelings, developing healthy coping mechanisms, and processing past experiences. Resources like Desert AIMS or Harvest USA offer faith-based support.\n    *   **Practicing sexual purity:** Making conscious choices to abstain from sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage, and learning to redirect sexual energy into other areas of life (service, creativity, deep friendships).\n    *   **Embracing your singleness or pursuing heterosexual marriage:** God calls some to singleness for His kingdom purposes (1 Corinthians 7:7-8, 32-35). If you feel called to marriage, seeking a spouse of the opposite sex is the path within God's design. This is a deeply personal journey before the Lord.\n\n**5. The Church's Call: Be Ambassadors of Christ's Love:**\n*   **Scripture:** \"All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors.\" (2 Corinthians 5:18-20)\n*   **Truth:** The Church is called to be a place of healing, grace, and truth. Believers are called to love others as Christ loved us – sacrificially, unconditionally, while also speaking the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). Your presence in the church community is vital. Your struggle is not a disqualification; it is an opportunity for the Body of Christ to learn deeper compassion, to practice true grace without compromise, and to point everyone, including you, to the transforming power of the Gospel. Your journey towards holiness is a witness to God's faithfulness.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\n*   **Yes, you absolutely can be a Christian and experience same-sex attraction.** Your feelings do not negate your salvation or God's love for you.\n*   **No, God does NOT hate you.** He loves you with an everlasting love, demonstrated through the sacrifice of His Son. Your struggle breaks His heart, but His love for you remains constant.\n*   **Your journey involves:** Unwavering trust in God's love, embracing your identity in Christ, resisting temptation through the power of the Holy Spirit, pursuing holiness in thought, word, and deed, finding supportive community, and seeking wise counsel.\n*   **Your struggle is a call to deeper dependence on Christ and deeper community within the Body.**\n\nThis is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be moments of victory and moments of profound struggle. In both, run to the Cross. When you stumble, His grace is there to lift you (1 John 2:1-2). When you feel alone, remember you are never outside His presence or His love (Psalm 139:7-10). Your feelings are real, but they are not the final word. God's Word is.\n\nI encourage you to find a mature, compassionate pastor or counselor who can walk alongside you personally. You are deeply loved by God, and He has a purpose and a future for you (Jeremiah 29:11). Hold fast to the truth that in Christ, you are a new creation, and the old is gone. Let's pray together for strength, clarity, and the deepening of your love for the One who first loved you.\n\n**Resources to Explore:**\n*   **Desert AIMS (Arizona Intensive Ministry Support):** Offers Christ-centered support groups and resources.\n*   **Harvest USA:** Provides resources and support for those seeking to align their sexuality with biblical teaching.\n*   **\"Love into Light\" by David Bennett:** A powerful testimony of finding freedom in Christ.\n*   **\"The Gay Gospel?\" by Alan Shlemon:** A concise, biblical analysis of the topic.\n\nYou are not defined by your feelings, but by Christ's sacrifice and your identity as His child. Press into Him.",

It correctly uses or alludes to key scriptures (Romans 5:8; Jeremiah 31:3; 1 John 3:1; Galatians 3:26-28; 2 Corinthians 5:17; James 1:14-15; 1 Corinthians 6:18-19; 1 Corinthians 10:13; 2 Corinthians 12:9; Psalm 139:13-16; Genesis 2:24; 1 Corinthians 7:7-8) and applies them to the SSA context with clarity about temptation versus sin, and about boundaries within marriage. It also emphasizes grace, forgiveness, and pastoral care, including seeking wise counsel and community support. Nuanced aspects are present: distinction between temptation and formal sexual sin, acknowledgement that different pastoral paths exist (celibacy or heterosexual marriage) without compromising biblical ethics, and the call to witness to Christ’s love in the church. A potential caveat (not a doctrinal error) is that the pastoral emphasis on heterosexual marriage as a viable path can be sensitive in diverse church contexts, but it remains within a conservative-orthodox reading of Scripture. Overall, the response is characteristic of sound evangelical teaching on this topic."

This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide.

That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
        "output": "My dear friends, thank you for your honesty and for seeking counsel. It takes courage to bring these questions into the light, and I'm grateful you trust me enough to share. Your commitment to each other is a beautiful thing – God designed us for deep, covenantal relationships, and it's clear you value the bond of marriage. That heart posture is something to be commended.\n\nNow, let's gently explore this together through the lens of Scripture and God's design.\n\n1.  **God's Design for Sexuality and Covenant:** The Bible consistently presents sexual intimacy as a profound gift, but one *reserved for the covenant commitment of marriage*. Consider:\n    *   **1 Corinthians 6:18-20:** \"Flee from sexual immorality... Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit...? Therefore honor God with your bodies.\" Living together outside of marriage creates a significant environment for sexual temptation, which Scripture calls us to actively *flee*, not casually inhabit.\n    *   **Hebrews 13:4:** \"Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.\" The \"marriage bed\" is defined within the context of the marriage covenant itself.\n    *   **Genesis 2:24:** \"That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.\" This \"one flesh\" union, established by God, is the context He ordained for sexual union. Cohabitation often attempts to achieve the *experience* of this union (\"one flesh\" intimacy) *before* entering into the *covenant* (\"leaves... united to his wife\") God established for it.\n\n2.  **The Nature of Commitment vs. Covenant:** You speak of being \"committed.\" That's wonderful! But God's design for marriage is more than commitment; it's a sacred, public covenant before God and His people. Cohabitation, even with deep commitment, lacks the God-ordained structure, public accountability, and spiritual covering that marriage provides. It's like building a house on shifting sand instead of the rock (Matthew 7:24-27) – the foundation matters immensely for the storms of life.\n\n3.  **Cultural Norms vs. Biblical Standards:** \"Everyone does it now\" reflects the world's shifting standards (Romans 12:2). God's Word doesn't change with cultural trends. While societal acceptance might ease practical concerns, it doesn't alter God's design or the potential spiritual consequences. We are called to be holy, set apart for God's purposes (1 Peter 1:13-16), not conformed to the patterns of the world.\n\n4.  **Practical and Spiritual Challenges:** Beyond the theological, living together presents real hurdles:\n    *   **Increased Temptation:** Constant proximity makes avoiding sexual sin significantly harder.\n    *   **Erosion of Purity:** The \"slippery slope\" is real. What starts as \"just sleeping over\" often leads to compromised boundaries.\n    *   **Hindered Spiritual Growth:** Sin (including sexual immorality) grieves the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 4:30) and can create a barrier to experiencing God's fullness (Psalm 66:18). It can also create distance in your relationship with God and each other.\n    *   **Lack of God's Best:** God's plan isn't to restrict joy but to provide the *safest, most blessed* context for intimacy, commitment, and family. Cohabitation often short-circuits the journey towards that best.\n\n**A Path Forward with Grace and Truth:**\n\n*   **Acknowledge the Struggle:** Recognizing the tension between your desire for intimacy/commitment and God's standard is the first step. Don't dismiss the struggle, but bring it to the cross.\n*   **Repentance and Renewal:** If you've been sexually active, the beautiful message of the Gospel is that forgiveness and a fresh start are available through Christ (1 John 1:9). Repentance means turning away *from* the behavior and *towards* God's design. This might involve practical separation.\n*   **Practical Steps:**\n    *   **Separate Living Arrangements:** This is often the most challenging but necessary step to honor God with your bodies and create space for purity. It removes the primary environment of temptation.\n    *   **Establish Clear Boundaries:** If you visit each other, ensure visits are purposeful (with others present, during daylight hours initially) and avoid situations that invite temptation. Be accountable to each other and a trusted mature Christian (or couple).\n    *   **Pursue Premarital Counseling:** *If* you are genuinely moving towards marriage, engage in thorough, biblically-based premarital counseling *now*. Use this time apart to focus on building a Christ-centered foundation *before* the pressures of cohabitation begin.\n    *   **Reaffirm Your Vows (If Engaged):** If you are already formally engaged, consider reaffirming your commitment to sexual purity until marriage. Make this a shared covenant before God.\n    *   **Seek Accountability:** Connect regularly with a mature Christian friend or mentor who will ask difficult questions and pray with you.\n*   **Focus on the \"Why\":** Remember *why* God set these boundaries: for your protection, your holiness, and His glory. He knows the path that leads to true life and blessing (John 10:10). Trust His wisdom even when it's countercultural.\n*   **Extend Grace to Yourselves:** This is a journey. If you stumble, don't despair. The key is to get back up, confess, receive forgiveness, and recommit to obedience. God's grace is sufficient (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\n**In Closing:** My dear friends, your desire for a lifelong commitment is good. But God invites you to pursue it within the boundaries He lovingly set for your good and His glory. Living together before marriage, while culturally common, falls short of God's standard for sexual purity and covenant relationship. It creates unnecessary obstacles to the spiritual depth and blessing God desires for your marriage.\n\nI strongly encourage you to prayerfully consider separating your living arrangements. Use this time to deepen your individual relationships with Christ, strengthen your commitment to purity, and prepare diligently for the covenant of marriage – not just practically, but spiritually. This path requires sacrifice, but it leads to a foundation built on the Rock, a marriage bed kept pure, and the deep, abiding joy of walking in God's will together. Let's pray about this and seek wisdom together. You are loved, and God has an incredible plan for your union when it's rooted in His ways.",

It emphasizes the difference between personal commitment and the God-ordained covenant of marriage and notes that culture does not determine biblical standards. The answer also addresses practical and spiritual aspects (temptation, accountability, holiness, forgiveness) and offers a Grace-and-Truth pathway (repentance, potential separation, premarital counseling, accountability) that is consistent with pastoral practice. Nuance is shown by distinguishing covenantal design from mere commitment, acknowledging cultural pressures, and highlighting the protective purposes of God’s boundaries (purity, flourishing, unity in marriage). A minor potential area for improvement would be to acknowledge that pastoral approaches can vary among traditions or couples in different circumstances; the response could note that some contexts may require tailored guidance beyond a uniform recommendation to separate. Overall, the response is strong: biblically grounded, doctrinally sound, and nuanced."

Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love.

The pain of losing a child is one of life's most devastating wounds, and your heartache is completely valid in the eyes of both heaven and earth.\n\nThe question you've asked cuts to the core of our faith: How can a loving God permit such tragedy? This is the same cry that resonated through history, from the psalmist's lament to Jesus' own anguish in Gethsemane. Your honest struggle is not a sign of weak faith but of a searching heart that deserves compassion, not pat answers.\n\nScripture offers us the profound mystery of divine sovereignty and human freedom intertwined. God does not delight in death but desires life (Deuteronomy 30:19). The psalmist reminds us that \"the Lord is close to the brokenhearted\" (Psalm 34:18), not as a distant deity who decrees tragedy but as a Father who grieves with us.\n\nWhile Scripture teaches that God can bring good out of suffering (Romans 8:28), this is not a flippant explanation for why tragedy occurs. The promise of Romans 8:28 is not a shallow silver lining but a profound declaration that God's redemptive power can work through human brokenness.\n\nIn the face of such mystery, I encourage you to:\n- Rest in God's presence rather than demanding explanation (Isaiah 55:8-9)\n- Express your raw feelings honestly to God, as David did in the Psalms\n- Lean on Christ, who wept at Lazarus' tomb (John 11:35), showing God's empathy in grief\n- Remember that death is not God's final word—resurrection is (1 Corinthians 15:20-26)\n- Allow your faith community to surround and support you (Galatians 6:2)\n\nYour child's death is not part of God's perfect will but a consequence of living in a broken world. Yet even in this tragedy, God is present, offering comfort that transcends understanding (Philippians 4:7) and working to bring healing and purpose beyond what we can presently see.\n\nMay you find solace in the promise that your child now knows no more tears, no more sorrow, and no more pain—a promise that one day will be fully realized for all creation (Revelation 21:4). Until that day, may you feel the arms of Christ holding you in your grief, the presence of the Spirit sustaining you, and the prayers of the church surrounding you.\n\nPlease know that your journey through grief is not one you walk alone. The Good Shepherd walks beside you in the valley of the shadow of death, and He will guide you through this darkness into His glorious light.",

        "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
        "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
        "output": "My dear friend, thank you for your courage in sharing this struggle. Your pain is real, and your seeking is valid. Let's gently lay this concern before God's Word and wisdom together.\n\n**First, hear this truth: Your struggle with depression does not indicate spiritual failure.** The idea that depression is solely due to insufficient faith or that medication contradicts trust in God is a harmful misconception. Consider these biblical truths:\n\n1.  **God's Sovereignty Over Healing:** God heals in diverse ways. Sometimes healing is instantaneous (Mark 1:41), sometimes it's gradual (Luke 17:14), and sometimes it involves human agents like physicians (Luke 4:23, Colossians 4:14). Using medication is no different than seeking surgery or physical therapy – it's a tool God provides through human wisdom and science. Proverbs 3:19-20 tells us God founded the earth by wisdom; using medicine is part of His created order for human well-being.\n2.  **Jesus' Compassion for Suffering:** Jesus never dismissed those suffering with mental or emotional anguish. He saw them, had compassion, and healed (Matthew 9:10-13, Mark 5:1-20). He wept with those who wept (John 11:35). Depression is a profound form of suffering, and Jesus meets you *in* it, not with accusation, but with mercy.\n3.  **Depression is Not Always Linked to Sin:** While sin can sometimes contribute to emotional distress (Psalm 38:3-4), the Bible presents suffering as a universal human condition (Job, Ecclesiastes, many Psalms) not always tied to personal failure. The man born blind was asked *not* if he sinned, but so that God's power might be displayed (John 9:1-3). Attributing *all* depression solely to lack of faith ignores the complex biological, environmental, and neurological factors involved.\n4.  **The Body is the Temple (But Imperfect Now):** 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 reminds us our bodies belong to God. Taking care of our physical and mental health, including using medication prescribed by a doctor, is an act of stewardship, not a denial of God's power. We live in a broken world where bodies and brains malfunction. Seeking help for your brain's chemistry is no more a failure than seeking insulin for diabetes.\n\n**Regarding the comments you've heard:**\n\n*   **They reflect misunderstanding, not divine truth.** Well-meaning believers may confuse simplistic formulas (faith = prosperity/health) with God's complex ways. This teaching can inflict deep spiritual wounds. It's crucial to separate their imperfect understanding from God's actual character and commands.\n*   **God's Grace is Sufficient:** 2 Corinthians 12:7-10 is powerful here. Paul speaks of a \"thorn in the flesh\" he pleaded for God to remove. God's response? \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\" God didn't remove Paul's struggle; He provided grace *for* it. Your depression may not be instantly healed, but God's grace is actively sustaining you *right now*, even through medication and therapy. This is not weakness negating faith; it's faith relying on God's sustaining power in weakness.\n\n**Practical Steps in Faith:**\n\n1.  **Continue Your Treatment:** Do not feel guilty for taking medication prescribed by a medical professional. It is a responsible act of self-care and faith stewardship. Discontinuing medication against medical advice due to guilt can be dangerous.\n2.  **Seek Wise Counsel:** Continue therapy. A Christian therapist can help integrate faith and mental health. If possible, seek a support group for Christian believers struggling with depression. You are not alone.\n3.  **Gently Educate:** If appropriate and safe, you might gently share this perspective with those who made the comments: \"I appreciate your concern. My faith is important to me, and I believe God honors my seeking help through doctors and medication. It's a way I steward the body He gave me.\" Set boundaries if needed.\n4.  **Focus on Relationship, Not Performance:** Your worth before God is not based on feeling joyful or \"performing\" faith perfectly. It's based solely on Christ's sacrifice (Romans 5:8). Depressed days are still days you can be loved by God. Practice resting in His grace, not striving for a \"faith level\" that earns healing.\n5.  **Lean into Community:** Surround yourself with people who offer support without judgment. Share your struggles with trusted, compassionate believers who will pray with you and walk alongside you, not offer simplistic solutions.\n6.  **Anchor in Scripture:** Meditate on Psalms of lament (like Psalm 13, 42, 43) where the psalmist pours out deep despair *to God* yet ends in trust. Pray honestly like the Psalmists – God can handle your anger, sadness, and questions.\n\n**You are not failing spiritually.** You are a beloved child of God courageously battling a real illness in a broken world. You are taking responsible steps to find healing. God sees your heart, your pain, and your desire for wholeness. He walks with you in the darkness and offers His unfailing grace as your true foundation. Trust in His sufficiency, not in the performance of your faith. You are held, you are loved, and healing – in whatever form God chooses – is possible. Amen.",

              "rationale": "The LLM response accurately affirms that depression is a real condition and not a sign of spiritual failure, and it rightly presents medication and professional care as legitimate tools within faithful living. It consistently grounds its claims in Scripture, referencing Jesus’ compassion, the emissive role of physicians (Luke 4:14; Colossians 4:14), biblical examples of suffering (Job, Psalms, John 9:1-3), and the sufficiency of God’s grace (2 Cor 12:7-10). It emphasizes holistic stewardship of body and mind (1 Cor 6:19-20) and wisely cautions against simplistic, guilt-producing interpretations of suffering (contrast with Job’s friends). The response also offers practical, biblically informed steps for living with depression within a Christian framework, including lament, community, and prudent medical care. Minor interpretive stretches (e.g., connecting Proverbs 3:19-20 directly to medicine) do not undermine overall accuracy but are worth noting as reader discretion rather than doctrinal error. Overall, the answer aligns well with historic orthodoxy, biblical teaching, and nuanced pastoral care. "
