    "input": "Some Oneness Pentecostals teach that baptism must be performed 'in Jesus' name only' and that Trinitarian baptism formulas are invalid. What does Scripture teach?",
    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "Short answer\n- The mainstream Christian interpretation of Scripture, across Catholic, Orthodox, and most Protestant traditions, is that baptism should be conducted in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (the Trinitarian formula found in Matthew 28:19). The Didache (an early Christian manual) likewise prescribes the triune baptism formula.\n- Passages in the book of Acts speak of baptism “in the name of Jesus Christ” or “in Jesus’ name,” which some take as a strict alternative to the Triune formula. Interpreters generally understand these Acts phrases as indicating baptism by the authority of Jesus and/or as shorthand for baptism into the one God who has revealed Himself in Jesus. They are not typically taken to authorize a different baptismal formula for all churches everywhere.\n- The Oneness Pentecostal practice, which teaches baptism strictly “in Jesus’ name” and denies the eternal, personal distinctions of Father, Son, and Spirit, represents a significant departure from the historic, ecumenical understanding of the Godhead and baptism as a Trinitarian sacrament. Most orthodox Christian communities view the Oneness position as incompatible with the scriptural witness and with centuries of doctrinal formulation about the Trinity.\n- In short: Scripture includes both the explicit triune formula in Matthew 28:19 and a number of baptismal references in Acts that emphasize Jesus and His authority. The weight of traditional interpretation across the church’s history supports Trinitarian baptism; Oneness theology presents a different reading of several key texts and is generally classified as non-orthodox by historic Christian standards.\n\nHow the text of Scripture bears on the question\n\n1) The explicit Great Commission command\n- Matthew 28:19: Jesus commands the disciples to baptize “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” This is the clearest scriptural articulation of a Trinitarian baptismal formula and has been the normative basis for baptism in virtually all historic Christian traditions.\n- This verse is consistently cited in support of Trinitarian baptism and the church’s understanding that baptism inaugurates a person into the life of the Triune God.\n\n2) Early practice and Didache\n- The Didache (late 1st or early 2nd century) contains a baptismal formula that explicitly names the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (“in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit”). This shows that the triune formula was already a standard way of baptizing in the earliest Christian communities.\n- The Didache’s pattern aligns with the Matthew 28:19 expectation and reinforces the historic understanding that baptism is into the triune God.\n\n3) Instances in Acts mentioning “in the name of Jesus”\n- Acts 2:38 and several other places (8:16; 10:48; 19:5; 22:16) speak of baptism “in the name of Jesus Christ” or “in Jesus’ name.”\n- These occurrences are often understood in one of two ways:\n  a) They emphasize the authority of Jesus Christ—the one who submits believers to God’s saving work. Baptism is performed under Jesus’ lordship and by His authority.\n  b) They could be read as shorthand for baptism into the one living God who has revealed Himself most fully in Jesus, not as a blanket prohibition or replacement of the Father–Son–Spirit formula.\n- In any case, the presence of Acts references to Jesus’ name does not independently establish a universal, obligatory alternative formula for all Christian baptism, especially given the uniform Triune formula in Matthew 28:19 and the Didache.\n\n4) Other New Testament notes\n- 1 Corinthians 1:13 and similar verses use the idea of being baptized in someone’s name (e.g., Paul or Apollos) in a primarily rhetorical or identity-conscious sense, not as a doctrinal instruction about the exact baptismal formula to be used universally.\n- Passages about baptism into the Spirit (e.g., 1 Corinthians 12:13) point to the spiritual reality of baptism but do not alter the explicit normative formula presented in Matthew 28:19.\n- The overall biblical arc treats baptism as entry into the life of the Triune God, a truth that is reinforced by later creeds (e.g., the Nicene Creed) and by the church’s liturgical practice.\n\nInterpreting the results: how to understand “Jesus’ name” language alongside the Trinity\n\n- The “name” language in Acts reflects the authority of Jesus and the early church’s Christ-centered preaching. People were baptized under the authority of Jesus and into the saving work He accomplished.\n- The Triune formula in Matthew 28:19 communicates the church’s belief in one God in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—whose distinct personal relations are cherished in the life of the church.\n- Many orthodox theologians argue that the two strands are not contradictory:\n  - Baptism in Jesus’ name expresses allegiance to Jesus as the risen Lord and Savior who reveals the Father and who sends the Spirit.\n  - Baptism in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit expresses entry into the life of the Triune God and the church’s confession of the full personal distinctions within the Godhead.\n- In other words, “in Jesus’ name” can be understood as baptism performed under Jesus’ authority and into the one God who has made Himself known fully in Jesus, which still fits within a Trinitarian framework.\n\nWhat orthodox Christian theology affirms and what it opposes, in relation to Oneness teaching\n\n- Agreement points often center on the basic elements of baptism as a doorway into Christ, faith in Jesus, repentance, and the believer’s participation in the church.\n- Departures:\n  - The orthodox view affirms a personal, eternal distinction among the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (the doctrine of the Trinity). Oneness theology denies that distinction in the same way and is considered modalist by historic Christian creeds.\n  - The normative baptismal formula in orthodox theology is the Triune formula (Matthew 28:19 via Didache’s praxis and early creed formation). The Oneness position, insisting on “Jesus’ name only,” represents a significant departure from that historic standard.\n- Practical/ecclesial implications:\n  - For mainstream churches, baptism performed with the Triune formula is considered the standard and valid baptism. A baptism performed with another formula (e.g., strictly “in Jesus’ name”) is typically viewed as lacking the explicit Trinitarian formula, unless there is a recognized theological justification or intent that it was still a baptism into the Triune God by Jesus’ authority.\n  - In Oneness circles, baptism is typically administered with Jesus’ name as the sole formula, based on their reading of certain biblical passages and their doctrinal stance about the Godhead. This is viewed by others as non-orthodox within historic Christian doctrine.\n\nHow to reflect this in a fair, theologically grounded answer\n\n- Scripture presents a clear, historical anchor for baptism in the Triune name (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) as the normative formula.\n- The occurrences of baptism “in the name of Jesus” in Acts are best understood as:\n  - Statements about the authority of Jesus in baptism, or\n  - Linguistic shorthand used within a specific apostolic context, not as a universal revision of the baptismal formula.\n- The Oneness claim is a substantive doctrinal difference about the nature of God (the Trinity) and about the proper baptismal formula. It is regarded as non-orthodox by the historic creedal confessions of the church, though it should be treated with pastoral respect when engaging in dialogue.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper\n- Key scriptural passages to compare:\n  - Matthew 28:19 (the Triune baptism formula)\n  - Didache 7:1 (explicit triune baptism formula)\n  - Acts 2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5; 22:16 (baptism “in the name of Jesus”)\n  - 1 Corinthians 1:13; 12:13 (references to baptism and identity in Christ/Spirit)\n- Helpful historical context:\n  - Early creeds and church writings on the Trinity (Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed)\n  - Early patristic discussions on baptism and theology of the Godhead\n  - Didache and other ancient baptismal liturgies showing the triune formula\n- Contemporary ecumenical conversations acknowledge the legitimacy of varied expression in language and practice, but the consensus of historic orthodoxy remains the Triune baptism formula as the standard.\n\nIn sum\n Scripture supports baptism into the Triune God, most clearly in Matthew 28:19 and the Didache, with Acts presenting baptism under Jesus’ authority in contexts that emphasize Christ’s lordship. The Oneness “Jesus’ name only” position represents a distinct theological interpretation that diverges from the historic teaching of the church about the Godhead and baptism. The orthodox reading therefore maintains that Trinitarian baptism is the standard and that the Jesus-name passages, while meaningful in their own right, do not authorize a universal replacement of the Triune formula in Scripture.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns well with historic Christian orthodoxy: it properly treats Matthew 28:19 as the core normative formula for baptism (the Trinitarian formula) and cites Didache 7:1 as early corroboration of that triune baptismal practice. It accurately notes Acts’s “in the name of Jesus” formulations as expressions of Christ’s authority or as shorthand within specific contexts, not as a universal universal replacement for the Triune formula. It also reflects that 1 Corinthians 1:13 and related passages describe baptism in terms of allegiance and identity, not as an instruction to alter the baptismal formula. The assessment of Oneness theology as a distinct departure from historic creedal orthodoxy matches mainstream historic Christianity. Nuance is preserved by explaining how the strands relate (authority of Jesus, entry into the Triune God, and how different biblical texts are interpreted in practice). A minor caveat is that some scholars debate subtle textual or historical details of Didache and Acts’ phrasing, and ecumenical humility could be added regarding how different traditions understand “name” language; however, the overall portrayal is accurate and well-grounded."
