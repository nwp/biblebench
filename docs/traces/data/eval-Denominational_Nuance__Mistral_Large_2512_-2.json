    "expected": "Calvinism and Arminianism differ primarily on sovereignty and free will. Calvinists emphasize God's unconditional election, where God chooses who will be saved based solely on His will (TULIP: Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance of saints). Arminians emphasize that God's election is based on foreknowledge of who will freely choose faith, that Christ's atonement is unlimited, that grace can be resisted, and that believers can potentially lose salvation. Both affirm salvation by grace through faith and God's sovereignty, but differ on how divine sovereignty relates to human choice. Both views have been held by orthodox Christians throughout church history.",
    "output": "The differences between **Calvinist** and **Arminian** theology represent one of the most significant debates in Protestant Christianity regarding **salvation, human free will, and God’s sovereignty**. Both systems affirm core orthodox Christian beliefs (e.g., the Trinity, the deity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith) but differ in their understanding of how God’s grace interacts with human choice. Below is a fair and respectful comparison of their key distinctions, grounded in historical confessions and theological reflection.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Historical Background**\n- **Calvinism** (Reformed Theology):\n  - Named after **John Calvin** (1509–1564), though its roots trace back to **Augustine** (4th–5th century) and were systematized by later Reformed theologians like **Theodore Beza** and the **Synod of Dort (1618–1619)**.\n  - Key confessions: **Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)**, **Canons of Dort (1619)**, **Heidelberg Catechism (1563)**.\n  - Dominant in **Presbyterian, Reformed, and some Baptist** traditions.\n\n- **Arminianism**:\n  - Named after **Jacobus Arminius** (1560–1609), a Dutch Reformed theologian who challenged Calvinist predestination.\n  - His followers, the **Remonstrants**, formalized their views in the **Five Articles of Remonstrance (1610)**.\n  - Key confessions: **Remonstrant Confession (1621)**, later adopted in modified forms by **Methodists, Wesleyans, Nazarenes, and some Baptists**.\n  - Influenced by **Erasmus** and **early Church Fathers** like **Chrysostom**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Core Theological Differences**\nThe debate is often summarized using the **\"Five Points\"** of Calvinism (TULIP) and the Arminian response. However, it’s important to note that these points are **not exhaustive** of either system but highlight key contrasts.\n\n| **Doctrine**          | **Calvinist View** | **Arminian View** |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **1. Human Depravity** | **Total Depravity**: Sin has corrupted every aspect of human nature (mind, will, affections). Humans are **spiritually dead** (Eph. 2:1) and **unable to choose God** without grace (Rom. 3:10–12; John 6:44). | **Partial Depravity**: Sin has corrupted humanity, but **not totally**—people retain a **God-given ability to respond to grace** (though they cannot save themselves). Prevenient grace (grace that \"comes before\") enables free will (John 1:9; Rom. 2:4). |\n| **2. Election** | **Unconditional Election**: God chooses individuals for salvation **based solely on His sovereign will**, not foreseen faith or merit (Rom. 9:11–16; Eph. 1:4–5). Election is **not based on human response**. | **Conditional Election**: God elects those whom He **foresees will freely believe** in Christ (Rom. 8:29–30; 1 Pet. 1:1–2). Election is **based on God’s foreknowledge of faith**. |\n| **3. Atonement** | **Limited (Definite) Atonement**: Christ’s death **actually secures salvation** for the elect (John 10:11; Eph. 5:25). His atonement is **efficient**, not merely potential. | **Unlimited Atonement**: Christ died for **all people**, making salvation **possible** for everyone (1 John 2:2; 1 Tim. 2:4–6). His death is **sufficient for all but efficient only for believers**. |\n| **4. Grace** | **Irresistible Grace**: The Holy Spirit **effectually calls** the elect, overcoming their resistance (John 6:37, 44; Acts 13:48). Grace **cannot be ultimately rejected**. | **Resistible Grace**: God’s grace enables faith, but humans **can resist** it (Acts 7:51; Heb. 3:15). Grace is **persuasive, not coercive**. |\n| **5. Perseverance** | **Perseverance of the Saints**: The elect **cannot lose salvation** because God preserves them (John 10:28–29; Phil. 1:6). | **Conditional Security**: Believers **can fall away** from faith (Heb. 6:4–6; 2 Pet. 2:20–22). Salvation requires **continued faith and obedience**. |\n\n---\n\n### **3. Broader Theological Implications**\nBeyond the \"Five Points,\" Calvinism and Arminianism differ in other areas:\n\n#### **A. God’s Sovereignty vs. Human Freedom**\n- **Calvinism**: Emphasizes **God’s absolute sovereignty** in salvation. Human freedom is **compatible with divine determinism** (God ordains all things, including human choices, without violating true freedom).\n- **Arminianism**: Emphasizes **human responsibility and libertarian free will**. God’s sovereignty is **self-limiting**—He chooses to work through human choices rather than overriding them.\n\n#### **B. The Nature of Grace**\n- **Calvinism**: Grace is **monergistic** (God alone acts in salvation; humans are passive recipients).\n- **Arminianism**: Grace is **synergistic** (God initiates, but humans must cooperate with grace).\n\n#### **C. The Extent of the Atonement**\n- **Calvinism**: Christ’s death **actually saves** the elect (not just makes salvation possible).\n- **Arminianism**: Christ’s death **makes salvation possible** for all, but only **applies to believers**.\n\n#### **D. Assurance of Salvation**\n- **Calvinism**: Assurance comes from **God’s unchanging decree** (Rom. 8:30) and the **internal witness of the Spirit** (Rom. 8:16).\n- **Arminianism**: Assurance comes from **continued faith and obedience** (1 John 2:3–6). Believers must **persevere to the end**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Misconceptions**\n- **\"Calvinism denies free will\"**: Calvinists affirm **compatibilist free will**—humans act according to their desires, but God ordains those desires.\n- **\"Arminianism teaches salvation by works\"**: Arminians insist salvation is **by grace alone through faith alone**, but faith must be **living and active** (James 2:17).\n- **\"Calvinism makes God the author of sin\"**: Calvinists distinguish between **God’s decree** (which permits evil) and **His moral will** (which condemns it).\n- **\"Arminianism limits God’s sovereignty\"**: Arminians argue that **God’s sovereignty includes the power to grant genuine free will** to His creatures.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Areas of Agreement**\nDespite differences, both traditions affirm:\n- **Salvation by grace alone** (Eph. 2:8–9).\n- **The necessity of faith in Christ** (John 3:16).\n- **The authority of Scripture** (2 Tim. 3:16).\n- **The Trinity and Christ’s deity** (Nicene Creed).\n- **The need for regeneration** (John 3:3).\n- **The final perseverance of the elect** (though Arminians say this requires **continued faith**).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Pastoral and Practical Implications**\n- **Calvinism**:\n  - Encourages **humility** (salvation is entirely God’s work).\n  - Provides **strong assurance** (God will preserve His people).\n  - Can lead to **fatalism** if misapplied (e.g., \"Why evangelize if God elects?\"—Calvinists respond that God ordains **means** as well as ends).\n\n- **Arminianism**:\n  - Emphasizes **human responsibility** (people must respond to the Gospel).\n  - Encourages **holiness and perseverance** (salvation can be lost).\n  - Can lead to **anxiety** (fear of falling away) or **works-righteousness** if not balanced with grace.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Modern Expressions**\n- **Calvinism**: Strong in **Reformed Baptist** (e.g., John Piper, R.C. Sproul), **Presbyterian** (e.g., Tim Keller), and **Dutch Reformed** (e.g., Abraham Kuyper) circles. Also influential in **Puritan theology** and **New Calvinism** (e.g., David Platt, Matt Chandler).\n- **Arminianism**: Dominant in **Methodism** (John Wesley), **Wesleyan-Holiness** (e.g., Nazarene Church), **Free Will Baptist**, and **many non-denominational evangelical** churches. Also present in **Lutheranism** (though Lutherans have their own distinct views on election).\n\n---\n\n### **8. A Fair-Minded Conclusion**\nBoth Calvinism and Arminianism are **within the bounds of orthodox Christianity** and have deep biblical and theological support. The debate reflects **different emphases** rather than outright contradiction:\n- **Calvinism** stresses **God’s initiative and sovereignty** in salvation.\n- **Arminianism** stresses **human responsibility and God’s universal love**.\n\n**Key Questions for Reflection**:\n- How do we reconcile **God’s sovereignty** with **human freedom**?\n- Is **election based on God’s choice alone**, or does it involve **foreseen faith**?\n- Can a **truly regenerate person** fall away from faith?\n\nBoth traditions seek to honor Scripture while interpreting it through different lenses. **Charity and humility** are essential in dialogue, as both sides affirm the **centrality of Christ’s work** for salvation.\n\nWould you like recommendations for further reading from either perspective?",

            "While the summary of 'Irresistible Grace' reflects traditional Calvinist teaching (as in Dort), the precise binding of God’s grace to irresistibility is debated among Christians and is a point of contention in some streams of theology (the Canons of Dort present it as a category, but many theologians nuance how grace operates in practice)."

It is generally doctrinally sound and nuanced, though it includes mildly oversimplified wording on depravity for Arminians and a historically debatable claim about Erasmus/Chrysostom as direct influentials. These are not fatal errors but worth noting for precision. Overall, the core distinctions are accurately represented and well-supported by Scripture and traditional confessional summaries."

Possible minor biases include framing the discussion primarily around the traditional Five Points framework (while noting it is not exhaustive) and using common Protestant labels (e.g., unconditional/foreseen faith) that reflect traditional debates. It also centers Protestant confessional language and does not engage directly with Catholic or Orthodox perspectives on election, grace, and atonement.
