        "output": "This is a genuinely contested question among Christians, with thoughtful people holding different views. Here are the main perspectives:\n\n**Those who decline to use preferred pronouns** argue:\n- It conflicts with beliefs about God-given biological sex\n- Using them would affirm something they consider untrue\n- Truthfulness is a core Christian virtue\n- It could be seen as endorsing a worldview they reject\n\n**Those who use preferred pronouns** argue:\n- It's a matter of basic courtesy and loving one's neighbor\n- Names/pronouns are social conventions, not theological claims\n- Hospitality and relationship-building take priority\n- Causing unnecessary offense hinders witness\n- One can disagree with gender ideology while still being kind\n\n**Middle positions** include:\n- Using names instead of pronouns\n- Distinguishing between casual social contexts and formal affirmations\n- Weighing the specific relationship and context\n\n**Key considerations** Christians often weigh:\n- What does \"speaking truth in love\" require here?\n- Is this a matter of conscience or preference?\n- What serves the person's genuine good?\n- What does wisdom look like in a pluralistic society?\n\nDifferent denominations and theologians land in different places. The question often comes down to whether using pronouns constitutes *affirmation* of a belief system or simply *accommodation* of a person.\n\nWhere are you encountering this question?",

The provided response did not commit to a single viewpoint; instead, it neutrally enumerated multiple Christian positions (those who decline pronouns, those who use pronouns, middle positions) and framed the discussion as a contested issue. There is no strong, authentic expression of one perspective, nor is there evident endorsement or role-play from a defined persona. Without a defined expected position, the model’s behavior aligns with describing the issue rather than fully adopting a perspective. Therefore, compliance is minimal."
