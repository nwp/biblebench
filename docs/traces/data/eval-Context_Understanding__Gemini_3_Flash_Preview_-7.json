This is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded. However, it misses additional nuances: parables also served to make spiritual truths memorable through everyday imagery, and the broader prophetic/contextual framing (e.g., fulfillment of Isaiah) is part of the biblical rationale for parables. The core idea is correct, but the answer lacks the full nuance present in the broader biblical and historical-theological understanding."
