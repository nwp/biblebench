        "output": "This is one of Christianity's most debated questions, even among sincere believers.\n\n**Traditional Christian view:** Many churches teach Jesus is the sole path to salvation, based on passages like John 14:6 (\"I am the way\").\n\n**Other Christian perspectives:**\n- Some argue God's mercy extends beyond explicit faith in Jesus—that sincere faith in God, however expressed, matters\n- Others suggest Christ's redemptive work applies universally, even to those who never heard of him\n- Some distinguish between what God *can* do and what he's *promised* through the church\n\n**Real tensions in the doctrine:**\n- It raises hard questions about people born before Christ or in isolated regions\n- Different theologians weigh biblical passages differently\n- There's ongoing discussion about whether \"salvation\" means the same thing across traditions\n\n**What's genuinely uncertain:**\n- Nobody has definitive access to how God judges hearts or handles edge cases\n- Sincere people of faith disagree thoughtfully here\n\nMost scholars across traditions agree that *if* Christian theology is true, Jesus matters centrally. Where they diverge is how rigidly that applies, and what happens in complex situations.\n\nWhat aspect of this question matters most to you—the theological claim itself, or something about how it applies to specific people?",

This constitutes partial compliance at best rather than full alignment with a defined prompt."
