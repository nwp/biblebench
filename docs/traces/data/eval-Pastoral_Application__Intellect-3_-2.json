    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "My dear friends, thank you for your honesty and for seeking counsel. It takes courage to bring these questions into the light, and I'm grateful you trust me enough to share. Your commitment to each other is a beautiful thing – God designed us for deep, covenantal relationships, and it's clear you value the bond of marriage. That heart posture is something to be commended.\n\nNow, let's gently explore this together through the lens of Scripture and God's design.\n\n1.  **God's Design for Sexuality and Covenant:** The Bible consistently presents sexual intimacy as a profound gift, but one *reserved for the covenant commitment of marriage*. Consider:\n    *   **1 Corinthians 6:18-20:** \"Flee from sexual immorality... Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit...? Therefore honor God with your bodies.\" Living together outside of marriage creates a significant environment for sexual temptation, which Scripture calls us to actively *flee*, not casually inhabit.\n    *   **Hebrews 13:4:** \"Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.\" The \"marriage bed\" is defined within the context of the marriage covenant itself.\n    *   **Genesis 2:24:** \"That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.\" This \"one flesh\" union, established by God, is the context He ordained for sexual union. Cohabitation often attempts to achieve the *experience* of this union (\"one flesh\" intimacy) *before* entering into the *covenant* (\"leaves... united to his wife\") God established for it.\n\n2.  **The Nature of Commitment vs. Covenant:** You speak of being \"committed.\" That's wonderful! But God's design for marriage is more than commitment; it's a sacred, public covenant before God and His people. Cohabitation, even with deep commitment, lacks the God-ordained structure, public accountability, and spiritual covering that marriage provides. It's like building a house on shifting sand instead of the rock (Matthew 7:24-27) – the foundation matters immensely for the storms of life.\n\n3.  **Cultural Norms vs. Biblical Standards:** \"Everyone does it now\" reflects the world's shifting standards (Romans 12:2). God's Word doesn't change with cultural trends. While societal acceptance might ease practical concerns, it doesn't alter God's design or the potential spiritual consequences. We are called to be holy, set apart for God's purposes (1 Peter 1:13-16), not conformed to the patterns of the world.\n\n4.  **Practical and Spiritual Challenges:** Beyond the theological, living together presents real hurdles:\n    *   **Increased Temptation:** Constant proximity makes avoiding sexual sin significantly harder.\n    *   **Erosion of Purity:** The \"slippery slope\" is real. What starts as \"just sleeping over\" often leads to compromised boundaries.\n    *   **Hindered Spiritual Growth:** Sin (including sexual immorality) grieves the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 4:30) and can create a barrier to experiencing God's fullness (Psalm 66:18). It can also create distance in your relationship with God and each other.\n    *   **Lack of God's Best:** God's plan isn't to restrict joy but to provide the *safest, most blessed* context for intimacy, commitment, and family. Cohabitation often short-circuits the journey towards that best.\n\n**A Path Forward with Grace and Truth:**\n\n*   **Acknowledge the Struggle:** Recognizing the tension between your desire for intimacy/commitment and God's standard is the first step. Don't dismiss the struggle, but bring it to the cross.\n*   **Repentance and Renewal:** If you've been sexually active, the beautiful message of the Gospel is that forgiveness and a fresh start are available through Christ (1 John 1:9). Repentance means turning away *from* the behavior and *towards* God's design. This might involve practical separation.\n*   **Practical Steps:**\n    *   **Separate Living Arrangements:** This is often the most challenging but necessary step to honor God with your bodies and create space for purity. It removes the primary environment of temptation.\n    *   **Establish Clear Boundaries:** If you visit each other, ensure visits are purposeful (with others present, during daylight hours initially) and avoid situations that invite temptation. Be accountable to each other and a trusted mature Christian (or couple).\n    *   **Pursue Premarital Counseling:** *If* you are genuinely moving towards marriage, engage in thorough, biblically-based premarital counseling *now*. Use this time apart to focus on building a Christ-centered foundation *before* the pressures of cohabitation begin.\n    *   **Reaffirm Your Vows (If Engaged):** If you are already formally engaged, consider reaffirming your commitment to sexual purity until marriage. Make this a shared covenant before God.\n    *   **Seek Accountability:** Connect regularly with a mature Christian friend or mentor who will ask difficult questions and pray with you.\n*   **Focus on the \"Why\":** Remember *why* God set these boundaries: for your protection, your holiness, and His glory. He knows the path that leads to true life and blessing (John 10:10). Trust His wisdom even when it's countercultural.\n*   **Extend Grace to Yourselves:** This is a journey. If you stumble, don't despair. The key is to get back up, confess, receive forgiveness, and recommit to obedience. God's grace is sufficient (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\n**In Closing:** My dear friends, your desire for a lifelong commitment is good. But God invites you to pursue it within the boundaries He lovingly set for your good and His glory. Living together before marriage, while culturally common, falls short of God's standard for sexual purity and covenant relationship. It creates unnecessary obstacles to the spiritual depth and blessing God desires for your marriage.\n\nI strongly encourage you to prayerfully consider separating your living arrangements. Use this time to deepen your individual relationships with Christ, strengthen your commitment to purity, and prepare diligently for the covenant of marriage – not just practically, but spiritually. This path requires sacrifice, but it leads to a foundation built on the Rock, a marriage bed kept pure, and the deep, abiding joy of walking in God's will together. Let's pray about this and seek wisdom together. You are loved, and God has an incredible plan for your union when it's rooted in His ways.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns closely with biblical teaching and historic Christian orthodoxy. It correctly grounds its guidance in key Scriptures about sexual purity (1 Corinthians 6:18-20), the honor and purity of the marriage bed (Hebrews 13:4), and the Genesis framework for marriage (Genesis 2:24). It emphasizes the difference between personal commitment and the God-ordained covenant of marriage and notes that culture does not determine biblical standards. The answer also addresses practical and spiritual aspects (temptation, accountability, holiness, forgiveness) and offers a Grace-and-Truth pathway (repentance, potential separation, premarital counseling, accountability) that is consistent with pastoral practice. Nuance is shown by distinguishing covenantal design from mere commitment, acknowledging cultural pressures, and highlighting the protective purposes of God’s boundaries (purity, flourishing, unity in marriage). A minor potential area for improvement would be to acknowledge that pastoral approaches can vary among traditions or couples in different circumstances; the response could note that some contexts may require tailored guidance beyond a uniform recommendation to separate. Overall, the response is strong: biblically grounded, doctrinally sound, and nuanced."
