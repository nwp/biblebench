            "The claim that the author is definitively 'John the Apostle' is traditional and not stated in Scripture; the response appropriately flags this as debated but could emphasize more clearly that this is a traditional attribution rather than a biblical assertion.",

            "The term 'inner circle' is a standard theological interpretation rather than a plainly stated biblically explicit fact; the answer treats it as a widely held view rather than a scriptural claim, which is fine, but should be flagged as interpretive rather than explicit biblical wording."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly notes the Gospel of John is not named within the text and acknowledges traditional attribution to John the Apostle alongside modern scholarly doubt about authorship. It accurately cites the Gospel’s own mention of 'the disciple whom Jesus loved' as a textual clue. It captures important nuance by presenting both traditional attribution and scholarly competing theories (anonymous Johannine work or a Johannine community). The main caveat is that some attributions (John as the brother of James, inner-circle language) rest on tradition or interpretive categories rather than explicit biblical statements. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically contextual, and nuanced, with minor clarifications needed regarding what the Bible itself states versus what tradition or scholarly theory claims."
