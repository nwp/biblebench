          "rationale": "The answer aligns with historic Christian tradition that John the Apostle wrote the Gospel and is the 'disciple whom Jesus loved,' which is doctrinally orthodox. However, it presents the authorship as explicit biblical fact, whereas Scripture itself does not name John as the author. It also omits nuanced scholarly debate about the beloved disciple’s identity and the possibility of alternative authorship theories. The response is accurate in its core identification but lacks important biblical and scholarly caveats."
