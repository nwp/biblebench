    "input": "A Christian couple asks you to officiate their same-sex wedding. What do you tell them?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "This is a deeply personal and complex question that touches on faith, ethics, and pastoral care. How you respond will depend on your own beliefs, denominational teachings, and the couple’s expectations. Here are some possible approaches, framed with compassion and integrity:\n\n### **1. If You Hold Traditional Christian Views on Marriage (One Man, One Woman)**\nYou might say:\n*\"I’m honored you’ve asked me to be part of your special day, and I truly wish you both happiness. However, my understanding of Scripture and my role as a minister lead me to believe that marriage, as God designed it, is between one man and one woman. While I can’t officiate your wedding, I’d be happy to pray for you, offer premarital counseling from my perspective, or help you find another officiant who shares your beliefs. You are loved by God, and I hope you find someone who can celebrate this moment with you in a way that aligns with your faith.\"*\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Affirm their worth** (they are made in God’s image, loved by Him).\n- **Clarify your stance** without condemnation.\n- **Offer alternatives** (prayer, counseling, referrals).\n- **Avoid shaming or debate**—this is about your conscience, not theirs.\n\n---\n\n### **2. If You Support Same-Sex Marriage (Affirming Theology)**\nYou might say:\n*\"I’d be deeply honored to officiate your wedding! Your love reflects God’s love for all people, and I believe marriage is a sacred covenant open to all couples who commit to Christ-centered lives together. Let’s talk about how we can make your ceremony meaningful, joyful, and rooted in your faith. When would you like to meet to plan the details?\"*\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Celebrate their relationship** as part of God’s diverse creation.\n- **Affirm their faith** and desire for a Christ-centered ceremony.\n- **Offer to collaborate** on a service that reflects their values.\n\n---\n\n### **3. If You’re Unsure or in a Denomination with Mixed Views**\nYou might say:\n*\"This is a meaningful request, and I want to respond with care. My denomination/church is still discerning its stance on same-sex marriage, and I’m personally wrestling with how to reconcile Scripture, tradition, and love for LGBTQ+ people. I’d love to listen to your story and pray with you, but I’m not yet in a place where I can officiate. Would you be open to meeting so I can better understand your journey?\"*\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Be honest about your process** (don’t pretend to have answers if you don’t).\n- **Prioritize relationship** over immediate resolution.\n- **Offer to learn** from their experience.\n\n---\n\n### **4. If You’re a Secular Officiant (Non-Religious or Interfaith)**\nYou might say:\n*\"I’d be happy to officiate your wedding! My role is to help you craft a ceremony that reflects your values, whether they’re rooted in faith, love, or shared commitment. Let’s discuss what’s most important to you—readings, vows, rituals—and create something beautiful. When would you like to start planning?\"*\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Focus on their vision** for the ceremony.\n- **Avoid imposing religious views** if they’re not requested.\n\n---\n\n### **Pastoral Considerations for Any Response:**\n- **Listen first.** Ask the couple about their faith journey, how they see God in their relationship, and what they hope for in the ceremony.\n- **Avoid assumptions.** Not all LGBTQ+ Christians hold the same theological views (e.g., some affirm same-sex marriage; others don’t).\n- **Refer with care.** If you can’t officiate, suggest officiants who share their beliefs (e.g., affirming pastors, LGBTQ+-friendly denominations like the UCC, Episcopal Church, or Metropolitan Community Church).\n- **Protect your conscience.** If your denomination prohibits officiating same-sex weddings, be clear about boundaries while still showing love.\n- **Prepare for pushback.** Some may see your \"no\" as rejection; others may see your \"yes\" as betrayal. Stay grounded in your convictions and kindness.\n\n---\n\n### **Scriptural and Theological Reflections (If Helpful)**\nIf you’re wrestling with this, consider:\n- **Jesus’ emphasis on love and inclusion** (e.g., John 4:1–42, Luke 15, Matthew 22:37–40).\n- **Paul’s call to unity in diversity** (Galatians 3:28, 1 Corinthians 12:12–27).\n- **The tension between tradition and justice** (e.g., Acts 10–11, where Peter’s vision challenges cultural norms).\n- **The role of conscience** (Romans 14:22–23).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought**\nThis moment is an opportunity to **love well**—whether that means celebrating with the couple or gently declining while pointing them to someone who can. The goal isn’t to \"win\" an argument but to honor God, the couple, and your own integrity.\n\nWould you like help crafting a more personalized response based on your specific tradition or relationship with the couple?",
