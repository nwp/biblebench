    "output": "# Why Jesus Used Parables in His Teaching\n\n## The Stated Purpose\n\nJesus himself addressed this question directly when his disciples asked him in **Matthew 13:10-17** (parallel passages in Mark 4:10-12 and Luke 8:9-10). His answer reveals multiple purposes:\n\n### 1. **To Reveal Truth to Receptive Hearts**\nParables served as vehicles of revelation for those genuinely seeking truth. Jesus said the \"mysteries of the kingdom of heaven\" were given to his disciples to know (Matthew 13:11). The stories made abstract spiritual concepts concrete and memorable.\n\n### 2. **To Conceal Truth from Hardened Hearts**\nParadoxically, Jesus also indicated parables obscured meaning from those who had already rejected him: *\"Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand\"* (Matthew 13:13). This fulfilled Isaiah 6:9-10, suggesting parables were partly an act of judgment on willful unbelief.\n\n### 3. **To Provoke Thought and Response**\nParables required listeners to engage actively rather than passively receive information. They forced a decision—would the hearer pursue understanding or walk away?\n\n## Additional Scholarly Observations\n\n- **Pedagogical effectiveness**: Stories are easier to remember than abstract propositions\n- **Cultural appropriateness**: Rabbinic teaching commonly used *mashalim* (parables/proverbs)\n- **Self-protective**: Indirect teaching sometimes avoided premature confrontation with authorities\n- **Prophetic tradition**: Parables connected Jesus to Old Testament prophetic methods (cf. Nathan's parable to David, 2 Samuel 12)",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly cites Matthew 13:10-17 and parallel passages (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10) and accurately describes the twofold purpose: (1) revealing the mysteries of the kingdom to receptive hearers (to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven), and (2) obscuring understanding for those outside who resist or do not understand, fulfilled by Isaiah 6:9-10. It also notes that parables provoke active engagement and recalls related scholarly observations (pedagogical effectiveness of stories, Rabbinic Mashal usage, and prophetic parallels such as Nathan’s parable to David). The answer is relevant to the question and offers nuanced points about interpretation and context (e.g., “self-protective” indirect teaching; ambiguity about insiders vs. outsiders). Minor caveats: some phrasing—such as equating “those outside” strictly with those who rejected Jesus—simplifies a nuanced debate, and the degree to which parables served as judgment versus teaching can be debated among scholars. Overall, the response is accurate, complete for the question, and appropriately nuanced."
