    "output": "# Why Jesus Used Parables in His Teaching\n\n## The Biblical Explanation\n\nJesus himself addressed this question directly when his disciples asked him in **Matthew 13:10-17** (paralleled in Mark 4:10-12 and Luke 8:9-10). His answer reveals multiple purposes:\n\n### 1. **To Reveal Truth to Receptive Hearts**\nParables served as vehicles for revealing \"the secrets of the kingdom of heaven\" to those genuinely seeking truth (Matthew 13:11). For receptive listeners, these stories illuminated profound spiritual realities.\n\n### 2. **To Conceal Truth from Hardened Hearts**\nParadoxically, Jesus indicated that parables also obscured meaning from those who had already rejected him. He quoted Isaiah 6:9-10 about people who \"seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear\" (Matthew 13:13). This reflects a judicial aspect—those who persistently refused the truth would find it increasingly hidden.\n\n### 3. **To Fulfill Prophecy**\nMatthew notes this fulfilled Psalm 78:2: \"I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world\" (Matthew 13:35).\n\n## Practical and Pedagogical Reasons\n\n- **Memorable**: Stories stick in memory better than abstract teaching\n- **Accessible**: Agricultural and domestic imagery connected with ordinary people\n- **Disarming**: Parables could bypass listeners' defenses (as Nathan's parable did with David)\n- **Provocative**: They invited reflection and self-examination\n- **Safe**: In a politically charged environment, indirect speech offered some protection",

It also correctly notes Matthew 13:35’s quotation of Psalm 78:2 as a basis for the claim that Jesus spoke in parables to reveal things hidden from old. The answer adds plausible pedagogical reasons (memorable, accessible imagery, provocative/reflection-inviting, safe in a volatile context) and mentions prophecy fulfillment, which aligns with scholarly presentation. The analogy to Nathan’s parable is a reasonable rhetorical point, though not essential to the historical claim. Minor textual wording differences between Psalm 78:2 and Matthew 13:35 exist across translations (e.g., “dark sayings of old” vs. “things hidden since the foundation of the world”), but these do not undermine accuracy. Overall, the response covers the core facts and provides appropriate contextual nuance without overreaching into speculative interpretation."
