            "The claim that parables 'disarmed hostile listeners' is an interpretive flourish not explicitly stated in Scripture; some parables provoke opposition or confusion rather than disarm it.",
            "The phrasing 'receptive hearts vs. those who rejected him' can be read as an absolute dichotomy. Scripture presents a more nuanced dynamic where some hear and believe, some hear and stumble, and others remain unreceptive or partially receptive. The broader point—that parables reveal truth to the open and obscure it to the hard-hearted—remains accurate, but the binary framing should be softened."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response correctly cites Matthew 13:11-13 (the disciples’ understanding of mysteries vs. others receiving with a parabolic form) and the Isaiah/prophetic language about seeing and hearing. It accurately notes that parables make truths concrete and memorable and references Psalm 78:2 as the scriptural basis for Jesus’ use of parables in fulfilling prophecy (as Matthew 13:35 presents). The main strengths are alignment with biblical passages and the general function of parables in teaching and revelation. The main area for caution is an overgeneral or absolute phrasing about 'disarming hostile listeners' and the strict dichotomy of 'receptive vs. rejecting'—the NT presents a more nuanced spectrum of receptivity and reactions to Jesus’ teaching. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and captures key nuances, with minor interpretive looseness in a couple of claims."
