    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",
    "output": "### Spiritual Gifts in Christian Theology\n\nSpiritual gifts (Greek: *charismata*) are special abilities given by the Holy Spirit to believers for the edification of the church, as described in passages like 1 Corinthians 12:4-11, Romans 12:6-8, and Ephesians 4:11-13. These include \"ordinary\" gifts like teaching, encouragement, mercy, and administration, as well as more \"extraordinary\" or \"sign\" gifts such as prophecy, tongues, interpretation of tongues, healing, and miracles. All orthodox Christians affirm that the Holy Spirit sovereignly distributes these gifts for the common good, emphasizing love as the greatest virtue (1 Corinthians 13:1-3). Disagreement arises over whether the sign gifts continue today or ceased in the early church.\n\nThe primary divide is between **cessationists** (common in Reformed, Baptist, and some Presbyterian and Lutheran traditions) and **continuationists**, particularly **Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians** (including Assemblies of God, Vineyard, and charismatics within Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, and mainline Protestant groups). Both views uphold core orthodox beliefs like the inspiration and authority of Scripture, the deity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, and the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit. The debate centers on biblical interpretation and church history, not fundamentals of the faith.\n\n#### Cessationist Perspective\nCessationists believe that the sign gifts (apostleship, prophecy, tongues, miracles, healing) were temporary, given primarily during the apostolic era (first century AD) to authenticate the apostles' message, establish the church, and confirm the New Testament revelation before its completion. Once the canon was closed (around the end of the first century), these gifts ceased, though non-miraculous gifts continue.\n\n- **Key Biblical Support**:\n  - 1 Corinthians 13:8-10: \"Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away... but when completeness [or 'the perfect'] comes, what is in part disappears.\" Cessationists interpret \"the perfect\" as the completed New Testament canon, after which partial revelation (prophecy, tongues) ended.\n  - Hebrews 2:3-4: Miracles confirmed the gospel message initially, implying a foundational role.\n  - Historical evidence: Sign gifts are sparsely attested in reliable post-apostolic church fathers (e.g., after ~AD 100), with a decline noted by figures like Augustine (who later recanted some miraculous claims).\n\n- **Implications**: Modern claims of tongues or prophecy are viewed skeptically, often as emotional excess, learned behavior, or counterfeit. The focus shifts to Scripture sufficiency (sola scriptura) and ordinary means of grace (preaching, sacraments). Prominent cessationists include John Calvin, Jonathan Edwards (selectively), and contemporaries like John MacArthur and R.C. Sproul.\n\nCessationists respect Pentecostals' zeal for the Spirit but caution against potential abuses, urging discernment (1 John 4:1).\n\n#### Charismatic/Pentecostal Perspective\nContinuationists, especially Pentecostals and charismatics, affirm that *all* spiritual gifts, including sign gifts, remain available today until Christ's return. They see these as normative for empowering the church's mission, with a distinct experience of \"baptism in the Holy Spirit\" (post-conversion) often evidenced by speaking in tongues (Acts 2:4; 10:46; 19:6).\n\n- **Key Biblical Support**:\n  - 1 Corinthians 1:7 and 13:8-12: Gifts cease only \"when Christ appears\" (\"the perfect\" as the second coming, not the canon), as face-to-face knowledge awaits eternity.\n  - Joel 2:28-32 (quoted in Acts 2:17-21): Pouring out of the Spirit \"in the last days\" (ongoing church age) includes prophecies, visions, and dreams.\n  - No explicit biblical command for gifts to stop; commands to \"earnestly desire\" them (1 Corinthians 14:1, 39) apply today. Acts shows gifts beyond apostles (e.g., Stephen, Philip).\n\n- **Implications**: Tongues is a private prayer language (1 Corinthians 14:2-4) and public sign with interpretation. Prophecy is fallible encouragement (not equal to Scripture), tested by the church. Healings and miracles glorify God and advance the gospel globally (e.g., in missions). Pentecostals emphasize Spirit-led worship, while charismatics integrate this into broader traditions. Key figures include early Pentecostals like Charles Parham and modern leaders like Wayne Grudem.\n\nThey honor cessationists' commitment to Scripture but argue history shows revivals (e.g., Azusa Street, 1906) restoring biblical patterns, countering any \"decline\" narrative.\n\n#### Points of Overlap and Respectful Dialogue\n- **Shared Commitments**: Both prioritize church edification, orderly worship (1 Corinthians 14:40), testing all things (1 Thessalonians 5:20-21), and the supremacy of love. Neither denies the Spirit's ongoing fruit (Galatians 5:22-23) or power for holiness.\n- **Debated Passages**: 1 Corinthians 13:10 is pivotal; context (partial vs. complete revelation) allows diverse readings.\n- **Orthodox Unity**: This is a secondary issue (*adiaphora*), not dividing the visible church. Ecumenical efforts (e.g., Lausanne Covenant) affirm mutual learning—cessationists from charismatic vitality, continuationists from doctrinal rigor.\n\nIn summary, cessationists see sign gifts as foundational and fulfilled, securing Scripture's authority, while charismatics/Pentecostals view them as ongoing equipment for mission until Christ's return. Both perspectives enrich the body of Christ, modeling humility amid diversity (Ephesians 4:13). For deeper study, consult B.B. Warfield (*Counterfeit Miracles*, cessationist) or Sam Storms (*The Beginner's Guide to Spiritual Gifts*, continuationist).",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer is largely accurate, balancing cessationist and continuationist viewpoints with biblical references and historical notes. It correctly identifies core gifts, a few key scriptures, and the main axes of disagreement. However, there are some factual and interpretive slips (notably about Augustine, Edwards’ stance, and the precise interpretation of “the perfect”) and a need for fuller nuance around hermeneutical diversity within both camps. These issues prevent a perfect score but the overall theological framing and engagement with Scripture are solid."
