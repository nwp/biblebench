    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "Excellent and foundational theological question. As a theologian, I will analyze this through the lens of historic Christian orthodoxy, drawing upon the ecumenical creeds and the consensus of the major Christian traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant).\n\n### **The Core of the Analysis: The \"Line\" of Orthodoxy**\n\nThe line between a heterodox (deviating) Christian group and one that falls entirely outside orthodox Christianity is not drawn on the basis of practices, church governance, worship style, or even most behavioral and moral teachings. The line is drawn at the **core doctrines concerning the nature of God, the Person and work of Christ, and the means of salvation.**\n\nHistorically, the boundary markers of orthodoxy have been defined by the **ecumenical creeds**, particularly the **Apostles' Creed** and the **Nicene Creed**. These were formulated in the early centuries of the Church to defend the essential gospel against serious distortions.\n\n---\n\n### **Primary Criteria Placing a Group Outside Orthodox Christianity**\n\nA group that uses Christian language but departs from orthodox Christianity will typically deny or fundamentally redefine one or more of the following:\n\n1.  **The Doctrine of the Trinity (The Nature of God):** Orthodox Christianity affirms one God eternally existing in three co-equal, co-eternal, consubstantial persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. A group that denies this—by claiming the Son is a created being (as Arianism did), that the persons are merely modes of one person (Modalism), or that they are three separate gods (Tritheism)—departs from orthodoxy.\n    *   *Example:* Jehovah's Witnesses teach that Jesus is a created being (the archangel Michael) and the Holy Spirit is an impersonal force. This is a rejection of the Trinity and the full deity of Christ and the Spirit.\n\n2.  **The Person of Jesus Christ (Christology):** Orthodoxy affirms the Chalcedonian Definition (451 AD): that Jesus Christ is one person with two natures, fully God and fully man, without confusion, change, division, or separation. Denying either his true divinity or his true humanity undermines the work of salvation.\n    *   *Example:* Classical Liberalism that views Jesus solely as a moral teacher and not as the divine Son of God departs from orthodoxy. Similarly, doctrines that claim Jesus was not fully human (like some early Gnostic groups) also fall outside.\n\n3.  **The Work of Christ and Salvation by Grace (Soteriology):** The orthodox gospel declares that sinful humanity is reconciled to God solely through the atoning death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, received by grace through faith. This is a finished work of Christ, offered as a free gift.\n    *   *Example:* Any system that adds human works, rituals, or obedience as a *necessary precondition* for receiving justification (as opposed to a fruit of it) departs from the gospel of grace. If a group teaches that salvation is earned by membership, exclusive obedience to their organization, or extra-Christian rituals, it moves outside orthodoxy. The Mormon teaching of \"exaltation\" through progressive obedience is a key example.\n\n4.  **The Authority of Scripture:** While interpretations vary widely, orthodox Christianity holds the 66 books of the Bible (accepted by Protestants, Catholics, and Orthodox, with the addition of the Deuterocanon in Catholic/Orthodox traditions) as the inspired, authoritative, and sufficient written revelation of God, the final norm for faith and practice.\n    *   *Example:* A group that places a new revelation or the teachings of a modern leader on equal or superior authority to the closed biblical canon, and reinterprets the Bible through that lens, has established a new foundation. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) with its *Book of Mormon*, *Doctrine and Covenants*, and *Pearl of Great Price*, and Christian Science with *Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures* by Mary Baker Eddy, are clear examples.\n\n5.  **The Physical Resurrection and Bodily Return of Christ:** Orthodoxy affirms the literal, physical resurrection of Jesus from the dead and his future, personal, visible return in glory. Spiritualizing or allegorizing these events into non-historical symbols often accompanies a departure from orthodoxy.\n\n### **Areas of Internal Disagreement *Within* Orthodoxy**\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish the above \"boundary markers\" from issues that Christians have debated *within* the bounds of orthodoxy for centuries. These do not place a group outside of Christianity:\n*   **Church governance:** Episcopal, presbyterian, or congregational polity.\n*   **Mode of baptism:** Immersion, pouring, or sprinkling.\n*   **The nature of the Lord's Supper:** Transubstantiation, spiritual presence, or memorialism.\n*   **Eschatological timelines:** Premillennial, amillennial, postmillennial views.\n*   **The operation of spiritual gifts:** Cessationist versus continuationist views.\n*   **Specific styles of worship.**\n\n### **Application to Contemporary Groups**\n\nUsing this framework:\n*   **Groups Typically Considered Outside Orthodoxy:** Jehovah's Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), The Way International, Christian Science, Oneness Pentecostalism (which denies the Trinity), and Unitarianism (which rejects Christ's divinity). These groups fail one or more of the primary criteria above.\n*   **Groups Within the Orthodox Spectrum (despite significant disagreements):** Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and all major Protestant traditions (Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Lutheran, Anglican, etc.). Their disagreements, while profound, occur on issues that, historically, are not considered salvific foundations like the Trinity and the Person of Christ.\n\n### **A Pastoral and Respectful Conclusion**\n\nDrawing these lines is not about judging hearts or claiming who is \"saved.\" That is God's prerogative. It is a theological task of **discernment**, crucial for clarity in teaching, evangelism, and ecumenical dialogue.\n\nWe can and should engage with those in groups outside orthodoxy with **respect and grace**, recognizing their sincere use of Christian language and moral seriousness. However, theological honesty requires acknowledging that foundational differences exist. The goal of such analysis is not to malign but to clarify, so that dialogue can be truthful and the distinct claims of the historic Christian gospel can be understood.\n\n**In summary:** The line is drawn at the essential, ecumenically creedal doctrines concerning the Triune God, the fully divine and human Christ, salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, and the final authority of the Christian Scriptures. When these are denied or fundamentally redefined, a group, regardless of its use of Christian terminology, places itself outside the historic, orthodox Christian faith.",

It also sensibly notes that there is internal disagreement within orthodoxy on non-essentials and advocates pastoral engagement. However, it contains a notable imprecision about the biblical canon and the normative authority of Scripture across traditions, which slightly undermines biblical grounding. Overall, it aligns well with historic orthodoxy but would benefit from precise treatment of canon and tradition."
