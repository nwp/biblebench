    "input": "What does the Bible teach about homosexuality? Are homosexual relationships sinful, or is the biblical prohibition limited to exploitative contexts?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "The Bible speaks to same-sex sexual behavior in a small number of texts, but Christians disagree about how those texts apply today—especially whether they condemn all same-sex sexual relationships or primarily abusive/exploitative forms common in the ancient world. A balanced answer has to (1) name the key passages, (2) describe the main interpretive options, and (3) note how broader biblical themes (creation, covenant, holiness, sin and grace) shape Christian moral reasoning.\n\n## 1) What passages are usually in view?\n\n### Old Testament\n- **Leviticus 18:22; 20:13** prohibit a man “lying with a male as with a woman” within Israel’s holiness code.\n- **Genesis 19 (Sodom)** is sometimes cited, though many scholars note the story’s central sin is **violent attempted rape and inhospitality**, not a consensual relationship (cf. **Ezekiel 16:49–50**).\n\n### New Testament\n- **Romans 1:26–27** describes same-sex relations as part of humanity’s disordered worship and passions.\n- **1 Corinthians 6:9–11** and **1 Timothy 1:9–10** include disputed terms (notably **malakoi** and **arsenokoitai**) in vice lists.\n- **Jesus** does not address homosexuality explicitly, but he does reaffirm a male–female marital pattern when discussing divorce (**Matthew 19:4–6**, citing **Genesis 1–2**).\n\n## 2) The “traditional” (non-affirming) reading\nThis is the majority view across historic Catholic, Orthodox, and many Protestant traditions.\n\n### Core claim\nThe Bible consistently presents sex as rightly ordered to a **covenantal union of man and woman** (often connected to creation, kinship, and procreation), and therefore **same-sex sexual acts** are outside that design and are sinful—regardless of whether they are exploitative or loving.\n\n### How traditional interpreters argue from Scripture\n1. **Creation and marriage as a norm:** Genesis 1–2 presents male–female union (“one flesh”) as the foundational pattern; Jesus appeals to this pattern in Matthew 19.\n2. **Leviticus as moral, not merely ceremonial:** While Christians do not keep all of Leviticus (dietary laws, etc.), many argue sexual prohibitions reflect enduring moral norms (often grouped with incest/adultery in Lev 18).\n3. **Romans 1 as broadly framed:** Romans 1 appears to describe same-sex relations in general terms (“men with men,” “women with women”), not limited explicitly to prostitution or pederasty.\n4. **Arsenokoitai likely echoes Leviticus:** Many scholars think **arsenokoitai** (1 Cor 6; 1 Tim 1) is coined from the Greek of Leviticus (arsen = male, koitē = bed), suggesting a broad reference to male–male intercourse.\n\n### Typical ethical conclusion\n- **Same-sex attraction** itself is not usually labeled sin in this view; sin concerns **sexual behavior**.  \n- The call is to chastity: either male–female marriage or celibacy.\n\n## 3) The “affirming/contextual” reading\nThis view is held by some Protestant denominations and theologians, and it often distinguishes between the Bible’s condemnation of certain same-sex acts and the modern idea of a committed, mutual same-sex marriage.\n\n### Core claim\nThe biblical prohibitions address **specific practices** (exploitation, idolatry, domination, pederasty, prostitution, excessive lust) rather than **covenantal, faithful, same-sex unions** as understood today. Therefore, committed same-sex relationships may not fall under what Scripture condemns.\n\n### How affirming interpreters argue from Scripture\n1. **Ancient context differs from modern “orientation” and marriage:** The Bible does not discuss lifelong, egalitarian same-sex marriages as a social institution; it addresses acts within cultures where same-sex behavior was often tied to status, domination, cultic practice, or exploitation.\n2. **Sodom is about violence, not orientation:** Genesis 19 is read as condemning attempted rape and abusive power, reinforced by Ezekiel 16’s critique of pride and injustice.\n3. **Leviticus and cultural boundary markers:** Some argue Leviticus reflects Israel’s distinctiveness and purity symbolism, and that Christians must be cautious about directly transferring those laws without considering how the New Testament reconfigures Torah observance.\n4. **Disputed meanings in vice lists:**  \n   - **malakoi** can mean “soft” and may refer to moral weakness or (in some readings) male prostitution.  \n   - **arsenokoitai** is rare; some suggest it could target economic or coercive sex (e.g., exploitative relations), though this is debated.\n5. **Romans 1 read as condemning idolatry-driven excess:** Some interpret Romans 1 as describing lustful, excessive, or idolatrous practices (possibly involving people acting “against their nature” in the sense of against their personal disposition), rather than loving covenants.\n\n### Typical ethical conclusion\n- Same-sex relationships characterized by **mutuality, fidelity, and covenantal commitment** can be morally permissible, while exploitative or promiscuous sexuality is condemned (as for heterosexuals).\n\n## 4) Where the disagreement really sits\nThe debate is not merely about “exploitative vs. loving.” It is also about:\n- **Whether Genesis 1–2 functions as a universal sexual ethic** binding for Christians in the same way it is used by Jesus and Paul.\n- **How to weigh continuity/discontinuity between Old Testament sexual laws and Christian moral teaching.**\n- **What Paul’s language most plausibly refers to** in Romans 1 and the vice lists.\n- **How the church discerns moral development** (e.g., parallels some draw with slavery or women’s roles—though others reject these parallels as inapplicable).\n\n## 5) A careful summary answer\n- **Yes, the Bible contains explicit prohibitions of male–male sexual intercourse (Leviticus) and critiques of same-sex sexual behavior (Romans 1; likely also 1 Cor 6 and 1 Tim 1).**  \n- **Most historic Christian interpretation concludes that homosexual sexual acts are sinful, not only when exploitative, because Scripture frames sex within male–female marriage as a creational norm.**\n- **Some Christians argue those texts are aimed at abusive, idolatrous, or otherwise disordered practices prevalent in the ancient world and do not directly address modern committed same-sex unions; therefore, they conclude that faithful same-sex marriages can be consistent with Christian discipleship.**\n\n## 6) Pastoral and practical note\nWhatever one concludes, the New Testament’s posture toward sinners is neither denial nor contempt: it is truth-telling joined to mercy, repentance, and a shared call to holiness (e.g., **1 Corinthians 6:11** emphasizes transformation and belonging). Churches that disagree on this issue often still agree that:\n- sexual ethics matter,\n- exploitation and coercion are grievous sins,\n- every person bears God’s image and must be treated with dignity,\n- discipleship involves costly faithfulness for all, not a singled-out burden for one group.\n\nIf you tell me your church tradition (Catholic/Orthodox/evangelical/mainline, etc.) or whether you’re asking for personal discipleship guidance versus academic interpretation, I can tailor the answer more specifically.",
