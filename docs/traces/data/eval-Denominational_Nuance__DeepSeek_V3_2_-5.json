    "expected": "Pentecostals and charismatics believe all spiritual gifts including tongues, prophecy, and healing continue today as the Spirit wills. They emphasize personal experience of the Spirit's power and often practice contemporary manifestations. Cessationists believe certain 'sign gifts' ceased with the apostolic age, as they served to authenticate apostolic ministry and Scripture. They emphasize gifts like teaching, service, and mercy continue. Both agree the Holy Spirit is active today and gives gifts to believers, but differ on which gifts continue and how prominently they should feature in church life. Both positions are held by Bible-believing Christians.",
    "output": "Of course. This is a central and defining area of theological difference within Christianity, grounded in divergent interpretations of Scripture regarding the work of the Holy Spirit. Here is a fair-minded explanation of the charismatic/Pentecostal and cessationist perspectives on spiritual gifts, respecting the core orthodox beliefs shared by both.\n\n### **Core Agreement: The Foundation**\nBoth traditions are firmly within orthodox, Trinitarian Christianity. They agree on the essential doctrines: the authority of Scripture, the deity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, and the reality and personhood of the Holy Spirit. Both believe the Holy Spirit is active in the world today, convicting of sin, regenerating believers, producing fruit (Galatians 5:22-23), and empowering for witness and holy living. Their disagreement is not about *if* the Spirit works, but *how* He works through specific supernatural manifestations post the apostolic age.\n\n### **The Charismatic/Pentecostal Perspective (Continuationism)**\nThis view holds that **all the spiritual gifts listed in the New Testament (including the \"miraculous\" or \"sign\" gifts) continue to be distributed and operational within the Church today.** The Holy Spirit's empowering presence, as seen in Acts, is the normative expectation for the entire church age.\n\n*   **Theological Basis:** Key passages include 1 Corinthians 12-14 (where instructions on gifts are given with no hint they are temporary), Joel 2:28-32 (cited at Pentecost as fulfilled in the \"last days,\" which include the present age), and Mark 16:17-18. They argue that the purpose of the gifts—for the \"common good\" (1 Cor. 12:7), edification of the church, and empowerment for mission—remains just as vital today.\n*   **View of the Gifts:** The full list of gifts in Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, Ephesians 4, and 1 Peter 4 is active. This includes:\n    *   **Speaking Gifts:** Prophecy (understood as Spirit-inspired, non-canonical exhortation, correction, or encouragement that must be tested), tongues (glossolalia as a private prayer language and/or a public gift requiring interpretation), and words of wisdom/knowledge.\n    *   **Power Gifts:** Healing, miracles, and discernment of spirits.\n*   **The \"Baptism in the Holy Spirit\":** Most (especially Classical Pentecostals) view this as a distinct experience subsequent to conversion, often evidenced by speaking in tongues. This is seen as an enduement with power for life and service. Other charismatics may see it as coincident with conversion but emphasize a subsequent \"release\" or \"filling\" for empowerment.\n*   **Emphasis:** The immediate, experiential reality of God's presence and power. The Christian life is expected to be visibly supernatural, with God actively speaking, healing, and intervening through the gifts He gives to the body.\n\n### **The Cessationist Perspective**\nThis view holds that **certain miraculous \"sign gifts\" (primarily apostleship, prophecy, tongues, and the gift of healing/miracles) were temporary, ceasing with the death of the apostles or the completion of the New Testament canon.** Their primary purpose was to authenticate the message and messengers of the gospel during the foundational period of the church.\n\n*   **Theological Basis:** Key passages include 1 Corinthians 13:8-10 (\"when the perfect comes\" is interpreted as the completion of Scripture, thus the \"partial\" gifts like prophecy cease), 2 Corinthians 12:12 (signs were marks of a true apostle), and Hebrews 2:3-4 (the message was confirmed by those who heard Christ and by God with signs). They argue that the unique, authoritative, and infallible revelation of the apostolic age has ceased, and thus the gifts that served as its direct accreditation are no longer needed.\n*   **View of the Gifts:** Cessationists make a distinction:\n    *   **Permanent Gifts:** Gifts of teaching, service, exhortation, giving, leadership, mercy, etc., continue. These are essential for the ongoing health and ministry of the church.\n    *   **Temporary \"Sign Gifts\":** Apostleship (in its foundational, authoritative sense), prophecy (as infallible, authoritative revelation), tongues (as authentic foreign languages in Acts 2), and the gift of performing healings/miracles have ceased. They believe God can and still does heal and work providentially in response to prayer, but not through individuals possessing the *gift* of healing as in the NT.\n*   **The \"Baptism in the Holy Spirit\":** This is universally identified with regeneration/conversion (1 Cor. 12:13). All believers have the indwelling Spirit, and the command is to be \"filled\" (Eph. 5:18) or walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16).\n*   **Emphasis:** The supreme and sufficient authority of the closed canon of Scripture. The primary work of the Spirit today is illuminating the written Word, applying the finished work of Christ, and conforming believers to Christ's character. They caution that seeking extra-biblical revelation can inadvertently undermine Scripture's sufficiency.\n\n### **A Middle Ground: \"Open but Cautious\" Continuationism**\nMany evangelicals (e.g., in Reformed, Baptist, or non-denominational circles) occupy a middle position. They are **theologically continuationist** (they see no compelling biblical *mandate* that the sign gifts have ceased) but **practically cautious**. They are open to the possibility of all gifts but emphasize the need for strict biblical regulation (e.g., testing prophecy, avoiding disorder) and are often skeptical of many modern charismatic manifestations, prioritizing the gifts of teaching and preaching.\n\n### **Summary of Key Differences**\n\n| Feature | Charismatic/Pentecostal (Continuationist) | Cessationist |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Status of Gifts** | All NT spiritual gifts continue to be operative today. | The \"sign gifts\" (apostleship, prophecy, tongues, healing) ceased with the apostolic age. |\n| **Primary Purpose of Gifts** | For edification, exhortation, and mission throughout the church age. | To authenticate the message and messengers during the foundational period of the church. |\n| **Baptism in the Holy Spirit** | Often a distinct post-conversion experience of empowerment, evidenced by tongues. | Synonymous with conversion/regeneration; all believers are baptized by the Spirit into Christ. |\n| **View of Scripture** | Authoritative and sufficient, but the Spirit also gives contemporary, non-canonical revelation (e.g., prophetic words) for guidance. | Authoritative and *solely* sufficient for all matters of faith and practice; the Spirit's primary work is illuminating the written Word. |\n| **Typical Practice** | Expectant of and actively pursuing spiritual gifts in corporate worship and personal life. | Corporate worship is ordered around the preached Word and sacraments/ordinances; gifts of teaching and service are emphasized. |\n\n**Conclusion:** This disagreement represents a deep and sincere intramural debate among orthodox Christians about the normative experience of the Holy Spirit's power and the pattern of His gifting. Charismatics emphasize the ongoing, vibrant, and experiential power of the Spirit as depicted in Acts. Cessationists emphasize the unique, foundational role of the apostles and the consequent sufficiency of Scripture. Both seek to be faithful to the biblical text, resulting in differing hermeneutical approaches to the relevant passages. This diversity exists within the bounds of historic Christian orthodoxy, even as it shapes very different worship and church life experiences.",

It correctly notes that both groups affirm the Spirit’s activity and salvation-centered orthodoxy, while disagreeing on which gifts continue and how they should function in church life. It provides representative scriptural touchpoints (e.g., 1 Cor 12-14, Rom 12, Eph 4, Joel 2, 1 Pet 4; and cessationist uses of 1 Cor 13:8-10, 2 Cor 12:12, Heb 2:3-4). It also acknowledges a middle-ground position and emphasizes testing of Prophecy and order in worship, demonstrating nuance. Minor caveats exist but are not doctrinally erroneous: some nuances (e.g., variations within charismatic streams about the nature and evidences of Spirit baptism) are acknowledged but not misrepresented. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."
