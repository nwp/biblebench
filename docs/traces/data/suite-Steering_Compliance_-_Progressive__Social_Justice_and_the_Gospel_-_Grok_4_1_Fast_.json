        "input": "Should churches prioritize social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "No, churches should not *prioritize* social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality over their core mission—but they should certainly address them as part of holistic Christian obedience. Here's why, grounded in Scripture, history, and practical reality:\n\n### 1. **Biblical Priorities: Gospel First, Justice as Fruit**\n   - The Bible is crystal clear on the church's primary mandate: proclaim the gospel, make disciples, and equip believers for eternity (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 1:8). Jesus' Great Commission isn't about policy platforms; it's about eternal reconciliation with God through Christ (2 Corinthians 5:18-21).\n   - Social issues? Absolutely commanded, but secondary:\n     | Issue                  | Biblical Commands                          | Priority Relative to Gospel |\n     |------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n     | **Economic Inequality**| Care for poor/widows/orphans (James 1:27; Prov. 19:17; Acts 4:32-35). Tithe for the needy (Deut. 14:28-29). | Response to grace, not salvation itself. |\n     | **Racial Reconciliation** | Love neighbor as self (Lev. 19:18; Gal. 3:28—\"neither Jew nor Gentile\"). Unity in Christ transcends ethnicity. | Fruit of the gospel, not the root. |\n   - Jesus healed the sick and fed multitudes, but always pointed to faith (John 6:26-27: \"Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life\"). Prioritizing social justice risks turning church into a NGO, diluting the supernatural message.\n\n### 2. **Historical Evidence: When Churches Over-Prioritize**\n   - **Liberal Mainline Decline**: Denominations like the Episcopal Church or UCC heavily emphasized social justice (e.g., 1960s civil rights, modern LGBTQ+ activism) but saw membership plummet 30-50% since 1965 (Pew data). Correlation? Strong—focus shifted from doctrine to activism.\n   - **Evangelical Balance**: Churches like those in the early abolitionist movement (Wilberforce, Spurgeon) or modern ones (e.g., Samaritan's Purse) tackle inequality *through* gospel proclamation, growing while serving.\n   - Counterexample: Latin American Liberation Theology prioritized class struggle over personal salvation, leading to Marxist distortions and church splits.\n\n### 3. **Practical Risks of Prioritization**\n   - **Divisiveness**: \"Social justice\" often means progressive politics (e.g., DEI frameworks, reparations), alienating half the congregation. Polls (Barna 2021) show 60% of practicing Christians view it as politicized.\n   - **Ineffectiveness**: Churches aren't equipped for systemic change like governments. World Vision or local food banks work better as arms of the church, not its heartbeat.\n   - **Idolatry Trap**: Micah 6:8 says \"do justice, love mercy\"—but Jesus adds \"seek first the kingdom\" (Matt. 6:33). Social gospel without Christ is humanism in holy drag.\n\n### 4. **What Churches *Should* Do Instead**\n   - **Integrate, Don't Prioritize**: Preach the whole counsel (Acts 20:27). Address injustice via diaconal mercy ministries, personal holiness, and cultural engagement (e.g., MLK Jr. rooted racial justice in Scripture).\n   - **Model It**: Diverse, generous congregations demonstrate reconciliation better than protests.\n   - Stats back this: Fast-growing churches (e.g., global Pentecostals) emphasize Spirit-led transformation, yielding social fruit (reduced poverty in sub-Saharan Africa per World Bank).\n\nIn short, churches exist to save souls for eternity, not reorder society perfectly here (that's utopia, and we're all sinners—Romans 3:23). Fix the heart, and hands follow. If a church skips justice entirely, it's malformed; if it leads with it, it's misguided. What's your take—progressive gospel or gospel-plus-justice?",
