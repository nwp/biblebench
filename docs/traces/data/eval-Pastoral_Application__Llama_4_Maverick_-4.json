    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "My heart goes out to you as you share your struggles with depression. It's utterly disheartening to face not only the weight of depression itself but also the added burden of judgment and misunderstanding from some within the Christian community. I want you to know that you are not alone, and I am here to offer you support and guidance grounded in Scripture.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that depression is a real and serious condition that affects many people, including Christians. It's not simply a matter of having \"enough faith\" or being spiritually strong. The Bible acknowledges that we live in a fallen world where suffering, including mental health struggles, is a reality (Romans 8:20-24). Our Lord Jesus Christ himself experienced deep emotional pain and sorrow (Matthew 26:37-38), showing us that emotional suffering is not outside the realm of God's understanding or care.\n\nThe idea that taking medication for depression is a sign of lacking faith or not trusting God is a harmful misconception. Seeking medical treatment is, in fact, a form of stewardship over the body God has given us (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). The Bible encourages us to care for our bodies and minds. Just as we might seek medical help for a physical ailment, seeking help for mental health is equally valid and can be a part of our overall care for our well-being as image-bearers of God.\n\nMoreover, faith is not about having all the answers or never facing challenges; it's about trusting in God's goodness and sovereignty even when we don't understand our circumstances (Proverbs 3:5-6). Your faith is not measured by your mental health status or your need for medication. Your faith is about your relationship with God, your trust in His character, and your commitment to following Him.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that spiritual struggles and mental health can be intertwined. Depression can affect our spiritual lives, making it harder to feel connected to God or to engage in spiritual practices. However, this does not mean that your depression is a reflection of your spiritual state. Many godly men and women in the Bible, such as Elijah (1 Kings 19:4) and Job (Job 3:1-26), experienced deep despair and emotional pain, yet their stories are also marked by profound faith and a deep relationship with God.\n\nIn terms of practical steps, I encourage you to continue seeking the help you need, whether that's through medication, therapy, or support groups. Surround yourself with people who understand and support you, and don't be afraid to reach out to church leaders or members who can provide a caring community.\n\nSpiritually, I want to encourage you to hold onto God's promises. Even in the midst of depression, God's love for you does not waver (Psalm 139:17-18). His Word is a source of comfort and strength. You may find it helpful to memorize and meditate on verses that speak of God's presence and care, such as Psalm 23 or Matthew 11:28-30.\n\nLastly, I want to assure you that you are not failing spiritually because you are struggling with depression or because you are on medication. Your worth and identity are rooted in Christ, not in your mental health status (2 Corinthians 5:17). You are loved, you are valued, and you are seen by God. Continue to seek Him, even when it's hard, and trust that He is with you in your journey.\n\nMay God's peace and comfort be with you as you navigate these challenges.",

          "rationale": "The response aligns well with orthodox Christian teaching on mental health, emphasizing that depression is a real medical issue and that seeking treatment (including medication) is a prudent stewardship of the body. It rejects the idea that faithfulness equals having no struggle or needing no medicine, and it grounds its claims in Scripture (Rom 8:20-24; Matt 26:37-38; 1 Cor 6:19-20; Prov 3:5-6; Psalm 23; Matt 11:28-30; Job/Elijah as examples) while affirming the central biblical truth that suffering does not define spiritual failure. It also underscores community support, prayer, and biblical counseling as appropriate complements to medical care, and notes that a believer’s identity is in Christ (2 Cor 5:17). The nuances are well-handled, particularly the idea that faith encompasses trust in God even amidst mystery and pain. A minor omission is a direct, explicit caution against repeating the old Job-like mistake of attributing suffering to personal sin (the response hints at this by affirming that faith isn’t measured by mental health status but could be strengthened by it), which would further align the answer with a fuller biblical nuance. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced."
