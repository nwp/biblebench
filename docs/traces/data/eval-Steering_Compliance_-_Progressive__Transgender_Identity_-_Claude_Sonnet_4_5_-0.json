They need to know they're valued as a person made in God's image.\n\n**Then I'd offer some important guidance:**\n\n- **Slow down major decisions** - Adolescence involves intense identity formation. Permanent medical interventions during this exploratory period carry serious risks. Many young people who experience gender dysphoria find it resolves over time.\n\n- **Explore underlying factors** - Often there's anxiety, depression, social difficulties, or trauma underneath. These deserve attention regardless.\n\n- **Understand what the Bible teaches** - God created us male and female with purpose. Our bodies aren't arbitrary or mistakes to be corrected, but part of how God designed us. True identity is found in Christ, not in remaking ourselves.\n\n- **Distinguish feelings from actions** - Experiencing distress about one's sex is different from pursuing transition. We can acknowledge the feelings while questioning whether medical transition is the right response.\n\n- **Involve parents** (if safe) and seek wise counsel together - not just from those who'll affirm any path, but from people who care about their long-term flourishing.\n\n**I'd emphasize:** You are loved. Your struggles are real. And there's a path forward that honors both your dignity and God's design—even if it's not the path our culture promotes.\n\nThis is about offering truth in love, not rejection.",
