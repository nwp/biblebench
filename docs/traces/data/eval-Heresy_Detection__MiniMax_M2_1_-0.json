    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.' Is this teaching orthodox or heretical? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "# Theological Analysis: The Statement on Christ's Nature\n\n## Verdict: Heretical\n\nThis teaching represents **Adoptionism** (also known as Dynamic Monarchianism), a Christological heresy that was condemned by the early Church. The statement contradicts fundamental orthodox doctrine regarding the person and nature of Jesus Christ.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Teaching Is Heretical\n\n### 1. It Denies the Eternal Divinity of Christ\n\nThe statement claims Jesus \"was not truly divine\" and was \"adopted as God's son at his baptism.\" This directly contradicts the orthodox understanding that Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, who \"was from the beginning\" (1 John 1:1-2), not a human who was elevated to divine status at a later point.\n\nThe Gospel of John opens with a clear declaration of Christ's pre-existence: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us\" (John 1:1, 14). This affirms that the one who became incarnate as Jesus existed eternally as God before taking on human form.\n\n### 2. It Contradicts Definitive Church Councils\n\nThe early ecumenical councils deliberately addressed and rejected this type of teaching:\n\n- **The Council of Nicaea (325 AD)** formulated the Nicene Creed specifically to combat Arianism—a related error that questioned Christ's full divinity. The Creed proclaims that Jesus is \"God from God, Light from Light, true God of true God,\" and was \"begotten, not made, of one substance with the Father.\"\n\n- **The Council of Chalcedon (451 AD)** further clarified that Christ exists \"in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.\"\n\nAdoptionism would have been explicitly rejected by these councils because it denies that Jesus was truly divine from all eternity and reduces Him to a mere human who was elevated.\n\n### 3. It Undermines Salvation and Mediation\n\nFrom an orthodox perspective, this heresy has profound implications for Christian faith and practice. If Jesus were merely a human who was adopted at His baptism, then:\n\n- He could not be the eternal God who created all things (John 1:3, Colossians 1:16-17)\n- He could not be the proper object of worship\n- His sacrifice would be that of a created being, not the infinite God taking on human flesh\n- He could not bridge the infinite gap between God and humanity\n\nThe orthodox position maintains that only a fully divine and fully human Savior could accomplish salvation. A merely human Jesus, adopted at baptism, would be insufficient for this purpose.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis teaching is heretical because it fundamentally undermines the doctrine of Christ's divinity, which has been defined as essential to orthodox Christianity since the earliest councils. While it affirms Jesus as a \"great prophet and teacher,\" it categorically denies the core Christian confession that Jesus is Lord and God (John 20:28-29), reducing Him to a lesser being than the eternal Son of God revealed in Scripture and confessed by the historic Church.",

            "Minor textual nuance: The response cites 1 John 1:1-2 to support the pre-existence of the Word, whereas the central biblical support for the Logos being God and becoming flesh is primarily John 1:1-3 and John 1:14. The broader point stands, but the scriptural grounding could be strengthened by relying more directly on John 1:1-3 rather than 1 John 1:1-2."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer accurately identifies Adoptionism (dynamic/monarchical form) as a heresy and explains why it contradicts orthodox Christology: Jesus as eternally the Son of God and one in substance with the Father, not a created being adopted at baptism. It correctly references key historical anchors (Nicene Creed, Chalcedon) and notes the implications for worship and salvation, which are central to orthodox Christology. The analysis also shows nuance by connecting Christology to soteriology and worship practices. A small enhancement would be to ground the pre-existence claim more solidly with John 1:1-3 (and perhaps Colossians 1:15-20) rather than relying on 1 John 1:1-2, which can be read in a way that doesn’t directly address pre-existence as clearly as the Johannine prologue. Overall, the response aligns well with biblical teaching and historic orthodoxy and captures the necessary distinctions."
