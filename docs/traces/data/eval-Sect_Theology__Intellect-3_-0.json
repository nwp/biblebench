    "input": "A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches: 'As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become.' Is this consistent with orthodox Christian theology? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "Based on orthodox Christian theology (as defined by historical creeds like the Nicene Creed and mainstream traditions: Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant), the Latter-day Saint (LDS) teaching **\"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become\" is fundamentally inconsistent.** It represents a significant departure in key areas of doctrine.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n1.  **The Nature of God:**\n    *   **Orthodox View:** God is **aseitic** (self-existent, having no beginning or end), **eternal**, **immutable** (unchanging in His nature, attributes, and purposes), **transcendent** (fundamentally distinct from and beyond His creation), and **simple** (without composition or parts). God is Spirit (John 4:24). He is the uncreated Creator, existing before all things and outside of time (though immanently involved within it). The Nicene Creed affirms Jesus Christ as \"very God of very God... begotten, not made, being of the same substance (homoousios) with the Father.\"\n    *   **LDS View (as per the statement):** Implies God was once a mortal man like humans are now. This suggests:\n        *   **A Beginning:** God had a starting point in time/space as a finite, mortal being.\n        *   **Change:** God underwent a process of progression or development from a lower state (man) to a higher state (God). This contradicts divine immutability.\n        *   **Anthropomorphism:** God's fundamental nature is modeled on a human, physical existence. While orthodox Christianity affirms God's personal nature, it does not limit God to a physical, embodied form in His essential being (though the Incarnation is a specific act of taking on flesh).\n        *   **Contingency:** God's existence and nature seem contingent upon prior causes or processes, rather than necessary and self-existent.\n    *   **Departure:** The LDS statement directly contradicts the core orthodox doctrines of God's eternity, self-existence, immutability, transcendence, and spiritual nature. It presents God as a created being who evolved, not as the uncreated Creator.\n\n2.  **The Nature of Humanity and Salvation:**\n    *   **Orthodox View:** Humans are created beings (not eternally existent), distinct from God in nature (though made in His image - imago Dei). Salvation (theosis or deification) involves **grace** – the unmerited favor and transformative power of God – restoring humanity to a right relationship with God, granting eternal life and participation in the divine life (e.g., 2 Peter 1:4). However, this **does not** mean humans become ontologically God or equal to God. Humans remain creatures; God remains Creator. The distinction between Creator and creature is absolute and eternal. Humans are called to be \"partakers of the divine nature,\" not \"become God.\"\n    *   **LDS View (as per the statement):** Explicitly states that man \"may become\" what God now is – implying ontological equality. Humans have the *potential* to progress eternally to become gods themselves, possessing the same type of exalted, physical, embodied state as the Father (and presumably the Son/Holy Ghost).\n    *   **Departure:** The LDS view of salvation as ontological progression to godhood directly contradicts the orthodox view of salvation as relational restoration and participation through grace, while maintaining an absolute ontological distinction between God and creation. It redefines salvation as achieving divine status and nature, not communion with God.\n\n3.  **Creation:**\n    *   **Orthodox View:** Creation *ex nihilo* (out of nothing) by the sovereign will of the eternal God. Matter is created by God and fundamentally distinct from Him. God is not part of the created order; He is its source and sustainer.\n    *   **LDS View:** Often involves the idea that God organized pre-existing matter (or intelligences) into worlds. While the statement doesn't explicitly state this, the concept of God progressing from man implies a universe where matter and intelligence may be co-eternal with God or inherent within the progression. Humans are seen as co-eternal intelligences (or \"spirit children\") progressing.\n    *   **Departure:** The LDS view, suggested by the progression doctrine, leans towards co-eternity of matter/intelligence with God or inherent potential within creation, contrasting with the orthodox view of a sovereign Creator bringing everything into existence from nothing.\n\n**Areas of Potential (but Limited) Agreement or Similarity:**\n\n*   **Progression/Development:** While the *nature* of the progression is radically different, both recognize some form of development or purposeful movement. Orthodoxy sees spiritual growth in the Christian life (sanctification) and the ultimate renewal of creation (resurrection, new heavens/earth). The LDS sees progression towards godhood in this life and eternally. The *goal* and the *means* (grace vs. effort/obedience) are fundamentally different.\n*   **Human Potential:** Both affirm humans have a high potential and purpose. Orthodoxy sees this fulfilled in eternal communion with God as His beloved children. LDS sees it fulfilled in becoming gods. The *scope* and *ontological nature* of this fulfillment differ profoundly.\n*   **God's Involvement:** Both affirm God's active involvement in the world and human destiny.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe LDS statement **\"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become\" is deeply inconsistent with orthodox Christian theology.** It departs significantly in its understanding of:\n\n1.  **God's Nature:** Denying His eternity, self-existence, immutability, and transcendence, presenting Him instead as a created, progressing being.\n2.  **Human Nature and Destiny:** Redefining salvation as ontological progression to godhood, contradicting the orthodox view of salvation by grace through faith leading to relational union with God while maintaining creaturehood.\n3.  **Creation:** Implying a co-eternal element (intelligence/matter) or a process inherent within creation, contrasting with creation *ex nihilo*.\n\nThis teaching places the LDS view firmly outside the boundaries of orthodox, historic Christianity, as defined by the foundational creeds and doctrines universally accepted by Catholic, Orthodox, and major Protestant traditions. The differences are not merely matters of emphasis but represent fundamentally incompatible understandings of the core realities of God, humanity, and salvation.",

            "Minor factual caveat: the LDS cosmology regarding 'matter' and 'intelligences' is nuanced and debated within Mormon thought.

          ],
          "rationale": "The answer accurately reflects orthodox Christian teaching about the nature of God (eternal, immutable, transcendent, Creator), the orthodox understanding of theosis (participation in the divine nature without ontological equality with God), and the biblical basis (Malachi 3:6; Isaiah 43:10; 44:6; John 4:24; 2 Peter 1:4) and creedal language (Nicene Creed). It correctly identifies the LDS claim about potential divine status as incompatible with orthodox theology and highlights key doctrinal differences in God, humanity, and creation. The treatment of areas of overlap (God’s active involvement and human potential in sanctification) is appropriately nuanced. The main caveat is a need for cautious phrasing on LDS cosmology specifics (matter/intelligence eternity) and a minor spelling/terminology correction."
