    "expected": "The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became human, lived a perfect life, died on the cross as a substitute for sinners, rose from the dead, and now offers salvation and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe in him. It proclaims that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, not earned by human effort, received through faith in Christ alone.",
    "output": "To define the gospel from the perspective of systematic theology, one must recognize that the word itself—*euangelion* in Greek—means \"good news.\" In the Christian tradition, the gospel is not merely a moral code or a self-help philosophy; it is a historical announcement of what God has accomplished through Jesus Christ to restore a fallen creation to Himself.\n\nTo understand the gospel systematically, we can break it down into four essential movements: **God, Man, Christ, and Response.**\n\n### 1. The Character of God (The Standard)\nThe gospel begins with the nature of God as the holy, righteous, and sovereign Creator of all things (Genesis 1:1; Revelation 4:11). Because God is holy, He is the source of all moral value and the rightful judge of the universe. He is also love, desiring fellowship with His creation. However, His justice requires that He cannot simply ignore evil or rebellion (Exodus 34:6–7).\n\n### 2. The Fall of Man (The Problem)\nHumanity, created in the image of God to reflect His glory, fell into sin through disobedience. Systematic theology defines sin not just as \"making mistakes,\" but as *transgression* (breaking God's law) and *iniquity* (a corrupted state of being).\n*   **Total Depravity:** Because of the Fall, every part of human nature—mind, will, and emotions—is corrupted by sin (Romans 3:10–12, 23).\n*   **Separation:** The consequence of sin is spiritual and physical death, resulting in eternal separation from God’s presence (Romans 6:23). Man is legally guilty before the divine court and powerless to save himself through good works (Ephesians 2:8–9).\n\n### 3. The Work of Christ (The Solution)\nThe \"Good News\" is that God intervened in history through the Person and Work of Jesus Christ. This is the heart of the gospel, often categorized by two doctrines:\n\n*   **The Person of Christ (Incarnation):** Jesus is truly God and truly man. He lived the life of perfect obedience that we failed to live (Hebrews 4:15).\n*   **The Work of Christ (Atonement):** On the cross, a \"Divine Exchange\" took place. Through **Penal Substitutionary Atonement**, Jesus took the guilt and punishment of our sin upon Himself, satisfying the justice of God. Simultaneously, His perfect righteousness is credited (imputed) to those who believe (2 Corinthians 5:21).\n*   **The Resurrection:** His bodily resurrection from the dead is the vindication of His victory over sin and death, proving that the sacrifice was accepted and that He is the Lord of life (1 Corinthians 15:3–4).\n\n### 4. The Response (The Application)\nThe gospel is not a universal grant that applies to everyone regardless of their posture; it demands a response. This response is composed of two inseparable elements: **Repentance and Faith.**\n\n*   **Repentance:** A \"change of mind\" that leads to turning away from sin and self-governance.\n*   **Faith:** Placing one's total trust in the person and finished work of Jesus Christ alone for salvation. It is not mere intellectual assent, but a wholehearted reliance (John 3:16; Acts 20:21).\n\n### The Goal: Reconciliation and New Creation\nThe ultimate end of the gospel is the glory of God through the reconciliation of all things.\n*   **Justification:** The believer is declared righteous before God.\n*   **Sanctification:** The believer is being transformed into the image of Christ by the Holy Spirit.\n*   **Glorification:** The future hope of a restored world where God dwells with His people in a new heaven and a new earth (Revelation 21:1–5).\n\n### Summary\nIn the words of the apostle Paul in **1 Corinthians 15:1–4**, the gospel is the announcement: *“that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures.”*\n\n**The Gospel is the announcement that the righteous Judge has become the gracious Savior.**",

          "rationale": "The LLM answer presents a solid, evangelical understanding of the gospel. It correctly defines euangelion, outlines the fourfold movement (God, Man, Christ, Response), and gives biblically grounded specifics: God's holiness and justice; human sin and total depravity; Christ's incarnation, penal substitutionary atonement, and resurrection; and the proper response of repentance and faith. It appropriately emphasizes that salvation is by grace and received through faith, not earned by works, and it cites key scriptures (Rom 3:10-12; Rom 6:23; Eph 2:8-9; 2 Cor 5:21; 1 Cor 15:3-4; John 3:16; Acts 20:21; etc.). The summary statement aligns with classic gospel summaries (1 Cor 15:1-4) and the goal of justification, sanctification, and glorification, with a cosmic note about new creation. The treatment includes important theological distinctions (e.g., justification, imputed righteousness, substitutionary atonement) and recognizes the necessity of a response (repentance and faith). Nuance is present in explaining that the gospel entails a universal invitation with a personal, constrained response, and it avoids reducing the gospel to mere morality. Potential caveats (not defects) include: PSA is presented as the primary atonement theory (some traditions emphasize other atonement models as complementary or alternative), and regeneration by the Holy Spirit is not explicitly named though implied in repentance/faith. The phrase “reconciliation of all things” is biblical but can be misread as universal salvation without careful qualification; the answer does note the standard eschatological framework (justification, sanctification, glorification) to orient this rightly. Overall, the response is doctrinally orthodox, biblically grounded, and nuanced."

          "explanation": "Overall assessment: orthodox. The response preserves the historic gospel core: God’s holiness and justice; human sin and total depravity; the incarnation and full humanity of Christ; penal substitutionary atonement (PSA) with imputed righteousness; the resurrection; and a genuine call to repentance and faith as the proper response, yielding justification, sanctification, and glorification, with the eschatological aim of new creation. It explicitly rejects common heresies such as Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, and Docetism. The emphasis on the “Divine Exchange” and PSA aligns with classic Protestant orthodoxy rather than heterodox teaching. Potential clarifications could include: (1) the phrase “reconciliation of all things” should be read as cosmic restoration rather than universal salvation of every individual; (2) ensure explicit Trinitarian language to avoid any misreading as modalism; and (3) maintain the universality of the gospel offer with salvation conditioned on faith and repentance. Overall, no severe heresy is detected."
