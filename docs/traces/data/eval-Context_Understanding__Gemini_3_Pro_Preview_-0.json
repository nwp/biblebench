    "input": "Who wrote the Gospel of John and what was his relationship to Jesus?",
    "expected": "John the Apostle, one of Jesus' twelve disciples, known as 'the disciple whom Jesus loved'",
    "output": "Based on internal biblical evidence, early church tradition, and modern biblical scholarship, the answer to the authorship of the Gospel of John involves distinguishing between the traditional view and contemporary critical perspectives.\n\n### The Traditional View: John the Apostle\nThe traditional view, held by the church since the second century, is that the Gospel was written by **John, the son of Zebedee**.\n\n**His Relationship to Jesus:**\nIf John the Apostle is the author, his relationship to Jesus was arguably the closest of all the disciples.\n*   **One of the Twelve:** He was one of the original twelve apostles called by Jesus.\n*   **The \"Inner Circle\":** Along with Peter and his brother James, John was part of an exclusive trio present for pivotal moments where the other disciples were excluded, such as the Transfiguration (Mark 9:2) and the Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (Mark 14:33).\n*   **The Beloved Disciple:** Tradition identifies John as \"the disciple whom Jesus loved.\" This figure is depicted reclining against Jesus at the Last Supper (John 13:23), standing at the foot of the cross (John 19:26), and being entrusted with the care of Mary, the mother of Jesus.\n\n**Historical Support:**\nThe primary basis for this view is the testimony of the early Church Fathers. Irenaeus (c. 180 AD) wrote that John, the disciple of the Lord, published the Gospel while living in Ephesus. Irenaeus claimed to have received this information from Polycarp, a bishop who reportedly knew the apostles personally.\n\n---\n\n### The Internal Evidence: The \"Beloved Disciple\"\nThe text of the Gospel does not explicitly name its author. Instead, it claims to rely on the testimony of a specific, unnamed individual known as **\"the disciple whom Jesus loved\"** (or the Beloved Disciple).\n\nThe Gospel concludes with this assertion:\n> *\"This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true.\"* (John 21:24)\n\nThis implies that the Beloved Disciple is the primary eyewitness source of the traditions contained in the book.\n\n---\n\n### The Scholarly/Critical View: The Johannine Community\nWhile many conservative scholars maintain that John the Apostle wrote the text, a significant number of modern historians and biblical scholars propose a more complex composition history, often referred to as the **Johannine Community hypothesis**.\n\n**Key distinctions in this view include:**\n1.  **Anonymity:** Scholars note that the Gospel never identifies the \"Beloved Disciple\" as the son of Zebedee. Some theories posit that this disciple could be a different follower of Jesus, such as Lazarus, Thomas, or a lesser-known disciple based in Jerusalem.\n2.  **John the Presbyter (The Elder):** Some scholars, referencing the writings of Papias (early 2nd century), suggest the author may have been a distinct figure known as \"John the Elder,\" a leader in the church at Ephesus, distinct from John the Apostle.\n3.  **Stages of Composition:** The majority of critical scholars believe the Gospel was not written in a single sitting by one person. Instead, it likely evolved through several stages:\n    *   **Stage 1:** The oral preaching and eyewitness accounts of the \"Beloved Disciple.\"\n    *   **Stage 2:** The formation of a distinct community (the Johannine Community) that preserved these teachings.\n    *   **Stage 3:** A final redactor (editor) who organized the material and added the final chapter (John 21) after the death of the Beloved Disciple.\n\n### Summary\n*   **Who wrote it?** Tradition identifies the author as **John the Apostle**. Modern scholarship suggests it was written by followers within the **Johannine Community** who recorded and edited the testimony of a founding teacher (the Beloved Disciple), whom they linked to the Apostle John.\n*   **Relationship to Jesus:** The source of the Gospel was an **eyewitness** and an intimate companion of Jesus, described as the disciple \"whom Jesus loved,\" who reclined next to him at the Last Supper and witnessed the crucifixion firsthand.",

          "rationale": "The answer correctly presents the traditional claim (John the Apostle) and major critical perspectives (Johannine Community, anonymity, John the Elder) and cites key textual anchors (Mark 9:2; Mark 14:33; John 13:23; John 19:26; John 21:24). It covers the Beloved Disciple as a central figure and notes that the Gospel itself does not name its author. Nuance is appropriately conveyed by distinguishing tradition from scholarly consensus and by outlining different theories about authorship and composition. The main areas for caution are minor overstatements about a single 'primary eyewitness' source and the timing/extent of editorial additions, which are debated in scholarship. Overall, it answers the question directly and with appropriate scholarly context."
