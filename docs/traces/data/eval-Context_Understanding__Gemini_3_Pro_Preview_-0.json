          "rationale": "The response accurately highlights the key scriptural point that there is a 'beloved disciple' in John, and aligns with historic Christian teaching about John. However, it presents as fact the authorship and familial identity (John the Apostle, the son of Zebedee) which are traditional attributions not explicit in Scripture. It also uses the concept of an 'inner circle' which, while common in Christian tradition, is not explicitly delineated in the Gospel text. Overall, the core doctrinal content is sound, but the biblical grounding for authorship and familial details is not explicit in Scripture, and the answer would benefit from noting the traditional nature of those attributions."
