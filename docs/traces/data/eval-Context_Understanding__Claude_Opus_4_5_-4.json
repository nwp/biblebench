          "rationale": "The answer correctly identifies the Sermon on the Mount as primarily addressed to Jesus’ disciples, while acknowledging that the crowds were present and listening. This matches Matthew 5:1-2, which notes that the disciples came to him and he began to teach them, and Matthew 7:28, which notes that the crowds were astonished by his teaching. The phrasing “primary audience … with the broader crowds listening nearby” accurately reflects the biblical text and the common theological understanding that the discourse is directed to the disciples but heard by the crowd. The response is biblically grounded and broadly in line with historic Christian interpretation; it also captures the important nuance that both groups are involved. Minor improvements could simply reiterate that some portions are more directly addressed to the disciples while the crowd also hears, which the answer already implies. No doctrinal or biblical errors detected."
