And He opened His mouth and taught them.\" This suggests the disciples were the primary, immediate recipients of this teaching.\n\n2. **The crowds** - Matthew 7:28-29 notes that \"when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at His teaching.\" This indicates the multitudes were also present and listening.\n\n### Broader Intended Audience\n\n**Jewish listeners** were the contextual audience. The sermon is deeply rooted in Jewish law, prophetic tradition, and rabbinic teaching methods. Jesus's repeated phrase \"You have heard it was said... but I say to you\" engages directly with Torah interpretation.\n\n### Scholarly Perspectives\n\nMost scholars agree that Matthew's Gospel was written primarily for a **Jewish-Christian community**, which shapes how the Sermon is presented. The emphasis on fulfilling (not abolishing) the Law (5:17-20) and references to synagogues, Pharisees, and Jewish practices support this.\n\nHowever, the ethical teachings have universal dimensions, suggesting Matthew also intended the sermon to guide all followers of Jesus, both Jewish and Gentile believers.",

          "rationale": "The answer accurately identifies the Sermon on the Mount as having a two-tier audience in Matthew 5–7: the disciples as the primary, immediate recipients and the broader crowds/listeners as a secondary audience. It correctly cites the opening scene (Matthew 5:1–2) and the closing note about the crowds’ astonishment (Matthew 7:28–29). It adds a plausible broader context by highlighting the Jewish context of the sermon (influence of Torah, prophetic tradition, and rabbinic modes of teaching) and notes the common scholarly view that Matthew is aimed at a Jewish-Christian audience, while acknowledging that the ethical teachings have universal dimensions for all followers. This covers the essential facts and presents appropriate scholarly nuance without overclaiming certainty. The response aligns with standard historical/contextual understanding and directly answers the question asked. "
