            "The claim that 'most scholars agree Matthew wrote for a Jewish-Christian community in Syria (Antioch)' is overstated or not universally agreed; scholars vary on the dating and exact location of Matthew’s composition. It would be better to hedge this with phrases like 'many scholars date Matthew to a Jewish-Christian audience, with proposed settings including Antioch or other Diaspora communities, dating roughly 70–90 CE.'"

          "rationale": "The answer accurately identifies the Sermon on the Mount's two-tier audience (disciples and crowds) and emphasizes the Jewish context (Law/Prophets, 'You have heard it said…', practices like almsgiving, prayer, fasting). It also correctly notes that Matthew is commonly viewed as addressing a Jewish-Christian audience and provides a plausible dating window. However, it overstates consensus about the precise locale (Syria/Antioch) and the scope of authorship consensus, which is contested; hedging these points would improve precision. Overall, it directly answers the question and presents appropriate nuance."
