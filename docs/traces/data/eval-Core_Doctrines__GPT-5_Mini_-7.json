    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "Definition and core claim\n- The doctrine of the resurrection of the body teaches that at the last day God will raise the dead so that every human person will be bodily reunited and transformed. Resurrection is not merely the survival of an immaterial soul, nor a resuscitation of the old corpse, but the creation of a renewed, imperishable bodily life in continuity with the person’s pre‑mortem identity and in discontinuity with the corruptible and mortal condition of death.\n\nBiblical foundation\n- Old Testament anticipations: Daniel 12:2 speaks of the sleeping dead awakening to everlasting life or shame; Job 19:25–27 expresses hope to see God after death; Psalm 16:10 (and the use of this psalm in Acts) looks forward to vindication beyond the grave.\n- Central in the New Testament:\n  - Jesus’ resurrection is the model and guarantee: the risen Christ is bodily (not merely a spirit), appears with wounds and eats with his disciples (Luke 24; John 20–21). Paul presents Christ as “the firstfruits” of the coming general resurrection (1 Cor 15:20–23).\n  - Explicit teaching about the future bodily resurrection: John 5:28–29 (all who are in the graves shall hear his voice), Acts 24:15, and Revelation 20:4–6.\n  - Paul’s systematic teaching in 1 Corinthians 15: the gospel depends on Christ’s resurrection (vv. 12–19); the dead will be raised “imperishable” (v. 42) and “in a spiritual body” (v. 44); what is sown perishable is raised imperishable (vv. 35–58).\n  - Romans 8:11 links the Spirit who raised Christ to the future life of believers’ bodies; Philippians 3:20–21 speaks of Christ transforming our lowly bodies to be like his glorious body.\n\nNature of the resurrection body (continuity and discontinuity)\n- Continuity: Personal identity is preserved. The resurrection body is the same person’s body in some real sense (Paul insists on continuity: “that which you sow is not made alive unless it dies” and “we shall all be changed” — 1 Cor 15:36–52).\n- Discontinuity/transformation: The resurrection body differs qualitatively from our present corruptible bodies. Paul contrasts “perishable” vs “imperishable,” “dishonorable” vs “glorious,” “weak” vs “powerful,” “natural body” vs “spiritual body” (1 Cor 15:42–44). It will not be subject to decay, weakness, sickness, or death and will be fitted for the redeemed life of the new creation.\n- Not merely “spirit”: When Scripture calls the resurrection body “spiritual” (pneumatikon), Paul means it is oriented and empowered by the Spirit, not that it is non‑bodily. The New Testament repeatedly affirms a bodily, not disembodied, future.\n\nTiming and order\n- The New Testament teaches a twofold sense of resurrection:\n  - Christ’s resurrection is already—his resurrection inaugurates the new age and is the down payment of believers’ resurrection (1 Cor 15:20–23; Rom 8:11).\n  - The general or final resurrection occurs when Christ returns, at which the dead in Christ will be raised and all will be judged (1 Thess 4:13–18; John 5:28–29; Rev 20). Some texts (e.g., Revelation 20:4–6) speak of a “first resurrection” of the righteous and a later resurrection and judgment of the wicked; how to order all eschatological details has been discussed in diverse traditions.\n\nRelation to the intermediate state\n- The Bible also pictures an intermediate state in which the believer’s soul is with Christ (Phil 1:23; Luke 23:43) or asleep until the resurrection (1 Thess 4:13–14 language). Most historic Christian traditions hold that the soul consciously enjoys fellowship with Christ after death and that full human life is consummated only at the bodily resurrection.\n\nTheological significance\n- Vindication and justice: Resurrection is God’s vindication of the righteous and the final judgment of the wicked (Acts 17:31; John 5:29).\n- Redemption of the whole person and creation: Resurrection shows that salvation is not disembodied spiritual escape but the redemption of body and soul and the renewal of creation (Romans 8:19–23; Revelation 21–22).\n- Assurance and hope: The bodily resurrection of Christ guarantees believers’ future resurrection (1 Cor 15:20–23) and provides comfort in death (1 Thess 4:13–18).\n- Ethical motivation: Because bodies matter and will be redeemed, Christian morality cares for embodied life and justice in this world.\n\nHistorical and confessional note\n- The early church and the creeds confess “the resurrection of the body” (Apostles’ Creed, Nicene Creed). This rejects both Greek‑style dualism that denigrates the body and any view that reduces resurrection to mere immortality of the soul or to reincarnation.\n\nCommon objections and brief responses\n- Objection: How can identity persist if the body is radically transformed? Response: Scripture teaches both continuity and transformation. Personal identity is maintained (appearing to the same disciples, bearing wounds) even as the body is glorified and no longer corruptible (1 Cor 15; Luke 24).\n- Objection: Is the resurrection simply symbolic? Response: The New Testament treats resurrection as a real future event rooted in the historical resurrection of Jesus; Paul bases Christian hope on bodily resurrection (1 Cor 15).\n\nPastoral implications\n- The doctrine brings concrete hope in the face of death, shapes mourning (not despair), grounds bodily care and social justice, and orients Christian worship and mission toward the renewal of all things.\n\nSummary\n- The resurrection of the body proclaims that God will raise the dead, reuniting and transforming body and soul. Grounded in Christ’s own bodily resurrection and taught throughout Scripture, it affirms both the continuity of personal identity and the discontinuity of a glorified, imperishable life—and it lies at the heart of Christian hope for the redemption of persons and creation.",

          "rationale": "The response presents a thorough and largely orthodox treatment of the resurrection of the body. It correctly emphasizes: the future, bodily nature of the resurrection; continuity of personal identity with a transformed, imperishable body; and the central role of Christ’s resurrection as the guarantee and pattern (firstfruits). It aligns with key New Testament texts (1 Cor 15; Rom 8:11; Phil 3:20–21; John 5:28–29; 1 Thess 4:13–18; Acts 24:15; Rev 20:4–6) and meaningful Old Testament anticipation (Dan 12:2; Job 19:25–27; Ps 16:10 in its NT apostolic use). The discussion of “spiritual body” in 1 Cor 15:44 is handled with a standard nuance: the body is truly bodily and empowered by the Spirit, not non-physical. It acknowledges the tension between continuity and transformation (Paul’s language of perishable/imperishable, natural/spiritual) and preserves both the salvific scope (body, soul, creation) and the ethical implications (care for embodied life). It also notes the intermediate state and the eschatological sequence (inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection, culminated at his return, with a place for a “first resurrection” motif in Revelation 20). Pastoral and confessional notes are included, reflecting historic creedal language. The response is well-grounded in Scripture and consistent with historic orthodoxy. Minor caveats exist in how some texts are interpreted (e.g., the exact nuances of “spiritual body” and the precise ordering of bodily resurrection in Revelation 20), but these do not undermine the overall accuracy or doctrine presented."

          "explanation": "The response presents a broadly orthodox, biblically grounded account of the resurrection of the body, aligning with historic creeds and major biblical passages. It emphasizes continuity of personal identity, yet transformation to an imperishable, glorified body; rejects Gnostic/Docetic denials of material flesh; asserts the bodily resurrection in both the present age (Christ's resurrection) and the future (final resurrection). It also notes the intermediate state and two-stage eschatology without asserting a non-orthodox position. While some interpretive nuances differ among traditions (e.g., exact nature of 'spiritual body' or the order of resurrections), these are not heretical errors. No denial of the Trinity or Christ's divinity is evident; overall, no heresy is detected."
