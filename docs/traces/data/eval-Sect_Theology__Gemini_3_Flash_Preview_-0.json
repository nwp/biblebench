    "input": "A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches: 'As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become.' Is this consistent with orthodox Christian theology? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "The couplet you quoted was formulated by Lorenzo Snow, the fifth President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), in 1840. It summarizes a core tenet of their theology known as **exaltation** or **eternal progression**.\n\nTo analyze this from the perspective of orthodox Christian theology (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant), it is necessary to examine both halves of the statement, as they challenge foundational Christian dogmas regarding the nature of God and the nature of humanity.\n\n### 1. \"As man now is, God once was\" (The Nature of God)\n\n**Orthodox Christian Position: Substantial Departure**\nOrthodox Christianity is rooted in **Ontological Monotheism**—the belief that God is a fundamentally different kind of being than His creation.\n\n*   **Aseity and Immutability:** Orthodox theology teaches that God is *self-existent* (uncreated) and *immutable* (unchanging). According to the Nicene Creed and the writings of the Church Fathers, God has always been God. He did not \"evolve\" or \"progress\" into divinity. \n*   **The Creator/Creature Distinction:** In mainstream Christianity, God is *ipsum esse subsistens* (subsistent act of existing). He is the infinite source of all that is. The idea that God was once a mortal man who lived under the laws of a prior God contradicts the doctrine of God as the \"Alpha and Omega,\" the First Cause who has no beginning.\n\n**LDS Perspective:** This teaching suggests that God the Father has a body of flesh and bone and attained His status through a process of progression. This reflects a \"social trinitarianism\" or \"moral monotheism\" where God is worshipped as the Supreme Being of this universe, but is part of a lineage of divine beings.\n\n### 2. \"As God now is, man may become\" (The Destiny of Man)\n\n**Orthodox Christian Position: Superficial Agreement, Fundamental Difference**\nThis half of the couplet is more complex because it shares terminology with the ancient Christian doctrine of ***Theosis*** (Deification or Divinization). However, the underlying definitions differ significantly.\n\n*   **Areas of Agreement (Theosis):** Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, and some Anglican/Wesleyan traditions teach that humans are called to \"become partakers of the divine nature\" (2 Peter 1:4). A famous aphorism by St. Athanasius (4th Century) sounds strikingly similar: *\"God became man so that man might become god.\"* Both traditions agree that salvation involves more than just a legal pardon; it involves a profound transformation into the likeness of Christ.\n*   **Areas of Departure (The Nature of Becoming):**\n    *   **Grace vs. Essence:** In orthodox *Theosis*, humans become \"gods\" by *grace*, not by nature. A human remains a creature and never becomes an independent \"god\" with their own autonomy or universe. The distinction between Creator and creature is never abolished.\n    *   **The LDS View (Exaltation):** In LDS theology, \"man may become\" refers to becoming an actual God, equal in kind to God the Father, possessing the power to create worlds and have eternal increase (children). In this view, humans are of the same \"species\" as God, currently in an embryonic state.\n\n### Summary of Relational Analysis\n\n| Concept | Orthodox Christian Theology | LDS Theology |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Origin of God** | God is eternal, uncreated, and has always been God. | God the Father progressed from mortality to divinity. |\n| **Nature of God** | Spirit, infinite, and transcendent. | Corporeal (has a body), once human. |\n| **Human Destiny** | Union with God (*Theosis*); humans remain creatures. | Exaltation; humans can become gods of the same kind. |\n| **Creator/Creature Gap** | An infinite, ontological bridge that cannot be crossed. | A temporary gap of progression; we are the same species. |\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile Lorenzo Snow’s couplet uses language that echoes certain mystical traditions of the early Church (specifically the idea of becoming \"divine\"), it is **not consistent with orthodox Christian theology.**\n\nThe primary point of departure is the **denial of the ontological uniqueness of God.** To orthodox Christianity, the idea that God \"was once a man\" is considered a rejection of His status as the eternal, sovereign Creator. Conversely, the idea that man can become a \"God\" in his own right is viewed as a blurring of the line between the Infinite and the finite.\n\nIn summary, while both traditions emphasize a high calling for humanity and a close relationship with the Divine, they operate on different metaphysical foundations regarding who God is and what it means to be human.",

            "The response labels LDS theology with terms like 'social Trinitarianism' and 'moral monotheism,' which are debated and can oversimplify a complex position. Some scholars and Latter-day Saints themselves would resist or nuance these labels; the LDS view on the nature of God is not universally summarized as a simple, widely agreed-upon 'social Trinitarian' model.",
            "There is a nuance about God the Father’s ontological status in LDS teaching that is delicate. The line that God the Father 'progressed from mortality to divinity' reflects a traditional formulation (as quoted in the Snow couplet) but is itself a contested historiographical and theological point within LDS thought. Presenting it as an uncontested summary risks overstating how uniformly that claim is held across LDS belief and discourse.",
            "The discussion of theosis could have more clearly distinguished the Orthodox insistence that divinization is by grace and participation in the divine nature, not by becoming ontologically identical to God the Father. The LLM states this, but some readers might misinterpret it as suggesting a closer equivalence between Creator and creature than orthodox teaching allows."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the LLM’s answer aligns closely with orthodox Christian teaching: God is eternal, unchanging, and ontologically distinct from creation; humanity is transformed into the likeness of Christ through grace (theosis) but does not become God in essence. It accurately notes the LDS emphasis on exaltation and the possibility of humans becoming gods in the LDS framework, and it contrasts that with orthodox teaching. Nuanced distinctions are well-handled, including the grace-based nature of theosis and the Creator/creature distinction. Minor cautions arise from potentially oversimplified characterizations of LDS epistemology (e.g., 'social Trinitarianism') and from the complexity of how literally to apply the Snow couplet to LDS doctrine. These caveats prevent a perfect portrayal, though they do not substantially undermine the overall accuracy of the analysis."
