They may be saved by Christ’s work without having explicit knowledge of Him. This approach is associated with some Catholic and Protestant theologians (e.g., the idea of “anonymous Christians” in certain interpretations).\n- Pluralism or Universalism (less common in strict forms): The idea that multiple religions can lead to God or that everyone will eventually be saved.
