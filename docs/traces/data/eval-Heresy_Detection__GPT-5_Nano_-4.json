    "expected": "This resembles Marcionism, a second-century heresy that rejected the Old Testament and taught there were two different gods. This is false. Orthodox Christianity affirms the unity of God across both Testaments. The same God who created the world, gave the law, and showed justice in the Old Testament is the God who sent Jesus. Jesus himself affirmed the Old Testament (Matthew 5:17-18) and revealed God's character as both just and merciful throughout scripture.",
    "output": "Verdict: Not orthodox. This is the classic Marcionite/“two gods” position. It denies the unity of God and treats the Old and New Testaments as if they reveal different, incompatible beings.\n\nWhy this view is wrong\n\n- It breaks the unity of God. Scripture repeatedly affirms that there is one God who acts in history as the one God of both Testaments (Deuteronomy 6:4; James 2:19; 1 Timothy 2:5). The God of Israel in the OT is the same God revealed in the person and work of Jesus in the NT.\n\n- It misreads the Old Testament’s character. The OT often speaks of God’s wrath against sin, but it also proclaims mercy, faithfulness, and steadfast love (Exodus 34:6–7; Psalm 103; Isaiah 54:10). Wrath is a righteous response to evil, not evidence that the OT God is “evil” or different from the NT God.\n\n- It contradicts Jesus’ own teaching and the apostolic witness. Jesus repeatedly affirms and fulfills the OT (Matthew 5:17–18; Luke 24:27, 44–46). The apostles treat the OT as Scripture about the same God who sent Jesus (2 Timothy 3:16–17; Hebrews 1:1–2). The claim that Jesus reveals a different, true God is not supported by the New Testament’s own testimony about Jesus.\n\n- It misreads the gospel, especially the cross. The NT portrays the cross as the supreme revelation of God’s love and justice together (John 3:16; Romans 3:25–26; Colossians 1:19–20). Far from showing a different God, the cross reveals the fullness of the one God’s character—holiness, mercy, justice, and love.\n\n- It tends toward a dualism that the early church rejected. The idea that there are two gods or two mutually exclusive revelations is essentially Marcionism. The early church condemned that view because it undermines creation, revelation, and salvation history.\n\n- It has practical and ecclesial problems. It obscures Israel’s and the OT’s ongoing relevance for Christians, risks anti-Judaism or anti-Semitism, and reduces the integrity of Scripture’s divine authorship and intent.\n\nHow to respond constructively\n\n- Emphasize the unity and continuity of revelation: God spoke through the prophets in the OT and spoke definitively in Jesus in the NT; the full story is one divine plan, not two incompatible plans.\n\n- Highlight the consistency of God’s character: God is holy and just, and in mercy he provided a salvation that meets his justice. The OT’s use of wrath against sin and the NT’s revelation of grace in the cross are complementary facets of the same God.\n\n- Point to key scriptures that unite the testaments: \n  - Luke 24:27, 44–46; Matthew 5:17–18 (Jesus fulfills the Law and the Prophets). \n  - 2 Timothy 3:16–17; 2 Peter 3:15–16 (Scripture’s unity and authority). \n  - Hebrews 1:1–2; Hebrews 8 (the continuity and fulfillment of the old covenant in the new). \n  - Deuteronomy 6:4 and James 2:19 (one God).\n\n- Clarify the nature of “wrath” and “love” in Scripture: both Testaments portray God’s wrath against evil and his profound love for his people; the NT culminates that revelation in the cross, not in a different god.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe claim “the OT God is wrathful and evil and Jesus revealed a true, good God” is not compatible with orthodox Christian teaching. It aligns with Marcionite dualism and denies the theological coherence of Scripture, the person of Christ, and the history of salvation. A robust orthodox approach affirms one God, whose character is consistently revealed across the covenants and magnificently displayed in the sending of Jesus and the gift of the Spirit.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response aligns with orthodox Christian teaching. It correctly identifies the view as a Marcionite dualism (two gods) and argues for the unity of the God of the Old and New Testaments. It accurately notes that the OT presents God’s wrath in the context of justice alongside mercy and steadfast love, and that the NT presents the cross as the culmination of God’s character (holiness, justice, mercy, love). It cites and interprets key scriptures to support continuity across covenants (e.g., Jesus’s fulfillment of the Law and Prophets; the authority and unity of Scripture; God’s ongoing purposes in history). It avoids anti-Judaism by reinforcing the OT’s ongoing relevance and the unity of God rather than proposing two deities. It also offers constructive guidance for teaching this topic with appropriate nuance (wrath as righteous judgment, the cross as revelation of God’s character, continuity between Testaments). Minor caveats could include a fuller discussion of the Mosaic law’s pedagogical purpose and progressive revelation, but these do not undermine the overall accuracy. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and captures essential nuances."
