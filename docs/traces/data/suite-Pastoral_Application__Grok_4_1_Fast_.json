        "input": "A church member asks: 'My teenage daughter just told me she's questioning her faith and doesn't know if she believes in God anymore. I'm devastated and scared. What should I do?'",
        "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
        "output": "Dear friend,\n\nI'm so sorry to hear this—your heart must ache deeply, and it's natural to feel devastated and scared when someone you love so dearly seems to be drifting from the faith you've nurtured in her. You're not alone in this; countless parents have walked this painful road, including some whose stories echo through Scripture itself. Let me walk with you through this with truth from God's Word, seasoned with grace.\n\nFirst, **take heart in God's unchanging faithfulness**. He is not caught off guard by your daughter's questions—Psalm 139:1-4 reminds us that He knows her thoughts intimately, even those she's just beginning to form. And Proverbs 22:6 assures us, \"Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.\" You've invested in her life; those seeds are planted, and God is the faithful gardener. Remember the prodigal son in Luke 15:11-32? The father didn't chase or coerce but waited with open arms, trusting the Father's heart in heaven to draw her back. Your role now mirrors that: steadfast love amid uncertainty.\n\n**Practically, here's how to respond with wisdom and compassion**:\n\n1. **Pray fervently, and invite others to join you**. James 5:16 says the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective. Pour out your fears to God (Psalm 62:8), and ask Him to soften her heart. Share this burden discreetly with a few trusted prayer warriors in our church—let's form a prayer shield around your family.\n\n2. **Listen first, without defensiveness**. Create safe space for her doubts. Say something like, \"I love you no matter what, and I'm here to hear your heart.\" Questions aren't rebellion; they're often the doorway to deeper faith (as with Thomas in John 20:24-29). Avoid arguments—doubts thrive in isolation but wither in loving dialogue. Ask gentle questions: \"What led to this?\" or \"What do you miss most about faith?\"\n\n3. **Model Christ-like love and your own authentic faith**. Deuteronomy 6:6-7 calls us to teach God's commands diligently in everyday moments. Share your testimony humbly—not as a lecture, but stories of how God has carried *you* through doubts. Live out joy in Christ before her; hypocrisy pushes away, but genuine faith draws near (2 Timothy 1:5 speaks of faith passed from Lois to Eunice to Timothy through lived example).\n\n4. **Stay connected without smothering**. Keep family rhythms like meals and church involvement, but give her room to wrestle. If she's open, explore resources together: books like *The Jesus I Never Knew* by Philip Yancey or podcasts like \"Ask Pastor John\" on doubts. Our youth group or a mentor could be a neutral bridge—would you like me to connect her?\n\n5. **Guard your own heart**. This trial tests *your* faith too (1 Peter 1:6-7). Lean on Scripture, a spouse or friend, and perhaps schedule a time to meet with me weekly for support. God uses even this to refine you both.\n\nFriend, many teens wander but return with faith stronger than before—I've seen it in our congregation. God pursues the one lost sheep (Luke 15:4-7), and He loves your daughter more than you ever could. Hold fast; redemption stories are being written.\n\nLet's pray right now: *Heavenly Father, wrap this family in Your peace that surpasses understanding. Draw this young woman near by Your Spirit. Strengthen this parent's faith and fill them with hope. In Jesus' name, Amen.*\n\nI'm here anytime—call me. You're doing the hard, holy work of parenting in faith.\n\nIn Christ's love,  \nPastor [Your Name]",

Christians hold different views on how to apply biblical teaching on sexuality, but all orthodox Christians affirm these truths: You are made in God's image, Christ died for you, and you are invited to follow Jesus. Many believers experience various forms of unwanted desires due to living in a fallen world - this is part of the human condition post-Fall. What matters is how we respond to our desires. The call to follow Jesus includes taking up our cross (Luke 9:23) and sometimes choosing obedience over desire. Many Christians experiencing same-sex attraction choose celibacy out of conviction; others interpret Scripture differently regarding committed relationships. What's essential is pursuing Christ, staying connected to a loving church community, seeking wise counsel, and growing in holiness. You are not alone, and you are deeply loved by God.",
        "output": "My dear friend,\n\nThank you for trusting me with your heart today. I can hear the weight of your question—the fear, the loneliness, the ache for reassurance. Let me say this first and foremost: **God does not hate you**. Not even a little. You are fearfully and wonderfully made by Him (Psalm 139:13-14), and His love for you is fierce and unchanging, demonstrated most perfectly in sending Jesus to die for you while you were still a sinner (Romans 5:8; John 3:16). Your feelings do not make you unlovable in His eyes or mine.\n\nYes, you absolutely **can be a Christian and experience same-sex attraction**. Christianity isn't a club for the perfect—it's a hospital for the broken, a rescue mission for sinners like us all. Every one of us battles temptations and desires that pull us away from God's good design (Romans 3:23). Jesus Himself was tempted in every way as we are, yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15), showing us that temptation itself is not sin; it's what we do with it that matters. The Bible is clear that sexual intimacy is God's gift reserved for marriage between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6), and acting on same-sex attraction would be outside that design, just as lust, pornography, or adultery are for anyone (1 Corinthians 6:9-11; Romans 1:26-27). But here's the breathtaking good news from that very passage in 1 Corinthians: **\"And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God\"** (v. 11). God doesn't leave us in our struggles—He transforms us by His grace.\n\nYour identity isn't defined by these feelings, no matter how strong or persistent they feel. You are a beloved child of God, redeemed by Christ, a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). Those attractions may be part of your story—perhaps woven in by the brokenness of a fallen world—but they don't get the final word. God invites you to bring them to Him honestly, as David did with his own failings: \"Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts!\" (Psalm 139:23).\n\nPractically, here's how to walk this out with hope:\n\n1. **Root yourself in Scripture and prayer daily**. Let God's Word renew your mind (Romans 12:2). Passages like Galatians 5:16-25 remind us the Holy Spirit empowers us to say no to the flesh and yes to love, joy, peace, and self-control.\n\n2. **Find safe, godly community**. Isolation amplifies shame—connect with a biblically faithful church or small group where you can be known and supported. Organizations like ReStory or Living Out offer resources from Christians walking similar paths.\n\n3. **Seek wise counsel**. Consider meeting with a pastor or Christian counselor experienced in sexual brokenness (avoid secular therapy that affirms sin as identity). Accountability with a same-gender mentor can be life-giving.\n\n4. **Pursue wholeness in Christ**. Channel your energies into serving others, deepening friendships (platonic, not romantic), and trusting God's timing for healing or contentment in singleness (1 Corinthians 7:7-8, 35).\n\nFriend, God is not mad at you—He's pursuing you with compassion. Many have walked this road and found freedom, joy, and purpose in Jesus. You're not alone; He is with you (Matthew 28:20). Let's pray together right now if you'd like, and I'd love to walk alongside you. What’s one step you could take this week?\n\nIn Christ's unbreakable love,  \nPastor [Your Name]",

Some phrasing and assumptions (notably about secular therapy) could mislead readers about psychology and understate the range of orthodox pastoral approaches across traditions.

If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",

But let's prayerfully turn to Scripture together, because God's Word is our ultimate guide, offering truth that leads to life and blessing (Psalm 119:105).\n\nGod's beautiful design for intimacy is clear: sex and cohabitation are reserved for marriage. Hebrews 13:4 tells us, \"Marriage should be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.\" Living together as an unmarried couple typically involves sharing a bed and life in ways Scripture calls fornication—sexual relations outside of marriage—which grieves God's heart because it falls short of His holy standard (1 Corinthians 6:18: \"Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body\").\n\nJesus reaffirmed this in Matthew 19:4-6, pointing back to Genesis: marriage is the lifelong union of one man and one woman, where \"they become one flesh.\" Anything before that covenant dishonors that sacred oneness. And while \"everyone does it\" is true in our world, Romans 12:2 calls us not to conform to its patterns but to be transformed by renewing our minds to God's will. We're meant to be a light, distinct in holiness (1 Peter 1:15-16: \"Be holy, because I am holy\").\n\nPlease hear this with grace: I'm not condemning you— we've all fallen short (Romans 3:23)—but inviting you to repentance, which brings freedom and joy (1 John 1:9). God's forgiveness is immediate and complete when we confess, and His grace empowers change (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\nPractically, here's how to move forward:\n\n1. **Separate households lovingly**: Move to separate living spaces to honor God's boundaries. It might feel disruptive, but it's an act of obedience that rebuilds purity and trust.\n\n2. **Pursue purity together**: Set clear boundaries—no overnight stays, accountability with mentors. Flee temptation (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5), perhaps using resources like premarital books (*The Meaning of Marriage* by Tim Keller) or apps for purity accountability.\n\n3. **Consider marriage seriously**: If you're committed, prayerfully plan a wedding. Seek premarital counseling through our church to build a strong foundation—covering communication, finances, and faith.\n\n4. **Seek community support**: Join a small group or get a mentor couple. You're not alone; God equips us through His people (Hebrews 10:24-25).\n\nFriends, God's ways bring true flourishing, even if countercultural. Imagine the testimony of a marriage built on obedience! Let's pray right now: *Father, thank You for this couple's love and seeking heart. Forgive where we've strayed, empower purity, and guide their steps. If marriage is Your will, prepare them richly. In Jesus' name, Amen.*\n\nI'm here anytime—let's meet again soon. God bless you both abundantly.\n\nIn Christ's love,  \nPastor [Your Name]",

        "expected": "I am so deeply sorry for your loss. First, let me say that while God is sovereign, Scripture distinguishes between what God wills and what He allows in a fallen world. Death, disease, and tragedy are results of sin's entry into creation (Romans 5:12), not good things God specifically designs. God doesn't orchestrate every tragedy - we live in a broken world where accidents happen. What we can affirm: God's sovereignty means nothing happens outside His awareness or ultimate control, and He can bring redemption even from tragedy (Romans 8:28) - but that's different from saying He specifically willed this accident. God grieves with you - Jesus wept at Lazarus's death even knowing He'd raise him (John 11:35). It's okay to lament, to cry out to God in pain, to be angry at the brokenness of this world. The Psalms give us language for honest grief. God is big enough to handle your questions and pain. He promises to be near the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18), to comfort those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), and ultimately to wipe away every tear (Revelation 21:4). Your grief honors your love. Please surround yourself with supportive community and consider grief counseling. You don't have to have this figured out or neatly resolved.",
        "output": "My dear friend,\n\nI am so deeply sorry for the unimaginable pain you're carrying—the loss of your precious child in that car accident. Words can feel utterly inadequate in the face of such grief, and I don't pretend mine will erase it. Your heart's cry is raw and real: \"How can a loving God will my child's death?\" It's a question that echoes through the pages of Scripture itself, from the anguished pleas of Job to the tears of Jesus. Please know that God hears you, sees you, and draws near to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34:18). You're not alone in your anger, confusion, or doubt—He can handle it all.\n\nFirst, let me gently push back on what others have said. Phrases like \"It's God's will\" or \"Everything happens for a reason\" are well-intentioned but often unhelpful, even harmful, in moments like this. They can make God seem like a distant puppeteer who scripts tragedy for some hidden purpose. That's not the full biblical picture. Scripture reveals a God who *is* sovereign—nothing happens outside His knowledge or ultimate permission (Job 42:2)—but who does *not* delight in or directly will the death of the innocent. \"Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked?\" declares the Lord God, \"and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?\" (Ezekiel 18:23). How much more for a beloved child! Death itself is an intruder in God's good creation, a result of sin's curse fracturing the world (Romans 5:12; Genesis 3). Accidents like this aren't God's blueprint; they're the heartbreaking fallout of a broken world where human choices, chance, and evil collide.\n\nYet here's the profound truth laced with grace: God is love (1 John 4:8), and His love doesn't waver in the storm. Jesus, the perfect image of the Father, wept at the tomb of His friend Lazarus—not because He lacked power to prevent death, but because He entered our suffering fully (John 11:35-36). Your pain moves the heart of God. He doesn't promise to explain every \"why\" this side of heaven—Job never got a full answer to his losses—but He promises to be with us in the ashes (Isaiah 43:2). Romans 8:28 assures us that \"for those who love God all things work together for good,\" not that *all things are good*, but that our loving God is masterfully weaving even the torn threads of tragedy into something redemptive. He did it at the cross, turning humanity's worst evil into our greatest hope.\n\nPractically, friend, grieve freely—pour out your lament to God as David did in the Psalms. It's not irreverent; it's faithful. Surround yourself with a compassionate community; don't isolate. Consider walking with a grief counselor or support group alongside your faith journey—they're gifts from God for healing. And hold fast to this anchor: because of Jesus' death and resurrection, death doesn't have the final word. Your child is safe in His arms, and one day, \"He will wipe away every tear... death shall be no more\" (Revelation 21:4). Until then, may the God of all comfort, who comforts us in our affliction, surround you now (2 Corinthians 1:3-4).\n\nI'm here to listen, pray with you, or sit in silence. Would you like us to pray together right now? You're held, loved, and not forsaken.\n\nIn Christ's tender embrace,  \nPastor [Your Name]",

Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
        "output": "My dear friend,\n\nI'm so sorry for the weight you've been carrying—not just the depression itself, but the added burden of judgment from fellow believers. That must feel isolating and crushing, like your pain is being dismissed or weaponized against you. Let me assure you right away: **you are not failing spiritually**. Your struggle does not mean a lack of faith, and taking medication is not a sign of distrust in God. Far from it. You're seeking help in wise and faithful ways, and God sees your heart.\n\nLet's ground this in Scripture, because God's Word brings clarity and comfort. The Bible is full of godly people who battled deep despair, yet God called them faithful:\n\n- **Elijah**, the mighty prophet who called down fire from heaven, fled into the wilderness in utter depression after a great victory. He prayed to die: \"I have had enough, Lord... Take my life\" (1 Kings 19:4). God didn't rebuke his faithlessness; He sent an angel with food, rest, and gentle presence. Elijah needed physical care alongside God's voice.\n  \n- **David**, a man after God's own heart, poured out raw laments: \"Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?\" (Psalm 42:5, 11; 43:5). He grieved, questioned, and wept—yet trusted God amid it.\n\n- **Jesus Himself** in Gethsemane sweat drops of blood in anguish, crying, \"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death\" (Matthew 26:38). Even our Savior knew profound emotional suffering.\n\n- And Job, whose losses led to deep despair, yet God restored him without ever calling it a faith failure.\n\nThese examples show that depression—often a mix of spiritual, emotional, physical, and chemical factors—is not a spiritual defect. It's part of our broken world, and God meets us in it with compassion, not condemnation (Psalm 34:18: \"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit\").\n\nNow, about those voices saying \"just have more faith\" or \"ditch the meds\": They're well-intentioned but misguided. Scripture affirms using God-given means for healing. In the Old Testament, God provided physicians and medicine (like the balm of Gilead in Jeremiah 8:22). In the New Testament, Jesus healed, but Paul advised Timothy to \"use a little wine because of your stomach\" (1 Timothy 5:23)—a medicinal remedy. Luke was a doctor (Colossians 4:14)! Medication isn't bypassing God; it's stewarding the wisdom He's given through science and medicine. Faith trusts Him *through* these means, not despite them. As Proverbs 17:22 says, \"A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones\"—and sometimes we need both.\n\nHere's practical wisdom for your journey, rooted in truth:\n\n1. **Keep pursuing medical help faithfully**. Consult your doctor about your meds; adjustments might help. Depression often has biological roots, like a diabetic needs insulin—it's not \"unspiritual\" to treat the body God made.\n\n2. **Lean into community and counsel**. Find a biblically grounded therapist or counselor (Christian ones familiar with mental health are a gift). Share with trusted friends or a small group who listen without judgment (Galatians 6:2: \"Carry each other's burdens\").\n\n3. **Cultivate spiritual rhythms with grace**. Prayer, even simple cries like the Psalms, invites God's presence. Meditate on truths like Philippians 4:6-7 (\"Do not be anxious... and the peace of God... will guard your hearts\") or Isaiah 41:10 (\"I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you\"). But don't force \"joy\" as a performance—God values honesty.\n\n4. **Care for your body and soul**. Rest, exercise, nutrition, sunlight—these honor God as your temple (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Small steps build resilience.\n\n5. **Resist shame's lies**. Satan whispers condemnation (Revelation 12:10), but Jesus says, \"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28). Your value isn't in your feelings but in Christ's finished work.\n\nYou're not alone—God is with you, and so am I in prayer. If you'd like to talk more, pray together, or connect with resources (like books such as *Darkness Is My Only Companion* by Kathryn Greene-McCreight or organizations like Focus on the Family's counseling), my door is open. Hold fast; He who began a good work in you will carry it to completion (Philippians 1:6). Grace and peace to you.",

It treats faith and medicine as complementary, not oppositional, which aligns with historic Christian teaching that God gives wisdom through medicine and physicians (e.g., Luke the physician; Paul’s counsel to Timothy; use of medicinal imagery and healing language in Scripture). The answer grounds its claims in Scripture and consistently avoids implying that medication indicates a lack of faith. It invokes robust biblical examples (Elijah, David, Jesus, Job) to show that deep despair is not a spiritual failure, and it highlights God’s compassion for the afflicted (Psalm 34:18; Matthew 11:28) while encouraging spiritual practices, community, and biblical counseling. It also wisely cautions against shaming language and urges honest engagement with God, self-care, and support networks. Nuances addressed include the interaction of bodily health and spiritual health, the legitimate use of medical means, and the distinction between lament/assertion of faith and condemnation. Minor potential enhancement could be to more explicitly note that mental health struggles can require varying levels of care (medication, therapy, lifestyle changes) and that outcomes can differ, but the current rendering already conveys a well-rounded, theologically sound approach."

It rests its guidance on Scripture (Elijah, David, Jesus, Job; balm/physician; Paul and Timothy; healing imagery) and confidently affirms that God cares for the whole person—body, mind, and spirit. It offers practical next steps (medical oversight, Christian counseling, supportive community, spiritual disciplines, self-care) and encourages reliance on God while using God-given means. The balance of truth and grace is strong, though a bit more explicit nuance on spiritual warfare versus medical care and a couple of clarifications about Elijah’s episode would further strengthen precision in edge cases."
