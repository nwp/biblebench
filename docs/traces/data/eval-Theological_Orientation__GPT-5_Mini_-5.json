    "input": "What does the Bible teach about headship in marriage? Does Ephesians 5:22-33 establish hierarchy or mutual submission?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Short answer\nEphesians 5:22–33 must be read in the context of 5:21 (“submit to one another…”) and the whole New Testament witness. The passage portrays a relationship shaped by Christ‑like, sacrificial love and mutual responsibility. Whether it establishes a permanent hierarchical authority (a husband’s unilateral rule) or a covenantal ordering of roles within an equal partnership is debated among careful, faithful readers. But both major readings agree that the husband’s “headship” cannot be used to justify domination, neglect, or abuse and that the passage centers on self‑giving love and the unity of “one flesh.”\n\nWhat the text says and its immediate context\n- Ephesians 5:21 begins the section with the injunction: “Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.” That mutual submission frames what follows.\n- Wives are told to “submit to your own husbands as to the Lord” (v.22) and husbands are commanded to “love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her” (v.25), with images of nourishing, cherishing, and sanctifying the wife (vv. 23–33).\n- The marriage analogy is explicitly Christ–church: the husband is called the church’s “head” as Christ is the church’s head (v.23); the unity of husband and wife (“one flesh”) is emphasized (v.31).\n\nTwo broad interpretive traditions\n1. Complementarian (hierarchical functional ordering)\n- Main claim: Paul prescribes a functional order within marriage: the husband is the head in a leadership/authority sense, and the wife is called to submit to that leadership.\n- Important qualifications in most complementarian formulations: the husband’s authority is to be exercised in imitation of Christ’s self‑giving, servant leadership — loving, sacrificial, protective, and serving, not domineering or tyrannical. The husband bears heavy responsibility before God for the spiritual and practical care of the family.\n- Supportive texts cited: Ephesians 5; 1 Corinthians 11:3 (Paul: “Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman”); 1 Timothy 2:12–14 and the creation-order arguments Paul sometimes appeals to.\n\n2. Egalitarian (mutuality and partnership)\n- Main claim: Ephesians is best read under the umbrella of 5:21’s reciprocal submission and Paul’s emphasis elsewhere on mutuality and equality in Christ (Galatians 3:28). “Head” (Greek kephalē) is argued by some to mean “source” or to be metaphorical emphasizing role-modeling rather than authority hierarchy; the net thrust is mutual, reciprocal submission and sacrificial love rather than a permanent power differential.\n- Egalitarians point to the strong command that husbands love sacrificially (a costly, subordinate kind of love) and to the social and literary context (household codes and Greco‑Roman norms) as reasons Paul chose to redefine roles in mutual, gospel‑shaping ways rather than to affirm a rigid hierarchy.\n\nKey interpretive issues\n- Meaning of “head” (kephalē): Does it primarily mean “authority/leader” or “source/origin/model”? Linguistically and historically scholars argue both sides; usage is mixed in ancient literature and the best reading depends on context.\n- Role of 5:21: If the passage flows from mutual submission, how are particular commands to be balanced with that principle? Complementarians say specific role distinctions coexist with mutual service; egalitarians say mutual submission is the governing principle that recasts any asymmetrical language.\n- Paul’s broader theology: Creation order texts (Genesis) and other Pauline passages (1 Cor 11, 1 Tim 2) factor into one’s conclusion; different traditions weigh those passages and their contexts differently.\n\nPastoral and theological emphases that are widely agreed upon\n- Headship is not license for abuse. Both traditions reject using these texts to justify coercion, control, or neglect.\n- The ideal is sacrificial, sanctifying love. Paul’s central image is Christ’s self‑giving love for the church and the church’s responsive submission — a pattern of mutual transformation, holiness, and unity.\n- Marriage is covenantal and mutual: “one flesh” and shared life before God are repeated emphases in Scripture.\n- Practical application should guard against cultural distortion: whether one speaks of “headship” as leadership or as source/modeling, the ethic is costly service, humility, and mutual care.\n\nA balanced conclusion\nEphesians 5:22–33 establishes a distinctive ordering for married life that links a husband’s role to the image of Christ’s headship and a wife’s role to a respectful, ordered response within that covenantal union. How that ordering is described theologically — as a permanent functional hierarchy of authority or as a gospel‑shaped mutual submission with different role emphases — is a legitimate and long‑standing debate among evangelical and broader Christian interpreters. What is not open to debate in a faithful reading is that marriage is meant to display the gospel: sacrificial love, mutual submission to Christ, and the sanctifying care of one another.",
