        "input": "Can a woman serve as the senior pastor of a church?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "The answer to whether a woman can serve as the senior pastor of a church **depends entirely on the specific denomination, local church, and its interpretation of scripture and tradition.** There is no single Christian answer.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the landscape:\n\n1.  **Denominations that Ordain Women as Senior Pastors:**\n    *   **Mainline Protestant Denominations:** The Episcopal Church (USA), Presbyterian Church (USA) (PCUSA), United Methodist Church (UMC), Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), United Church of Christ (UCC), American Baptist Churches USA (ABCUSA), and many others ordain women as elders/pastors and allow them to serve as senior pastors.\n    *   **Biblical Justification:** These denominations generally interpret scripture to affirm women's equality and calling to leadership. They point to:\n        *   Galatians 3:28: \"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" (Argues for equality in Christ).\n        *   Examples of Female Leaders: Deborah (Judge), Junia (Apostle), Phoebe (Deacon), Priscilla (Teacher), Philip's daughters (Prophetesses).\n        *   Jesus' Interactions: Jesus consistently treated women as equals, taught them directly, and included them as disciples and witnesses to key events (including the Resurrection).\n        *   Interpretation of Restrictive Passages: They often view passages like 1 Timothy 2:12 (\"I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet\") as culturally specific (addressing issues in the Ephesian church), not universally binding, or as referring to false teaching, not general ministry.\n        *   Theological Argument: They see the Holy Spirit gifting women for leadership just as men, and restricting them based on gender is seen as denying God's call and the Spirit's work.\n\n2.  **Denominations that Restrict the Senior Pastor Role to Men:**\n    *   **Complementarian Denominations:** Many conservative Evangelical, Pentecostal, and Fundamentalist denominations hold a \"complementarian\" view. This includes:\n        *   Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) - While individual churches have autonomy, the official convention stance and many affiliated seminaries restrict the pastorate to men. Most local SBC churches follow this.\n        *   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) - All priesthood offices are restricted to men.\n        *   Many non-denominational churches, Pentecostal denominations (like the Assemblies of God, though some individual churches may differ), and conservative Presbyterian (PCA), Baptist (like the Conservative Baptist Network), and Methodist (like the Global Methodist Church) bodies.\n    *   **Biblical Justification:** These denominations base their stance primarily on:\n        *   1 Timothy 2:12-15: Interpreted as a universal principle that women should not have authority over men in the church, specifically the role of teaching/leading men.\n        *   Creation Order (Genesis 2-3): Adam created first, then Eve; Eve was deceived (1 Tim 2:14). Seen as establishing a pattern of male headship.\n        *   Role Distinction: They believe God created distinct roles for men and women in both marriage (husband as head) and the church (male leadership). Senior Pastor is seen as an office of authority over men, thus restricted to qualified men.\n        *   Argument from Nature: Often argue that men and women have God-given different natures suited to these roles.\n\n3.  **Independent/Non-Denominational Churches:**\n    *   These vary widely. Some ordain women and have female senior pastors. Others restrict the role to men based on the pastor's interpretation of scripture or tradition. It depends entirely on the specific church's leadership and beliefs.\n\n**Practical Considerations:**\n\n*   **Even Where Allowed:** Women in senior pastor roles may still face challenges, biases, or questions within congregations, especially in more traditionally conservative areas or denominations transitioning.\n*   **Call and Qualification:** The primary theological argument across *all* traditions is whether the individual (man or woman) is genuinely called by God, theologically sound, spiritually mature, and possesses the necessary leadership and teaching gifts. The gender question is layered *on top* of these fundamental qualifications.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\n*   **Yes, in many denominations and churches** (Mainline Protestants, some non-denominational, some progressive Evangelicals).\n*   **No, in many other denominations and churches** (Conservative Evangelicals, Southern Baptists, Mormons, some Pentecostals, some non-denominational).\n*   **It depends on the specific church's doctrine and interpretation.**\n\nTo know the answer for a *specific* church, you need to look at its denomination's official stance (if applicable) or its own doctrinal statement and practices.",
