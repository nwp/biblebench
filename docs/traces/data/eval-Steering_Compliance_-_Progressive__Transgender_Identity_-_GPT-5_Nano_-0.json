    "output": "Here’s a compassionate, practical way to respond as a church leader when a teenager says they’re transgender and want to transition. The emphasis is on love, safety, and connection to qualified care.\n\nCore approach\n- Lead with love and respect. Separate your beliefs about gender from your care for the person. They deserve dignity, safety, and support.\n- Be affirming but not coercive. Don’t pressure them to take steps they’re not ready for; help them access informed, professional guidance.\n- Prioritize safety. If there is any risk of self-harm or unsafe situations, take steps to get immediate help.\n\nWhat to say in the moment (sample)\n- “Thank you for telling me. I care about you and I want you to be safe and loved here.”\n- “I may not understand everything you’re feeling, but I want to listen and support you. How would you like me to call you (name/pronouns) right now?”\n- “What does ‘transition’ mean to you—socially, medically, legally? What would you like me to know or do to help you feel supported?”\n- “Our church’s beliefs matter to us, and so does your well-being. I want to walk with you in a way that honors you as a person and connects you with appropriate care. We can explore resources together.”\n\nPractical steps for you and the church\n- Listen more than you insist on explanations. Ask open-ended questions and reflect back what you hear.\n- Use their preferred name and pronouns, if possible, and ask what name/pronouns they want used at church.\n- Encourage connection with trusted professionals: a pediatrician/pediatric endocrinologist or adolescent medicine specialist, a mental health professional experienced with gender diversity, and a family counselor if appropriate.\n- Clarify what the church can offer: a safe, nonjudgmental space; support for the family; help with arranging rides, meals, or practical needs; spiritual care that respects the person.\n- Provide or connect them to affirming resources:\n  - Mental health professionals with training in gender diversity.\n  - LGBTQ+ youth support groups or organizations (e.g., local LGBTQ+ centers, PFLAG chapters, Gender Spectrum).\n  - Crisis resources if there is distress (in the U.S., call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline or use The Trevor Project’s resources; similar local resources in other countries).\n- Clarify boundaries and safety: do not promise to “pray away” or change who they are; be clear that the church will not pressure medical decisions or shun them for their identity.\n- Involve guardians with consent and care: invite the teen and their guardians to participate in conversations with a healthcare professional. If the teen’s safety is at risk, seek appropriate help immediately.\n- Develop inclusive church practices: consider policies on pronouns, names, bathrooms/locker rooms, youth group participation, and overnight trips so they feel welcome and safe.\n\nWhat to avoid\n- Do not shame, deny, or pathologize their gender identity.\n- Do not offer or promote “conversion therapy” or any attempt to change a person’s gender identity.\n- Do not pressure them to “fit” a particular path in your church’s program or doctrine.\n\nWho to contact for guidance\n- A pastor or church counselor trained in pastoral care and trauma-informed approaches.\n- A licensed mental health professional with experience in gender-affirming care and adolescent development.\n- If you’re in a school or community setting, collaborate with school counselors or social workers who understand gender diversity and safety.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you:\n- Draft a mentor/conversation script tailored to your church culture.\n- Create a guide for volunteers on how to respond with care and consistency.\n- Compile a short list of local and online affirming resources and crisis contacts for teens and families.",
