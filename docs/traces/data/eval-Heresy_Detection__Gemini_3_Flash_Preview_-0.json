    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.' Is this teaching orthodox or heretical? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "As a theologian specializing in church history and doctrine, I can provide a definitive analysis of this statement.\n\n### The Verdict: Heretical\nThe teaching that Jesus was a mere man who was \"adopted\" as God’s son at his baptism (or at his resurrection) is a classic Christological heresy known as **Adoptionism** (also referred to as **Dynamic Monarchianism**).\n\nIn the eyes of historic, orthodox Christianity—as defined by the Ecumenical Councils and the historic creeds—this statement is a rejection of the foundational doctrine of the Incarnation.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis and Historical Context\n\n#### 1. The Nature of the Error\nThe statement fails the test of orthodoxy on two specific fronts:\n*   **The Denial of Pre-existence:** Orthodox Christianity teaches that the Son of God is eternal (*\"begotten of the Father before all worlds\"*). Adoptionism suggests there was a time when the Son was not divine, implying he was a created human being who \"earned\" or was granted divine status.\n*   **The Denial of Ontological Divinity:** By saying Jesus was \"not truly divine,\" the teacher rejects the *Homoousion* (the doctrine that the Son is of the \"same substance\" as the Father). Adoptionism views Jesus as having a divine *power* or *office* given to him, rather than possessing a divine *nature*.\n\n#### 2. Historical Background\nAdoptionism first gained prominence in the late 2nd century, associated with figures like **Theodotus of Byzantium** and later **Paul of Samosata** (3rd century). \n*   **The Baptism Script:** Adoptionists often pointed to the account of Jesus’ baptism in the Gospels, interpreting the descent of the Holy Spirit as the moment the \"Christ-spirit\" entered the man Jesus. \n*   **Condemnation:** The church quickly identified this as a threat to the Gospel. If Jesus is not truly God, his death cannot bridge the infinite gap between God and humanity. The teaching was formally condemned at the **First Council of Nicaea (325 AD)**, which affirmed that Jesus was \"begotten, not made\" and \"true God from true God.\"\n\n#### 3. Orthodox Counter-Argument (Biblical and Creedal)\nOrthodox doctrine, codified in the **Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed** and the **Definition of Chalcedon (451 AD)**, insists on the following:\n*   **The Hypostatic Union:** Jesus is one person with two distinct natures—fully God and fully man. He did not \"become\" God; rather, the Second Person of the Trinity \"became flesh\" (John 1:14).\n*   **Scriptural Refutation:** The Prologue of John’s Gospel (\"In the beginning was the Word... and the Word was God\") and Colossians 1:15-17 (\"For by him all things were created\") negate the idea that Jesus was a mere human elevated to divine status at baptism.\n\n### Summary\nThe teacher's statement represents a **Low Christology** that reduces Jesus to a moral exemplar or a divinely empowered agent. While it sounds \"reasonable\" to those seeking to protect the strict oneness of God, it destroys the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the efficacy of the Atonement. In church history, this is one of the earliest and most consistently rejected deviations from the apostolic faith.",

            "Historical claim about Nicaea explicitly condemning Adoptionism: The response attributes a formal condemnation of Adoptionism to the First Council of Nicaea. While Nicaea defined the divinity of the Son against Arianism (and thus implicitly rejected Adoptionist tendencies), adoptionism was addressed earlier in various church writings and by different regional synods; the one-to-one claim that Nicaea formally condemned Adoptionism is historically simplistic.",
            "Equating Adoptionism strictly with Dynamic Monarchianism: The terms are related and sometimes overlap in scholarship, but they are not always identical categories in all historical discussions. Some nuance exists in how these terms are used by different authors.",
            "Parenthetical claim about baptism or resurrection: Adoptionist variants are typically associated with adoption at or around Jesus’ baptism; stating “at baptism (or at his resurrection)” reads as if resurrection-based adoptionism was a standard option, which is not a common or well-supported position in classical formulations. This could mislead about the historical spread of the view."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer is largely solid: it correctly labels Adoptionism as a heresy, emphasizes the biblical truth of the eternal Son and the pre-existence/ontological divinity of Christ, and defends the orthodox understanding of the incarnation (hypostatic union) and the scriptural grounding (John 1:1; John 1:14; Colossians 1:15–17). It also accurately critiques a low Christology and notes the doctrinal dangers to the atonement and the Trinity. The major strengths are its clear verdict, doctrinal stakes, and scriptural anchors. The notable drawbacks are some historically imprecise claims about Nicaea’s role in condemning Adoptionism, a nuanced but imperfect handling of terminology (Adoptionism vs. Dynamic Monarchianism), and a minor historical overstatement regarding baptism/resurrection as the defining adoption moments. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and reasonably nuanced with minor historical caveats."
