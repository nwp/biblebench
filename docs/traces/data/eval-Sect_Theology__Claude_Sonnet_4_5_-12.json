    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "# Analysis of \"Jesus Name Only\" Baptism\n\n## The Oneness Pentecostal Position\n\nOneness Pentecostals teach that water baptism must be administered using the formula \"in the name of Jesus\" (or similar variation) and that the Trinitarian formula (\"in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\") is invalid or incomplete. This teaching is rooted in their non-Trinitarian theology.\n\n## Scriptural Evidence\n\n### Matthew 28:19 - The Great Commission\n**\"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\"**\n\nThis is Jesus' explicit instruction on baptism. Key observations:\n- Direct command from Christ himself\n- Singular \"name\" with three persons indicates unity\n- This is prescriptive (a command), not merely descriptive\n\n### Acts Passages\nOneness theology appeals to several passages:\n- Acts 2:38 - \"be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ\"\n- Acts 8:16 - \"baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus\"\n- Acts 10:48 - \"baptized in the name of Jesus Christ\"\n- Acts 19:5 - \"baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus\"\n\n### How Orthodox Christianity Understands This\n\n**The phrases are complementary, not contradictory:**\n\n1. **Technical vs. Summary Language**: The Acts passages likely describe baptism done by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith, rather than giving the exact liturgical formula spoken. Luke is summarizing what kind of baptism occurred (Christian baptism, as opposed to John's baptism).\n\n2. **Historical Context**: Acts distinguishes Christian baptism from Jewish ritual washings and John's baptism. Saying someone was baptized \"in Jesus' name\" identified it as Christian baptism.\n\n3. **No Contradiction**: Early Christians wouldn't have seen conflict between Matthew 28:19 and Acts passages. They understood baptism \"in Jesus' name\" meant baptism according to Jesus' command—which included the Trinitarian formula.\n\n## Early Church Practice\n\nThe historical record is conclusive:\n\n**The Didache** (c. 50-120 AD):\n\"Baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\"\n\n**Justin Martyr** (c. 150 AD):\nDescribes Trinitarian baptism formula\n\n**Tertullian, Hippolytus, Cyprian** (2nd-3rd centuries):\nAll attest to the Trinitarian formula\n\nThere is **no evidence** of \"Jesus name only\" baptism in the early church fathers.\n\n## Theological Issues\n\n### 1. **Authority of Christ's Command**\nIf Jesus explicitly commanded the Trinitarian formula in Matthew 28:19, by what authority would the church change it?\n\n### 2. **The Trinitarian Issue**\nThis baptismal formula reflects the underlying theological dispute. Oneness theology denies the Trinity, viewing Father, Son, and Spirit as modes or manifestations of one person rather than three distinct persons in one God.\n\n**Orthodox position**: The baptismal formula reflects Trinitarian reality—one name (divine nature/essence) shared by three distinct persons.\n\n### 3. **Validity of Baptism**\nHistoric Christianity has recognized Trinitarian baptism as valid across denominational lines. The \"Jesus name only\" formula:\n- Departs from Christ's explicit instruction\n- Reflects non-Trinitarian theology rejected at Nicaea (325 AD)\n- Creates unnecessary division in the body of Christ\n\n## Orthodox Christian Conclusion\n\n**Scripture teaches:**\n1. Jesus commanded baptism in the Trinitarian formula (Matthew 28:19)\n2. Acts describes baptisms as being \"in Jesus' name\" as a summary/descriptive phrase indicating Christian baptism by Jesus' authority\n3. There is no contradiction when properly understood\n\n**Historical practice:**\nThe universal practice of the early church was Trinitarian baptism, confirming this interpretation.\n\n**Theological concern:**\nThe \"Jesus name only\" position:\n- Contradicts the clear command of Matthew 28:19\n- Lacks historical support in early Christianity\n- Stems from a non-Trinitarian theology rejected by orthodox Christianity\n- Makes invalid what Christ and the historic church have affirmed as valid\n\n## Respectful Clarification\n\nOneness Pentecostals are sincere believers who love Jesus and often demonstrate genuine faith and spiritual devotion. However, on this particular doctrine, orthodox Christianity must respectfully disagree, holding that:\n\n- The Trinitarian formula is biblically commanded\n- It has been universally practiced since apostolic times\n- The \"Jesus name only\" position represents a departure from both Scripture rightly interpreted and historic Christian orthodoxy",

          "rationale": "The response accurately represents the core biblical and historic Christian position: Matthew 28:19 commands a Trinitarian baptism, while Acts describes baptisms historically as Christian baptism often summarized as done in Jesus’ authority (e.g., in the name of Jesus Christ). It correctly notes that early church practice and patristic sources (Didache, Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Hippolytus, Cyprian) reflect Trinitarian formulae, not “Jesus name only.” It also appropriately shows that the Acts instances are best understood as descriptive of baptismal practice under Christ’s authority rather than a strict liturgical mandate, and that a long-standing historical consensus affirms Trinitarian baptism across denominations. The analysis acknowledges the Oneness position and provides a respectful, theologically orthodox critique, emphasizing the authority of Christ’s command, continuity with apostolic teaching, and the unity of the Triune God. Minor caveats exist in the nuances of biblical phrasing (e.g., “in the name” as a formula vs. authority) which the text handles reasonably, but the overall handling is solid and biblically grounded. Overall, the answer aligns with Orthodox Christian teaching and historical practice, with nuanced engagement of scripture and history.}"
