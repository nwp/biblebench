    "input": "Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science, wrote 'Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,' which Christian Scientists study alongside the Bible as authoritative revelation. What's the orthodox Christian perspective on this?",
    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity rejects placing any human writing on par with Scripture's unique divine authority. While commentaries, theological works, and devotional writings can be helpful, the Bible alone is the inspired, inerrant Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16-17). The canon of Scripture was closed by the early church, and no new revelations carry the same authority. Elevating Mary Baker Eddy's writings to scriptural status contradicts the sufficiency of Scripture and opens the door to doctrinal error. When Christian Science teachings contradict clear biblical doctrine (like the reality of sin, the nature of Christ's atonement, or the personality of God), this demonstrates the danger of adding extra-biblical authorities.",
    "output": "Short answer\nOrthodox Christianity (whether Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or historically rooted Protestantism) does not accept Mary Baker Eddy’s Science and Health as authoritative revelation on a par with the Bible. While Christian Science shares some concerns that resonate with Christians (reverence for Jesus, regular Bible study, prayer, moral earnestness, and an emphasis on healing), it departs from historic Christian teaching on several core doctrines (the nature of God, Christ, revelation, sin, atonement, and the created order). Those departures, from the vantage point of orthodox doctrine, place Christian Science outside historic Christian orthodoxy.\n\nWhat Christian Science teaches (briefly)\n- Science and Health functions in Christian Science as a companion, interpretive, and authoritative textbook written by Mary Baker Eddy. Many adherents treat its teachings as essential to correct understanding of the Bible.\n- Key emphases: God as Mind or Principle; the world, including sin, sickness, and death, is ultimately unreal or illusory; spiritual understanding (right thinking/prayer) heals; Jesus is the “Way-shower” or supreme example of healing and spiritual truth; Eddy’s discoveries are presented as corrections of traditional errors and as a new, scientific spiritual method.\n\nWhere there is agreement with orthodox Christianity\n- High regard for the Bible as spiritually central and for prayer.\n- Sincere commitment to moral transformation and to spiritual healing and compassion.\n- Rejection of crude materialism and a conviction that spiritual reality is primary.\n- Emphasis on the power of faith and the importance of inner spiritual life.\n\nMajor doctrinal departures from orthodox Christianity\n- Revelation and authority: Orthodox Christianity holds the Bible (together with apostolic Tradition in Catholic and Orthodox thought; Scripture alone interpreted by the Church in classical Protestantism) to be the divinely authoritative revelation. Mary Baker Eddy’s book is treated by Christian Scientists as an authoritative, clarifying companion to Scripture. Historic Christianity does not accept a modern private author’s book as inspired revelation or as having the same canonical authority as Scripture.\n- The triune God: Christian Science’s description of God as impersonal Principle or Mind departs from the classical doctrine of the triune, personal God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) who is relational and personal. The doctrine of the Trinity and God’s personal, loving character are central to orthodox faith.\n- Christology: Orthodox Christianity affirms Jesus as the incarnate Son of God—fully God and fully human (Chalcedonian Christology). Christian Science tends to spiritualize Jesus’ identity, treating the “Christ” as divine idea or manifestation and not affirming the historic incarnation, the complete union of divine and human natures, in the same way. That affects doctrines about the uniqueness of Jesus’ person and work.\n- Sin and the Fall: Christian Science generally denies inherited or ontological sin and treats sin as error or false belief to be corrected by right thinking. Orthodox Christianity teaches that sin is a real condition that affects human nature (the doctrine of original sin in many traditions), requiring divine mercy and reconciliation.\n- Atonement: Christian Science rejects penal substitution and sacrificial models of atonement; healing comes by correct understanding rather than by Christ’s substitutionary death. Orthodox Christianity has various understandings of atonement (ransom, Christus Victor, substitution, moral influence), but all affirm that Jesus’ death and resurrection are the decisive act of God for human reconciliation and forgiveness in a way Christian Science does not.\n- Resurrection and bodily reality: Christian Science’s metaphysical view minimizes the ontological significance of material death and bodily resurrection. Orthodox Christianity confesses the bodily resurrection and the redemption of the created order (not merely spiritualized survival).\n- Sacramental and communal life: Christian Science lacks the sacramental, liturgical, ecclesial structures that are central to Catholic, Orthodox, and many Protestant churches; healing and spiritual authority are primarily individualized and mediated through Eddy’s teachings.\n\nHow historic Christian traditions have responded\n- Most historic Christian communions do not recognize Christian Science as within the bounds of orthodox Christianity because of the doctrinal divergences above—especially regarding the Trinity, the incarnation, the nature of sin, and Scripture’s authority.\n- Catholic and Orthodox authorities treat Science and Health as private writings that could be studied critically but not as revelation. Protestant bodies (especially those asserting sola scriptura) generally reject any teaching that elevates a post-biblical work to the status of inspired authority.\n\nPastoral and ecumenical tone\n- It is possible to acknowledge the sincere religious impulses in Christian Science—devotion to spiritual growth, Bible reading, prayer, and caring for the sick—while also pointing out that its theological framework reinterprets or rejects core elements of Christian faith as historically received.\n- Dialogue and encounter are best conducted respectfully, listening to lived faith and practices, while carefully and clearly distinguishing which beliefs are shared and which are incompatible with historic Christian doctrine.\n\nConclusion\nChristian Science contains elements that resonate with Christian spirituality (prayer, moral seriousness, concern for healing), but its metaphysical reinterpretation of God, Christ, sin, and revelation departs significantly from the doctrines articulated in the Creeds and the New Testament witness as understood by historic Christianity. For that reason, orthodox Christianity does not accept Science and Health as a divinely authoritative or canonical companion to Scripture.",

            "The statement about the canon being 'closed by the early church' is a simplification. Catholic and Orthodox theology affirm that revelation is complete in Christ but continue to hold that Scripture is interpreted within Sacred Tradition; Protestants generally emphasize sola Scriptura. This nuance could be stated more precisely.",
            "The summary of Mary Baker Eddy’s Christology is described in broad terms (Christ as an idea or divine principle) and Jesus as a ‘Way-shower.’ While accurate in spirit, the description risks oversimplifying Eddy’s nuanced claims about the incarnation and the role of Christ, which are contested and debated among scholars and Christian Scientists themselves.",
            " The response would be stronger with explicit biblical citations to ground the claims (e.g., Trinity in Matt 28:19, incarnation in John 1:14, atonement in Romans 3–5) to demonstrate how orthodox teaching aligns with Scripture rather than appealing to general doctrinal consensus alone."
          ],
          "rationale": "The answer accurately portrays the orthodox critique of Christian Science and identifies core doctrinal disagreements (nature of God, Christology, sin, atonement, resurrection, authority of Scripture). It also notes areas of approximate agreement (Bible centrality, prayer, moral life). The main strengths are fidelity to historic orthodoxy and nuance about the decline of doctrinal authority in CS. Minor caveats include a simplified treatment of canon/Tradition, a succinct but potentially reductive summary of Eddy’s Christology, and the absence of explicit scriptural grounding. Overall, the assessment is solid and well-aligned with historic Christian teaching, warranting a high score with the noted caveats."
