    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.' Is this teaching orthodox or heretical? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "**Heretical.**\n\nThis teaching, known historically as **Adoptionism** (or dynamic monarchianism), directly contradicts core orthodox Christian doctrines affirmed in Scripture, the ecumenical councils, and the historic creeds. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n### 1. **Denial of Christ's Eternal Divinity**\n   - **Orthodox Teaching**: Jesus Christ is the eternal, uncreated Son of God—fully divine and co-equal with the Father from eternity past. He is \"true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being [homoousios] with the Father\" (Nicene Creed, AD 325/381). This is rooted in passages like John 1:1–14 (\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word *was God*... and the Word became flesh\"), John 8:58 (\"Before Abraham was, I AM\"), Colossians 2:9 (\"For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily\"), and Hebrews 1:3 (\"He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature\").\n   - **The Heresy**: Claiming Jesus \"was not truly divine\" reduces him to a human prophet elevated later, denying his pre-existence and intrinsic deity. This echoes Ebionite views (1st–2nd centuries) that Jesus was merely a righteous man empowered by God.\n\n### 2. **Misinterpretation of \"Adoption\" at Baptism**\n   - **Orthodox Teaching**: Jesus' sonship is eternal, not adoptive. The baptismal voice (\"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,\" Matthew 3:17) declares and manifests his pre-existent divine sonship to humanity, not an ontological change. Christ's divinity was not conferred; it was veiled in his humanity until the Incarnation (Philippians 2:6–11).\n   - **The Heresy**: Adoptionism posits Jesus became God's Son *at baptism* (or sometimes resurrection), implying a shift from mere humanity to divinity. This was taught by figures like Theodotus of Byzantium (late 2nd century) and Paul of Samosata (condemned at Antioch, AD 268). It undermines the virgin birth (Luke 1:35: \"the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God\") and implies God \"adopts\" a creature, bordering on polytheism or Arianism.\n\n### 3. **Historical Condemnation**\n   - Adoptionism was rejected early:\n     - **3rd century**: Condemned at synods against Paul of Samosata.\n     - **4th century**: Nicaea (AD 325) and Constantinople (AD 381) explicitly countered it by affirming Christ's eternal generation.\n     - **Later echoes**: Condemned in the West (e.g., against Elipandus of Toledo, 8th century) and remains outside orthodoxy in Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant traditions.\n   - It preserves monotheism superficially (one God, Jesus as exalted man) but destroys the Trinity and atonement: If Jesus isn't fully God, his death can't atone for infinite sin (Anselm's *Cur Deus Homo*), and worship of him (John 20:28; Revelation 5:12–14) becomes idolatry.\n\n### 4. **Implications for Salvation**\n   - Orthodoxy holds salvation requires a divine Savior (Romans 5:19; 2 Corinthians 5:21). Adoptionism makes Jesus a moral exemplar or prophet like Muhammad or Buddha, not the God-man who redeems.\n\nIn summary, this is not a minor disagreement but a fundamental heresy that unravels the gospel, as defined by the undivided church. For deeper reading: Athanasius' *On the Incarnation* or the *Catechism of the Catholic Church* §§464–469.",

It accurately teaches Jesus’ eternal divinity as the eternal Son of God, his incarnation, and the significance of the baptism event as a revelation of identity rather than a moment of ontological change. It cites foundational scriptures (John 1:1, Colossians 2:9, Hebrews 1:3, Philippians 2:6–11, John 8:58) and relevant passages about the virgin birth (Luke 1:35) and the baptismal declaration (Matthew 3:17). It also correctly notes historical condemnations of Adoptionism (e.g., Paul of Samosata, Theodotus, Elipandus) and explains implications for the Trinity and atonement. The response includes important doctrinal distinctions (eternal generation, hypostatic union) and the practical implications for salvation and worship. Minor potential enhancements could include an explicit statement of the Chalcedonian definition (hypostatic union) for even clearer nuance, but the core accuracy is solid and the rationale coherent."
