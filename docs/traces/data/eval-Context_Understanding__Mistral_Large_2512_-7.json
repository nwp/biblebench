          "rationale": "The response aligns well with biblical teaching. It correctly notes that parables serve to reveal truth to those receptive (Matt 13:10–12) and to conceal truth from those who reject or are hardened in unbelief (Mark 4:11–12), that they illustrate spiritual truths in relatable, memorable ways (Matt 13:34–35), and that Jesus’ use of parables fulfills prophecy (Psalm 78:2; Matt 13:35). These points reflect orthodox interpretation and are biblically grounded. Nuance is present in distinguishing between insiders and outsiders and in citing fulfillment of prophecy. A minor gap is that it does not mention the linked practice of privately explaining parables to the disciples after teaching in parables, which adds depth to understanding how parables function in discipleship; this is not an inaccuracy, just an area for fuller nuance. Overall, the answer is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded."
