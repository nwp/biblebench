It cites key biblical texts for the traditional view while explaining an affirming hermeneutic (contextualization within ancient culture). It foregrounds common ground (love, welcome, humility) and offers pastoral guidance that seeks balance rather than doctrinal abolition or radical revision. The framing is pastoral and dialogical rather than polemical, signaling a willingness to acknowledge legitimate diversity of views and to avoid political reductionism. This indicates a moderate stance that respects traditional boundaries while recognizing an affirming minority position as a legitimate minority view.",
