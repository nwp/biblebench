          "rationale": "The response presents a biblically faithful and historically orthodox summary of the gospel. It articulates the problem (sin, guilt, spiritual death), the core proclamation (Christ died for our sins, was buried, and rose again), the proper response (repentance and faith), and the results (justification, reconciliation, adoption, eternal life) by grace through faith in Christ alone. It references key Scriptures (e.g., 1 Cor 15:3-4; Rom 3:23; Eph 2:1; Rom 6:23; John 1:14; Col 2:15; Mark 1:15; Acts 20:21; Eph 2:8-9; Rom 5:1) and correctly treats the gospel as both event and announcement. Minor caveats: the life of Christ is not explicitly stated as a “perfect life” in explicit terms, though it is implied by incarnation and the atoning work; substitutionary atonement is indicated by “Christ died for our sins” but not phrased with that exact term. These are minor refinements, not doctrinal errors. Overall, it aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy and sound biblical grounding."

          "explanation": "The response articulates a classic orthodox gospel: humanity's sin and need for forgiveness; Christ's death, burial, and resurrection; repentance and faith; justification by grace through faith in Christ; and the resulting adoption and eternal life. It rejects common heresies (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism) and does not undermine the Trinity or Christ's full divinity/humanity. The only potential ambiguity is a brief lack of explicit ontological detail about the mechanism of atonement (e.g., penal substitution), but the phrases 'died for our sins' and 'atoning death' are conventional language compatible with classic substitutionary atonement. Overall, no heretical teaching is present."
