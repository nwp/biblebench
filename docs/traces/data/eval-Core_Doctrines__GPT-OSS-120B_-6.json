    "expected": "The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became human, lived a perfect life, died on the cross as a substitute for sinners, rose from the dead, and now offers salvation and reconciliation with God to all who repent and believe in him. It proclaims that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, not earned by human effort, received through faith in Christ alone.",
    "output": "## The Gospel — A Systematic, Biblically Grounded Definition  \n\n**The gospel (Greek *εὐαγγέλιον*, “good news”) is the divine announcement that God has accomplished, in and through the person of Jesus Christ, everything necessary for humanity’s redemption and restoration.**  \n\nIt is the message that:\n\n1. **God is holy, just, and loving.**  \n2. **Human beings are sinners who deserve God’s wrath.**  \n3. **God, in mercy, has provided a perfect, substitutionary sacrifice—Jesus Christ—whose death satisfies divine justice and whose resurrection conquers death.**  \n4. **By trusting in Christ’s person and work, a person is forgiven, declared righteous, given new life, and incorporated into the covenant community of God.**  \n5. **This salvation is a gift of grace, received through faith, and it ushers the believer into a life of obedience, sanctification, and ultimate glorification.**  \n\nBelow is a systematic exposition of the gospel, organized around its essential biblical components.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Content of the Gospel (What It Declares)\n\n| Gospel Component | Biblical Basis | Theological Significance |\n|------------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| **God’s Initiative & Sovereignty** | *John 3:16*; *Eph 2:8‑9*; *Rom 9:15‑16* | Salvation originates from God’s free grace, not from human merit. |\n| **Human Sin & Need** | *Rom 3:23*; *Rom 6:23*; *Ps 14:3* | Universal guilt separates humanity from God; the penalty is death. |\n| **Christ’s Person (Fully God & Fully Man)** | *Joh 1:1‑14*; *Col 2:9*; *Phil 2:6‑8* | Only a divine‑human Savior can bear the infinite worth of God’s honor and the infinite weight of human sin. |\n| **Christ’s Substitutionary Death** | *Rom 3:25*; *1 Pet 2:24*; *Heb 9:28* | Jesus dies “for our sins” and “as a sacrifice of atonement,” satisfying God’s justice. |\n| **Christ’s Resurrection & Lordship** | *1 Cor 15:3‑4*; *Rom 1:4*; *Phil 2:9‑11* | The empty tomb confirms that sin’s penalty has been conquered; Christ is exalted as Lord. |\n| **Justification by Faith** | *Rom 5:1*; *Gal 2:16*; *Eph 2:8‑9* | Believers are declared righteous because Christ’s righteousness is imputed to them. |\n| **Adoption & New Birth** | *Rom 8:15‑17*; *John 1:12‑13*; *2 Cor 5:17* | The gospel brings believers into God’s family and gives them a regenerated heart. |\n| **Sanctification & Holy Living** | *1 Pet 2:24*; *2 Cor 5:21*; *Rom 6:4* | The Spirit applies Christ’s life to the believer, producing moral transformation. |\n| **Future Consummation (Glorification)** | *1 Cor 15:51‑52*; *1 Thess 4:16‑17*; *Rev 21‑22* | The gospel points forward to the final resurrection and the full revelation of God’s kingdom. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Gospel in the New Testament Narrative\n\n### 2.1. The “Good News” Summarized (1 Cor 15:1‑4)\n\n> “Now I would remind you, **the gospel that I proclaimed** to you, **the gospel which you received**, in which **you stand**; by which **you are saved**, if you hold firmly to the **message which I taught you**, unless you believe that you have **been saved** by God’s **grace**.”\n\n*Form*: Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection; **exegesis**: the core historic events that constitute the gospel’s factual basis.\n\n### 2.2. Paul’s Theological Formulation (Romans 1:16‑17)\n\n> “For I am **not ashamed** of the gospel, for it is **the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes**... The righteous shall live by **faith**.”\n\n*Key points*: the gospel is **power** (the means by which God accomplishes salvation) and is **for all** (universal scope).\n\n### 2.3. The Gospel as Covenant Fulfillment (Hebrews 1:1‑2)\n\n> “God, after speaking **through the prophets**, has at last spoken **through his Son**. He **appointed** the Son **over all creation**, making him the **ultimate revelation** of God’s will.”\n\n- The gospel fulfills the Old Testament promises (the Davidic, Abrahamic, and Messianic covenants).\n\n### 2.4. The Gospel’s Ethical Implication (Eph 2:8‑10)\n\n> “For by **grace** you have been **saved** through **faith**, and this is **not from yourselves**; **it is a gift** of God. … we are **his workmanship**, created for **good works**.”\n\n- Salvation is a gift; the response is **good works** empowered by grace.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theological Themes Embedded in the Gospel\n\n### 3.1. **Grace** (πίστις + χάρις)\n\n- **Unmerited favor**; the **universal offering** (Eph 2:8‑9).  \n- Contrasts with works‑based righteousness (cf. *James 2:24*).\n\n### 3.2. **Faith** (πίστις)\n\n- **Trustful reliance** on Christ’s person and work (Rom 3:22; Gal 2:16).  \n- The **instrument** by which grace is appropriated.\n\n### 3.3. **Justification** (δικαίωσις)\n\n- **Legal declaration** of righteousness (Rom 5:1).  \n- **Imputed** Christ’s righteousness to believers (2 Cor 5:21).\n\n### 3.4. **Redemptive History (Chronology)**\n\n1. **Creation good → fall** (Rom 5:12).  \n2. **Covenant promises** (Abraham, Moses, David).  \n3. **Christ’s incarnation** (John 1:14).  \n4. **Atoning death** (Heb 9:22).  \n5. **Resurrection** (1 Cor 15:20‑22).  \n6. **Church age** (Acts 2).  \n7. **Consummation** (Rev 21‑22).\n\n### 3.8. **Kingdom of God**\n\n- The gospel inaugurates the **already‑but‑not‑yet** reign of God (Matt 28:18‑20; Mk 1:15).\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Gospel’s Practical Outworking\n\n| Aspect | Biblical Mandate | Typical Application |\n|--------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| **Proclamation** | *Matt 28:19‑20*; *Rom 10:14‑15* | Evangelism, preaching, discipleship |\n| **Faith Formation** | *Heb 12:2*; *Jas 1:6* | Teaching, catechesis, spiritual disciplines |\n| **Community Life** | *Acts 2:42‑47*; *Eph 4:1‑6* | Fellowship, sacraments, mutual accountability |\n| **Mission** | *2 Cor 5:18‑20*; *Phil 2:5‑11* | Social justice, cultural engagement, global missions |\n| **Hope & Eschatology** | *1 Thess 4:13‑18*; *Rev 21:1‑4* | Comfort, perseverance, worship of the future kingdom |\n\n---\n\n## 5. A Concise, Scripture‑Based Definition (for Teaching)\n\n> **The gospel is the good news that God, out of love, has provided a perfect atonement in Jesus Christ—His death satisfied divine justice, His resurrection defeated death, and through faith believers are forgiven, declared righteous, regenerated, and adopted into God’s family; they receive the Holy Spirit to live now in obedience and look forward to the future consummation of God’s kingdom.**  \n\n*Key verses supporting this definition*:  \n- **John 3:16** – God’s love and the provision of Christ.  \n- **1 Cor 15:3‑4** – The core historical events (death, burial, resurrection).  \n- **Eph 2:8‑9** – Salvation by grace through faith.  \n- **Rom 5:1‑2** – Justification and new life in the Holy Spirit.  \n- **2 Cor 5:17** – The new creation in Christ.  \n- **Phil 2:9‑11** – Christ’s exaltation as Lord of all.  \n- **Rev 21‑22** – The ultimate fulfillment of the gospel in the new heavens and earth.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Why the Gospel Matters Theologically\n\n1. **Christocentrism** – All of Scripture points to Christ; the gospel is *the lens* through which Scripture is interpreted.  \n2. **Soteriology** – It articulates the doctrine of salvation, the heart of Christian belief.  \n3. **Ecclesiology** – The gospel is the basis of the church’s identity, mission, and sacraments.  \n4. **Eschatology** – The gospel’s future hope shapes present ethics and worship.  \n5. **Apologetics** – A clear biblical gospel equips believers to answer the “why?” of faith.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Frequently Asked Clarifications\n\n| Question | Short Answer |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Is the gospel only about “being saved from sin”?** | No. It also includes **being saved for** new life in God, participation in the kingdom, and ultimate redemption of all creation (Rom 8:18‑23). |\n| **Does the gospel require moral perfection?** | No. The gospel declares **righteousness apart from works** (Rom 3:22‑24); it *creates* righteousness in the believer (2 Cor 5:21). |\n| **Can one believe the gospel without being baptized?** | Baptism is the biblical **sign and seal** of the gospel (Matt 28:19; Acts 2:38) but **faith** is the means of salvation (Eph 2:8). |\n| **How does the gospel differ from “religion” or “philosophy”?** | The gospel is **historical, divine, and salvific**; it proclaims a specific person—Jesus Christ—whose life, death, and resurrection *effectually* accomplish what human philosophy or religiosity cannot. |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Concluding Reflection\n\nThe gospel is **the hinge on which all of Christian doctrine turns**. It is the *theological center* (cf. *Acts 20:24*—“my life is not my own, but the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ”) and the *spiritual heartbeat* of every believer. Understanding the gospel **faithfully**—as God’s self‑revelation in Christ, as recorded in Scripture, and as lived out in the world—ensures that our theology remains **Christ‑centered, Scripture‑grounded, and mission‑oriented**.",

          "heresies_detected": [],
          "explanation": "Overall, the response presents a robust and orthodox evangelical definition of the gospel. It affirms the core doctrines: the deity and humanity of Christ, substitutionary atonement, resurrection, justification by grace through faith (including imputed righteousness), adoption, regeneration, sanctification, and future glorification. It traces the NT gospel narrative (1 Cor 15, Romans, Hebrews, Ephesians) and key theological themes (grace, faith, justification, redemptive history, Kingdom of God) and outlines practical outworking in proclamation, formation, community, mission, and eschatology. No explicit errors from classic heresies (Arianism, Modalism, Pelagianism, Gnosticism, Docetism, etc.) are present. Potential considerations (not heresies) include: 1) a strong Reformed emphasis on imputed righteousness and salvation by faith apart from works, which some traditions would express with different nuances about grace, cooperation, and merit; 2) the phrase “universal offering” could be misunderstood if read as universal salvation, though the surrounding emphasis on faith mitigates this; 3) explicit Trinitarian language is present but not foregrounded as a separate doctrinal point; 4) minor editorial quirks ( numbering gaps, a paraphrase of Acts 20:24, and consistency in phrasing) do not undermine the core doctrine. In sum, no substantial heresy is detected; if anything, the content is doctrinally solid within a evangelical/Reformed framework."
