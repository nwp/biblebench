I’ll try to keep the discussion quick, one‑page, and use the same language as the Bible itself – no jargon, just biblical references that you can look up.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The Old‑Testament Law in the Bible\n\n**Jesus’ Declaration (Matthew 5:17‑20)**  \n> “I did **not** come to **abolish** the Law or the Prophets, but to **fulfill** them.”  \n> “The **print** of the Law will not fully disappear until heaven and earth pass away … a single **letter** or **stroke** will fail to bring about judgment.\"\n\nJesus tells us the *appearance* of the Law is still in force, but that the *purpose* of the Law is finished in Him.  \n\n**Paul’s Argument (Romans 10:4)**  \n> “Christ is the **fulfillment (ful‑lending)** of the Law.”  \n\nPaul uses “ful‑lending” (Greek *συμπληρώνω*, “to complete, fill in”) to say the Law’s inability to save comes to an end in Christ.  \n\n**The Three “Kinds” of Law**  \nThe Protestant tradition (especially covenant theology) breaks the law into three parts.  Note how each is treated in the New Testament:\n\n| Type | Text | New‑covenant view |\n|------|------|-------------------|\n| **Civil** (punishment of sin) | *Exodus 21‑23, Deut 17‑21* | Not always binding on Christians, unless it’s also seen as a *philosophical* pre‑Law principle.  In *Romans 13*, Paul says we must obey civil authorities: “**laws** that require that a man keep his salary from his wages…” |\n| **Ceremonial** (ritual, sacrifices, festivals) | *Leviticus, Numbers* | Greek ἀπόσπασμα (“cleaving off”) vs. *Hebrews 10‑12*166 | The Church no longer sacrifices animals.  Jesus’ One‑Sacrifice *John 4:25‑26* “tires the *cleaver* from the tablets.” |\n| **Moral** (rules for righteous living) | *Exodus 20:* Ten Commandments; all “laws of God” *punctuated by \"the Lord, the Lord…*\" | Many Christians still find the moral law a perpetual standard but see it expressed by the *law of love* (Romans 13:8‑10). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Old‑Testament Law in Christian Traditions\n\n| Tradition | Core View on the Old‑Testament Law | Practical Implications |\n|-----------|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Catholic & Eastern Orthodox** | - The **moral law** remains, though it is “transposed onto the New Covenant” – e.g., *Romans 14* & *1 Peter 4* show we should live by Christian conscience. – The **law has never been abolished**; it is “**fulfilled**” in that Christ *perfected* the human heart (Heb. 8:13). | Catholics keep a “partial obedience” to the law: 1) **Moral** (liberally protecting life, human dignity, the Ten Commandments) ; 2) **Liturgical** (e.g., fasting‑good‑fare‑fast). |\n| **Protestant Evangelical** | - **Full fulfillment** of the Old‑Testament law by Christ. – Only the *moral core* is implicitly binding. | Evangelicals emphasize “**Romans 6**” and “**Ephesians 2**”: we *are no longer servants of sin*; our *new obedience* is towards the *new covenant* (the law of love). |\n| **Mainline Protestant** | - A **gradual transition**: Jewish faith continues the Old‑Testament law, the Church enjoys the *covenanted state*. | Christians are encouraged to “**operate**” under the law of love, not by “sinly *keep*.” |\n| **Seventh‑Day Adventist** | - The **pleasurable** version of the law (moral code) remains because it “shows freedom before God.” | Adventists observe the **Sabbath** and other health‑law items (pursuing a lifestyle that reflects the *coded heart*). |\n| **Liberal/Reform/New Testament‑Centric** | - The *law* is a *historical artifact* that underscores the nature of God but is **not** a moral requirement.  *Paul’s argument* + *James* shows the created moral law was replaced by “informed liberty.” | “An ethical science” basis: just “psychology + the Holy Spirit” shapes Christians. |\n\nAcross the board, most Christians agree that the **ceremonial law** – sacrifices, animal offerings, many dietary rules – is *not* binding.  Likewise, the *civil law* that the Romans thought tied biblical law to the *state* is *no longer a law* for Christians unless heavily petitioned.\n\nThe moral law is a special gray area:\n\n* **True moral law** – The Ten Commandments and the law in *Matthew 22:37‑38* – “the greatest commandment” – is still authoritative.  \n* **Ancillary moral law** – Laws tied to race‑specific, historical circumstances (e.g., “go to Canaan”) are not.  \n\nA useful rule is: **any law that requires *works* for salvation is false** (Heb. 10:10).\n\n---\n\n## 3.  How to Talk About the Law With Others\n\n### If you’re teaching or studying:\n\n1. **Start with the Old Testament, then the New:**  \n   a. Highlight that the law’s *purpose* is to “conclude paralysis” (*Romans 8:3–4*).  \n   b. Emphasize that Scripture repeatedly shows the law “advising” rather than “enforcing.”  \n\n2. **Use Paul's arguments as the practical pivot:**\n\n   *He is the one *who fulfills the law*, not a *law‑breaker*.*\n\n   > “Christ is the **ful‑lender** and **satisfier** of the Law.” – *Romans 10:4*  \n   > “None harms no one & all are obligated to love one another.” – *Gal. 5:14*  \n\n3. **Address the common confusion**: When people say “Christ *fulfilled* the Law”, it’s not the same as “Christ *abolished* the Law.”  The *physical* aspects (esp. sacrifices) *stop*, but the *spiritual* obligation – obedience out of love – continues.  \n\n---\n\n## 4.  Practical Implications for Church Life\n\n| Topic | Old‑Testament law | New‑Testament positioning | Action |\n|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------|\n| **Sabbath** | Day of rest (Exodus 20:8‑11) | *Ephesians 5:15‑17* & *Hebrews 4:9‑10* – “rest in Christ, not in the law.” | Observe rest *today* as a *spiritual rest* (wake‑up, repentance, service). |\n| **Dietary** | Manna & a strict list (Leviticus 11) | *Acts 10:9‑16* illustrates Peter’s vision of “people of all nations.” | Practice generous hospitality; see food as relevant, not commanded. |\n| **Civil-Political** | “Do not take vengeance” (Exodus 21:12‑19) | *Romans 13* – obey civil authority while refusing any law that demands immorality. | Church should lobby based on Christian ethics, not *legalistic mandates*. |\n| **Ethics: Ten Commandments** | \"Love God and love your neighbour.\" | *John 13:34‑35*: “Love *as* I have loved.” | Pray, teach, and live out the “law in love.” |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  BottomLine For Christians:\n\n1. **Christ has “fulfilled” the entire Mosaic Law** – that is, the *works‑based* demands for salvation are over.  \n2. **Ceremonial & civil laws** tied to the old covenant are **not binding** for Christians today.  \n3. **The moral law** (the “heart of the law”) remains – the Ten Commandments and a basic ethical framework that echoes the *law of love* (`Romans 13:8‑10`).  \n4. **Christ’s “new law”** is the *love command* (loving God, loving one another) – the *law that judges a man by his heart.*\n\n---\n\n### A Few Closing Thoughts\n\n- **Every Christian, regardless of tradition, should start where Scripture places them**: “Obey the law of love, not the ‘old law‑system’ that demanded sacrifices.”  \n- **If you’re trying to keep the heads of the Church in sync**: Speak to the **teachings on the new covenant** and encourage that believers **do not unknowingly mistake** the *law as a self‑saving promise* (major stumbling block).  \n- **Practical life tips**:  \n  - **Lectio Divina**: Encourage reading of Romans 8: The law's *purpose*; check that your daily decisions align with loving empathy *not* ritual compliance.  \n  - **Fasting**: Replace the discipline of physical abstention with *spiritual fasting* (attention to inner transformation).  \n  - **Community service**: Visceral practice of “love in action” rather than “lawful duty.”\n\n---\n\n*I hope this balanced view gives you a clear starting point for your studies or conversations at your church or study group. The primary textual anchor (*Romans 10:4* and *Galatians 3:24–25*) implies that Christians live under Christ’s *“new covenant”* which, in turn, replaces the old Mosaic covenant. The moral, heart‑level instructions are the lighthouses that guide the journey, but they’re illuminated by love, the ultimate law ordained by God.*",

It also includes practical implications and cautions, indicating a willingness to engage diverse perspectives rather than insisting on a single stance. The tone is generally humble and balanced, though it does advance a main bottom-line view (Christ fulfills the Law; moral law remains under the law of love), it situates this within a broader, pluralistic discussion and invites dialogue."
