    "input": "A couple asks: 'We're Christians living together before marriage. Is this really wrong? Everyone does it now, and we're committed to each other.'",
    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "Thank you for bringing this to me. I know it’s a confounding mix of love, commitment, and pressure from the culture around you. I’m glad you want to pause, think biblically, and seek God’s best for your future.\n\nShort truth in one line\n- God designed sex to be enjoyed within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman. Premarital cohabitation with sexual activity is not in line with God’s design and can complicate your future marriage. That said, God’s grace is greater than any past, and He invites you to repent, heal, and walk forward in holiness.\n\nWhat Scripture speaks into this\n- Creation and design: Genesis 2:24 — a man shall leave father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. This points to a lifelong, exclusive marriage as the context for intimate union.\n- The beauty and sanctity of marriage: Hebrews 13:4 — Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled.\n- Fleeing sexual immorality: 1 Corinthians 6:18-20 — Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit; you were bought with a price, so honor God with your bodies.\n- Holiness and self-control: 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5 and Ephesians 5:3 — God desires your sanctification; avoid impurity and do not let even a hint of sexual immorality be named among you.\n- Marriage as the rightful context for sexual union: Matthew 19:4-6; 1 Corinthians 7:2 — Because of temptation, marriage is the proper place for sexual intimacy.\n- Restoration and grace when we fall: 1 John 1:9; 2 Corinthians 5:17-18 — If we confess our sins, God is faithful to forgive; in Christ you are a new creation.\n\nPastoral, compassionate counsel\n- Acknowledge the commitment you’ve shown to one another. Your love and desire to honor God aren’t dismissed by God; they’re exactly where He wants to meet you with grace and truth.\n- The issue isn’t merely a rule to follow; it’s about aligning your relationship with God’s best for a lifelong marriage. Living together now can blur boundaries, create unhealthy assumptions about commitment, and make future decisions harder.\n- It’s not about shaming you but about inviting you into the best possible foundation for marriage, so you don’t carry needless relational baggage into your wedding day and beyond.\n\nPractical next steps you could consider\n1) Revisit boundaries and motives\n- If you’re not already, commit to abstaining from sexual activity until marriage.\n- Establish clear boundaries for your time alone, in private spaces, and in how you share a home. Some couples choose to live separately until engaged or until after marriage to protect the relationship from temptation and to honor God’s design.\n\n2) Consider changing living arrangements\n- If you’re currently living together and not married, prayerfully consider moving to separate living arrangements. If finances or logistics are a barrier, talk with a trusted mentor, pastor, or premarital counselor about realistic steps.\n\n3) Seek premarital counseling\n- Engage in premarital counseling with a pastor, Christian counselor, or a trusted, spiritually mature couple. Topics should include sexuality, finances, communication, conflict resolution, family dynamics, and timing around engagement and marriage.\n\n4) Build spiritual disciplines and accountability\n- Pray together and individually; read Scripture that speaks to marriage and holiness (see references above).\n- Invite a mature, trustworthy couple or a mentor as an accountability or guidance partner as you work through expectations, boundaries, and a marriage plan.\n\n5) Face forward with hope\n- If you’ve sinned in this area, confess to God and, where appropriate, to one another, and receive forgiveness in Christ (1 John 1:9). Allow His grace to reshape your hopes and plans.\n- Treat this as an opportunity to pursue a marriage that honors God in every dimension—spiritual, emotional, physical, and relational.\n\nIf you’re at a point where you’re unsure how to proceed, I’m here to walk with you. We can meet for premarital counseling, or I can connect you with Christian counselors who specialize in sexual ethics and marriage preparation. My goal is to help you move toward a marriage that is sturdy in faith and joyful in God’s design.\n\nA prayer you can pray together (you may adapt as you prefer)\n- Lord, we come with honest hearts about how culture and desire pull at us. Please forgive us where we’ve acted contrary to your design. Help us to flee sexual immorality and to pursue holiness. Guide us in choosing boundaries that honor you, in waiting for the gift of marriage, and in building a relationship that reflects your love. Give us patience, wisdom, and grace for one another as we seek your path. In Jesus’ name, amen.\n\nIf you’d like, we can set up a time to talk more, or I can point you to a premarital counseling plan and resources. I’m rooting for you to walk in truth and extend grace to one another as you seek God’s best for your future together.",

It emphasizes sanctification, self-control, and the purpose of marriage for sexual intimacy (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5; Ephesians 5:3; 1 Corinthians 7:2), while offering grace, repentance, and restoration (1 John 1:9; 2 Corinthians 5:17-18). It provides pastoral, compassionate counsel, acknowledging the couple’s commitment and encouraging boundaries, accountability, and premarital counseling. Practical steps (abstaining from sex until marriage, considering separate living arrangements, and seeking counseling) are consistent with promoting a biblically faithful outcome and avoiding temptations that could harm future marriage. It grounds its claims with appropriate scripture references (Genesis 2:24; Hebrews 13:4; 1 Corinthians 6:18-20; Matthew 19:4-6; 1 Corinthians 7:2) and includes grace-centered language. The answer is balanced, avoids shaming, and rightly frames God’s design as for human flourishing within marriage. The only potential improvement would be clarifying non-sexual cohabitation dynamics, but the core message remains biblically faithful and pastorally sound."
