    "expected": "Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both biblical truths held in tension. God is completely sovereign over all things, yet humans are genuine moral agents responsible for their choices. Scripture teaches both that God ordains all things and that humans make real choices for which they are accountable. Different theological traditions emphasize these aspects differently (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), but orthodox Christianity affirms both truths without fully resolving the mystery of how they relate.",
    "output": "**Divine Sovereignty & Human Responsibility: A Biblical and Systematic Overview**  \n\nBelow is a concise, biblically‑grounded exposition of how the Christian tradition has understood the coexistence of God’s absolute rule (sovereignty) and the genuine accountability of human beings (responsibility).  The presentation proceeds in four parts:\n\n1. **Definitions**  \n2. **Scriptural Foundations**  \n3. **Theological Frameworks**  \n4. **Practical Implications**  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Definitions\n\n| Term | Biblical Core Idea | Typical Theological Usage |\n|------|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Divine Sovereignty** | God “has the right to do as He wills” (Psalm 115:3; Ephesians 1:11). He ordains, sustains, and directs all of history without being thwarted. | “God is the ultimate cause of everything that happens.” Often expressed with verbs like *ordain*, *predestine*, *decree*, *govern*. |\n| **Human Responsibility** | People are called to *believe*, *repent*, *obey*, and are held accountable before God (Romans 2:6; Matthew 12:36). | “Man is a moral agent who can act rightly or wrongly and will be judged accordingly.” |\n\nThe tension lies in how a God who “does everything according to the counsel of His will” can also hold created beings answerable for their choices.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Scriptural Foundations\n\n### A. Passages Emphasizing Sovereignty\n\n| Passage | Key Idea |\n|--------|----------|\n| **Genesis 1‑2** | God creates ex nihilo and “the heavens and the earth were finished” (v 1). |\n| **Isaiah 45:7** | “I form the light and create darkness… I am the LORD; there is no other.” |\n| **Ephesians 1:11** | God “works all things according to the counsel of His will.” |\n| **Romans 9:15‑21** | “I will have mercy on whomever I have mercy… the potter has the right to make of one lump of clay…” |\n| **Acts 17:26** | God “determined the times and the places in which they should live.” |\n\n### B. Passages Emphasizing Responsibility\n\n| Passage | Key Idea |\n|--------|----------|\n| **Deuteronomy 30:19‑20** | “Choose life… to love the LORD your God, to obey his voice…” |\n| **John 3:16‑19** | “Whoever believes in Him shall not perish…” and “the one who does evil hates the light.” |\n| **Matthew 23:37** | Jesus laments, “How often would I have gathered you… but you were not willing.” |\n| **Romans 2:6** | “God will render to each one according to his deeds.” |\n| **2 Peter 3:9** | God “is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.” |\n\n### C. Passages That Hold Both Truths Simultaneously\n\n| Passage | How Both Themes Appear |\n|--------|------------------------|\n| **John 6:44** – “No one can come to Me unless the Father who sends Me draws him.” (Sovereignty of grace) **but** “I have come down from heaven … that whoever believes in Me shall not perish.” (Human response required). |\n| **Philippians 2:12‑13** – “Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you both to will and to act.” (Divine enablement + human effort). |\n| **Acts 2:23** – “He was delivered up… according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God.” (God’s plan) **yet** “He was crucified by the hands of lawless men.” (human agency). |\n| **1 Peter 1:1‑2** – “Chosen… according to the foreknowledge of God the Father… to obey Him.” (Election + obedience). |\n\nThese “both/and” texts are the biblical proof‑texts that any systematic account must honor.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theological Frameworks\n\nBelow are the major Christ‑centered approaches that have tried to keep the tension biblical and logical.  I present each with its **key biblical anchors**, **logical structure**, and **common criticisms**.  The goal is not to champion one system over another, but to show the breadth of orthodox thought.\n\n### 3.1. Classical Reformed (Calvinist) View\n\n| Element | Statement | Biblical Support |\n|---------|------------|-------------------|\n| **Unconditional Election** | God chose some people to be saved before the foundation of the world, not based on foreseen merit. | Romans 9:11‑13; Ephesians 1:4‑5 |\n| **Irresistible Grace** | When God extends saving grace to the elect, it inevitably results in a willing response. | John 6:44; Romans 8:30 |\n| **Sovereign Determinism** | God ordains all events, including the decisions of created agents; human will is bound to the divine decree. | Isaiah 46:10; Acts 17:26 |\n| **Human Responsibility** | People still act according to their *perceived* motives; the Bible commands them to repent and believe. | Matthew 7:21; 2 Timothy 2:25 |\n| **Logical Formula** | **God’s decree → God’s providential ordering → human actions (as they appear)**. The agents are *real*, but their freedom is understood as “compatibly free” (they act according to their desires, which God has sovereignly shaped). | – |\n\n**Strengths**: Preserves the biblical teaching that God is fully in control of salvation and all history; offers a high view of God’s glory.  \n**Weaknesses (as raised by critics)**: Appears to make human will merely an illusion; challenges intuition about moral responsibility.\n\n### 3.2. Classical Arminian (Molinist) View\n\n| Element | Statement | Biblical Support |\n|---------|------------|-------------------|\n| **Conditional Election** | God elects those whom He foreknows will freely respond in faith. | 1 Peter 1:2 (foreknowledge); Romans 8:29 (conformed to Christ in accordance with foreknowledge). |\n| **Sufficient Grace + Resistible Grace** | The Holy Spirit provides the ability to believe, but the individual may reject it. | John 12:32 (“If a man loves Me, he will keep My word”); Acts 7:51 (“You have hardened your hearts”). |\n| **Middle Knowledge (Molinism)** | God knows what any free creature would freely do in any possible circumstance (His *scientia media*) and thus can sovereignly order the world without violating freedom. | 1 Cor 10:13 (God provides a way to endure temptation); Psalm 139:4 (God knows our ways). |\n| **Human Freedom** | People are genuinely free to accept or reject God’s call. | Deuteronomy 30:19 (“Choose life”) ; Revelation 22:17 (“If anyone is thirsty, let him come”). |\n| **Logical Formula** | **God’s sovereign plan + middle knowledge → God arranges circumstances → free human choices**. Human decisions are *real* and effective, and God’s providence incorporates those choices. | – |\n\n**Strengths**: Preserves strong moral responsibility; accounts for the biblical call to repentance.  \n**Weaknesses**: The concept of *middle knowledge* is philosophically complex and not explicit in Scripture; critics argue it can imply that God’s will is contingent on human choices.\n\n### 3.3. Open‑Theism (A Minority Position)\n\n| Element | Statement | Biblical Support |\n|---------|------------|-------------------|\n| **God knows all that is logically possible**, but the future free actions of persons are *not* exhaustively known until they occur. | Jeremiah 33:3 (“Ask… and it shall be given to you”) ; 1 Samuel 3:10 (God calls Samuel “who?”). |\n| **Divine Sovereignty** is understood as God’s dynamic, relational governance rather than exhaustive pre‑determination. | Genesis 22:12 (“Now I know that you fear God”) – God’s response to Abraham’s free obedience. |\n| **Human Freedom** is libertarian; individuals can choose otherwise than God “intends.” | Matthew 26:39 (“Yet not as I will, but as you will”) – Jesus submits to a genuine divine will that is not predetermined. |\n| **Logical Formula** | **God’s present will + foreknowledge of probabilities → God makes real‑time decisions with creation**. | – |\n\n**Strengths**: Emphasizes the genuine openness of the future and upholds God’s relational love.  \n**Weaknesses**: Many Reformed and evangelical scholars argue it diminishes God’s absolute control and undermines biblical passages that speak of God’s definite purpose (cf. Romans 9, Ephesians 1:11).\n\n### 3.4. Compatibilist Synthesis (Common in Reformed Orthodoxy)\n\nA **compatibilist** understands *freedom* as “the ability to act according to one’s desires,” while also affirming that those desires are themselves the product of God’s sovereign work.  \n\n- **Biblical Basis**: Philippians 2:12‑13; 1 Corinthians 7:24 (“each person should lead the life that the Lord has assigned”).  \n- **Logical Structure**:  \n  1. **Decree** – God ordains a plan of salvation.  \n  2. **Effectual Calling** – The Holy Spirit changes the heart, producing the desire to believe.  \n  3. **Free-Choice Action** – The person, moved by this desire, willingly says “yes.”  \nThus, the person is **responsible** because the action flows from his (or her) own volition, even though that volition is ultimately a **gift** of God’s grace.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical Implications for Faith & Life\n\n| Area | How the Doctrine Shapes Practice |\n|------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Assurance of Salvation** | Believers can trust that nothing can thwart God’s saving purposes (cf. Romans 8:30) while also recognizing that personal perseverance is required (Hebrews 10:26‑31). |\n| **Evangelism & Missions** | Since God’s sovereign call is effective (Reformed) *or* God graciously enables a genuine response (Arminian), Christians are commanded to proclaim the gospel **regardless** of the outcome (Matt 28:19‑20; 1 Cor 9:22). |\n| **Prayer** | Prayer is both **instrumental** (God’s will is accomplished through our petition) and **participatory** (our petitions can influence God’s actions with respect to contingent events) (Phil 4:6‑7; James 5:16). |\n| **Ethical Living** | responsibility demands moral obedience (Romans 6:1‑2). The doctrine of sovereignty prevents fatalism: while God ordains, He also commands us to “work out your salvation” (Phil 2:12). |\n| **Suffering & Trials** | Believers can rest in God’s ultimate control (and goodness) while also seeking to understand the *temporal* reasons for suffering (e.g., discipline, sanctification, or corporate judgment – see Job, Romans 5:3‑5). |\n| **Church Unity** | Recognizing that sincere, biblically rooted convictions exist on both sides of the sovereignty‑responsibility spectrum can foster gracious dialogue rather than division. The essential creed is: **God is sovereign, and humans are responsible** (see the historic Anglican *Four Points of Unity*; the Reformed *Westminster Confession*; the Wesleyan *Articles of Religion*). |\n\n---\n\n### A Concise Theological Summary\n\n> **Divine sovereignty** affirms that God, in His eternal purpose and providence, ordains the overall pattern of history—including the plan of salvation. **Human responsibility** affirms that individuals, as persons created in the image, are called to make real choices—believing, obeying, repenting—and will be judged according to those choices. The biblical witness presents both truths simultaneously (cf. Philippians 2:12‑13). Theologically, the tension is resolved by affirming that **God’s sovereign will and human free agency are not mutually exclusive**; rather, they operate on different dimensions of reality—God’s *eternal decree* versus humanity’s *temporal decision*. Whether one emphasizes the unconditional nature of God's election (Reformed), the conditional nature of election based on foreknowledge (Arminian/Molinist), or a dynamic openness (Open‑theism), every orthodox confession maintains that **God’s glory and human accountability are both taught in Scripture and must be upheld together**.\n\n---\n\n#### Suggested Further Reading\n\n| Tradition | Key Works |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Reformed | *Institutes of the Christian Religion* (John Calvin); *The Westminster Confession of Faith* (Chapter III). |\n| Arminian/Molinist | *The Freedom of the Will* (J. C. Covenant); *Molinism* (Luis de Molina, *Concordia*; modern: William Lane Craig, *The God Who Controls Everything*). |\n| Open‑Theism | *The Openness of God* (Clark Pinnock et al.). |\n| General Systematics | *Systematic Theology* (Wayne Grudem, §§ 3‑6); *Christian Theology* (Alister McGrath, Chap. 7). |\n\nMay this exposition aid your study, preaching, and personal reflection on the profound mystery of a sovereign God who lovingly holds each of us accountable.

          "explanation": "The response is broadly orthodox in its treatment of divine sovereignty and human responsibility, presenting a range of historic positions (Calvinist, Arminian/Molinist, compatibilist). However, it includes a dedicated section on Open-Theism as a minority position. Open-Theism posits that God does not exhaustively know future free actions until they occur, which conflicts with classical Christian orthodoxy on divine omniscience and immutability (e.g., Isaiah 46:10; Romans 9; Ephesians 1:11). Within historic creeds and longer-standing systematic theologies, this view is generally considered heterodox. This single element constitutes the primary deviation from orthodox teaching. Other parts of the piece accurately reflect common tensions and the mainstream reconciliation of sovereignty and responsibility, though some formulations (e.g., “middle knowledge”) are disputed interpretations. Recommendations: if aiming for broad orthodoxy, either omit Open-Theism or clearly present it as a controversial minority view with robust caveats and engagement with opposing scriptural interpretations. } } }要把这段输出保留成JSON格式，注意不要多余的文本。"

Whether one emphasizes the unconditional nature of God's election (Reformed), the conditional nature of election based on foreknowledge (Arminian/Molinist), or a dynamic openness (Open‑theism), every orthodox confession maintains that **God’s glory and human accountability are both taught in Scripture and must be upheld together**.\n\n---\n\n#### Suggested Further Reading\n\n| Tradition | Key Works |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Reformed | *Institutes of the Christian Religion* (John Calvin); *The Westminster Confession of Faith* (Chapter III). |\n| Arminian/Molinist | *The Freedom of the Will* (J. C. Covenant); *Molinism* (Luis de Molina, *Concordia*; modern: William Lane Craig, *The God Who Controls Everything*). |\n| Open‑Theism | *The Openness of God* (Clark Pinnock et al.). |\n| General Systematics | *Systematic Theology* (Wayne Grudem, §§ 3‑6); *Christian Theology* (Alister McGrath, Chap. 7). |\n\nMay this exposition aid your study, preaching, and personal reflection on the profound mystery of a sovereign God who lovingly holds each of us accountable.
