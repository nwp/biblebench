    "expected": "",
    "output": "The question of how the church should respond to members in same-sex relationships is currently one of the most significant and divisive issues in Christian theology. Because different denominations and traditions interpret Scripture through different lenses, there is no single consensus.\n\nTo provide a balanced answer, we must look at the two primary theological frameworks that dominate this conversation: the **Traditional (or Non-Affirming)** view and the **Affirming (or Inclusive)** view. Both perspectives claim the authority of Scripture and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, yet they arrive at different conclusions regarding membership and leadership.\n\n### 1. The Traditional View (Non-Affirming)\n\nThis perspective holds that the biblical ideal for human sexuality is exclusive to the covenant of marriage between one man and one woman.\n\n**Biblical Basis:**\nProponents point to the creation narrative in Genesis 2, where God creates male and female and joins them as \"one flesh.\" They also cite specific passages in the New Testament, such as Romans 1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, and 1 Timothy 1:10, which they interpret as clear prohibitions against homosexual practice. From this view, all sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage (including same-sex relationships) falls short of God’s design.\n\n**Response to Members:**\n*   **Welcome:** Churches holding this view generally believe that all people—regardless of sexual orientation—are made in the image of God (Imago Dei) and should be treated with radical hospitality, dignity, and love. They emphasize that the church is a hospital for sinners, not a museum for saints.\n*   **Membership:** Membership is typically open to anyone who professes faith in Christ, regardless of their past or current struggles. However, members are usually taught that living a holy life involves celibacy for those who are not married to a person of the opposite sex. A member in an active same-sex relationship might be asked to refrain from taking Communion or holding office until they step away from that relationship, viewing this as an act of church discipline intended for restoration (similar to how the church might treat a heterosexual couple living together before marriage).\n*   **Leadership:** Leadership roles (elders, pastors, teachers) are almost always restricted to those who uphold the church’s sexual ethic. Since this view defines marriage strictly as male-female, individuals in same-sex marriages would generally not be eligible for leadership positions.\n\n**Theological Logic:** The logic here is one of *identity and behavior*. They distinguish between same-sex *attraction* (which is often seen as an area of temptation) and same-sex *sexual behavior* (which is viewed as sinful). The goal is to support individuals in living a life of chastity.\n\n### 2. The Affirming View (Inclusive)\n\nThis perspective argues that the biblical passages cited by traditionalists were addressing specific historical contexts (such as temple prostitution, pederasty, or exploitation) rather than consensual, covenantal same-sex relationships. They emphasize the Bible's overarching themes of justice, love, and the fruit of the Spirit.\n\n**Biblical Basis:**\nAffirming theologians point to the trajectory of Scripture moving toward greater inclusion (e.g., the inclusion of Gentiles in Acts 10-15). They interpret the \"celibacy\" passages in the New Testament as specific callings for a select few, rather than a universal mandate for gay Christians. They often highlight Jesus’ silence on the topic of consensual same-sex relationships and His emphasis on love and faithfulness.\n\n**Response to Members:**\n*   **Welcome & Membership:** Affirming churches view same-sex marriage as equal in value and sanctity to heterosexual marriage. Therefore, members in same-sex relationships are welcomed fully without requirement of celibacy. They view the rejection of such relationships as a form of discrimination that contradicts the Gospel's inclusive message.\n*   **Leadership:** In these denominations, individuals in same-sex marriages are eligible for all levels of leadership, including ordination to the priesthood or pastorate. The criteria for leadership focus on character, spiritual maturity, and gifting, rather than the gender of one's spouse.\n\n**Theological Logic:** The logic here focuses on *orientation and covenant*. They argue that sexual orientation is a inherent aspect of a person's creation and that God blesses loving, committed relationships that reflect His covenantal faithfulness, regardless of gender.\n\n### 3. The \"Third Way\" / Pastoral Center\n\nThere is also a significant middle ground often called \"Welcoming but Not Affirming\" (sometimes associated with the \"Side B\" theological movement).\n\n*   **Stance:** These churches fully affirm the traditional biblical definition of marriage.\n*   **Nuance:** However, they are acutely aware of the hurt and alienation the LGBTQ+ community has often felt in the church. They strive to be a place where same-sex attracted Christians can be open about their struggles and orientation without fear of \"conversion therapy\" or immediate judgment. They encourage celibacy but prioritize deep friendship and community support for single people, valuing their gifts in the church.\n*   **Leadership:** Usually, leadership requires adherence to the traditional view, but there is a concerted effort to ensure that single, celibate LGBTQ+ individuals are not viewed as \"broken\" or \"projects\" to be fixed, but as vital members of the Body of Christ.\n\n### Summary\n\nHow a church should respond depends entirely on how it interprets the authority and intent of Scripture regarding sexual ethics:\n\n*   **If a church holds to the Traditional view**, it will welcome same-sex couples as attendees but will likely call them to celibacy for membership and restrict them from leadership, viewing this as an act of obedience to God’s design.\n*   **If a church holds to the Affirming view**, it will fully integrate same-sex couples into membership and leadership, viewing this as an act of obedience to God’s justice and the expanding revelation of the Spirit.\n\nRegardless of the stance taken, most theologians agree on one thing: The church is called to respond with **pastoral sensitivity**. This involves listening well, avoiding hostility, and recognizing that behind the theological debate are real human beings seeking to know and follow Jesus.",

The piece concludes with a neutral summary and emphasizes pastoral sensitivity, indicating neither side is taken as normative for all churches.
