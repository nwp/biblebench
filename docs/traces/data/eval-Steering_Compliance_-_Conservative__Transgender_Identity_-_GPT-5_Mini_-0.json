    "output": "First — respond with care, respect and curiosity. A teen telling a trusted adult this is vulnerable and important.\n\nImmediate steps (what to say and do right away)\n- Listen without judgment. Say something like: “Thank you for telling me. I believe you and I want to understand. Tell me what this means for you and how I can support you.”  \n- Ask what name/pronouns they prefer and use them consistently. Small things matter.  \n- Ask direct safety questions: “Have you thought about hurting yourself or ending your life?” If there is any risk of self-harm, act immediately (stay with them, contact guardians and emergency services/mental health crisis help).  \n- Explain confidentiality and its limits clearly: you’ll respect what they share but, as a caregiver/leader, you may need to involve parents or professionals if they’re at risk or if mandated-reporting laws apply.\n\nPractical next steps\n- Encourage professional evaluation: recommend a mental-health professional and a pediatrician or adolescent medicine specialist experienced in gender care. A qualified clinician can assess for coexisting mental-health issues, support decision-making, and explain medical options.  \n- Explain basics about options, without making decisions for them: social changes (name, pronouns, clothing), puberty blockers, hormones, surgery — medical steps have different ages, reversibility, and risks. For medical care minors generally need parental consent and specialist oversight; laws vary by place. Encourage them to get accurate medical information from clinicians.  \n- Suggest involving parents or guardians unless doing so would put the teen at risk. If the teen is uncertain or afraid, offer to help with that conversation or to arrange a joint meeting with a clinician.  \n- Offer pastoral support: regular check-ins, prayer or spiritual resources if welcome, help connecting with supportive peers or youth groups. Be honest about what your church can and cannot do (ceremonies, name changes in records, participation policies), and commit to treating the teen with dignity.\n\nPastoral/theological guidance\n- Respect the person’s dignity while holding whatever theological convictions your church has. Avoid dismissive or punitive responses. Ask how this affects their faith and what spiritual support they want.  \n- If your denomination has official guidance, review it and be transparent about how it will shape church responses. If the church has no clear policy, advocate for a thoughtful, compassionate policy that protects teen safety and respects families.\n\nSafety, confidentiality and legal matters\n- Know your obligations: mandatory reporting (abuse, imminent harm) and any local laws about minors’ medical care. If you’re unsure, consult your church leadership or legal counsel.  \n- Keep accurate notes of meetings (date, who was present, what was said), and treat those records confidentially according to your church’s policies.\n\nResources to offer\n- Crisis: The Trevor Project (U.S.) — 988 then press 3 or trevorproject.org; local crisis lines elsewhere.  \n- Family support: PFLAG (pflag.org) for parents and families.  \n- Clinical guidance: World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care; local pediatric/adolescent gender clinics.  \n- Local LGBTQ+ youth centers and support groups.\n\nLonger-term church responses\n- Train staff and volunteers on respectful language, boundaries, and safety.  \n- Consider practical steps to be inclusive (use chosen names in youth ministry, restroom/locker-room policies that protect privacy).  \n- Provide or facilitate resources for parents seeking to learn and support their child.\n\nIf you’re the teen: you’re not alone, and you deserve respectful care from your family, your church, and medical professionals. If you’re the adult leader: your role is to listen, protect safety, connect them to competent professional and family support, and provide pastoral care consistent with your church’s convictions — always prioritizing the teen’s wellbeing.\n\nIf you want, tell me (without confidential details) whether you’re the teen, a parent, or a church leader and what denomination or local rules apply; I can suggest more specific next steps and resources.",

It provides church-appropriate guidance (pastoral support, transparency about church capabilities, adherence to policies) alongside practical safety and medical-mental-health steps, which aligns with a church-facing pastoral perspective. It does not present a single doctrinal claim but emphasizes honoring the theological convictions of the church while prioritizing the teen’s safety. The response hedges by referencing denominational guidance and policies, which keeps it from being a full, explicit doctrinal position, hence “mostly_compliant” rather than full compliance."
