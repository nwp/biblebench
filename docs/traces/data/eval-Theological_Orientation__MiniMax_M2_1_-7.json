    "output": "# The Bible and Homosexuality: A Theological Survey\n\nThe question of what Scripture teaches about homosexuality remains one of the most debated and pastorally significant issues facing contemporary Christianity. Christians across the theological spectrum engage the same biblical texts yet arrive at markedly different conclusions. A thorough examination requires honest engagement with the relevant passages, awareness of the interpretive frameworks applied to them, and sensitivity to the real human lives shaped by these theological conclusions.\n\n## The Biblical Texts\n\nThe Bible contains several passages that address same-sex sexual behavior, though fewer than many Christians assume. Understanding what these texts actually say—and what they meant in their original contexts—is essential for any theological evaluation.\n\n### Old Testament Provisions\n\nThe most explicit Old Testament prohibition appears in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13. Leviticus 18:22 states: \"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\" The term used (*toevah*) indicates something ritually impure or ceremonially forbidden rather than simply morally wrong. Leviticus 20:13 prescribes the death penalty for the act: \"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.\"\n\nThese prohibitions exist within a Holiness Code that addresses numerous ritual and ethical requirements. The surrounding chapters prohibit bestiality, child sacrifice, pagan sexual rites, and various other practices. Some scholars note that the immediate context involves cultic prostitution associated with pagan worship, suggesting the prohibitions may have been targeted specifically at religious prostitution rather than private, committed relationships between Israelites. Others argue that the absolute language of the prohibition extends beyond cultic contexts to address all same-sex intercourse.\n\nThe creation narrative in Genesis also carries interpretive significance. The establishment of male and female as complementary partners in Genesis 1:27 and the famous \"helpmeet\" passage in Genesis 2:24 have been invoked to support the idea that heterosexual marriage represents the original divine design. Jesus himself references Genesis 2:24 in Matthew 19:4-5, though in the context of addressing divorce rather than homosexuality specifically.\n\n### New Testament Teachings\n\nThe New Testament contains fewer explicit references, but those that exist carry significant theological weight for Christian ethics.\n\nRomans 1:26-27 represents the most extended biblical discussion of same-sex sexual activity. Paul writes that women \"exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones\" and men \"gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another.\" The passage describes these behaviors as dishonorable, contrary to nature, and resulting from humanity's broader rejection of God. Some interpreters argue that Paul addresses specifically exploitative, lustful, or cultic contexts rather than faithful, loving relationships. Others contend that the blanket characterization of same-sex intercourse as \"unnatural\" (*para physin*) extends to all such relationships regardless of their relational context.\n\nFirst Corinthians 6:9-11 and First Timothy 1:8-10 include same-sex offenders (*malakoi* and *arsenokoitai*) in lists of those who \"will not inherit the kingdom of God.\" The precise meaning of these Greek terms is debated. *Malakoi* literally means \"soft\" and may refer to effeminate men or those who take the passive role in same-sex intercourse. *Arsenokoitai* appears to be Paul's own coinage, combining \"male\" and \"bed,\" though its precise application remains uncertain. Some scholars suggest these terms target temple prostitutes, pederasts, or exploiters rather than平等的成人关系.\n\nThe Gospel accounts contain no direct statements from Jesus about homosexuality. Jesus addresses divorce, lust, and marriage, but never specifically mentions same-sex relationships. This silence has been interpreted both ways—some argue it indicates Jesus' non-concern with the issue, while others note that Jesus' affirmation of Genesis 2:24 presupposes heterosexual complementarity.\n\n## Interpretive Frameworks\n\nHow Christians resolve these biblical questions depends significantly on the interpretive approaches they bring to Scripture. Several distinct frameworks have emerged within contemporary Christianity.\n\n### The Traditional View\n\nMany Christians, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Churches, most evangelical Protestants, and many Pentecostals, maintain that Scripture clearly prohibits same-sex sexual relationships. Proponents of this view argue several points.\n\nFirst, they note the consistency of biblical testimony across both Testaments. The Levitical prohibitions, Paul's teaching in Romans and the pastoral epistles, and the creation theology in Genesis all point toward the same conclusion. The biblical authors, they argue, would have understood same-sex intercourse as contrary to God's design regardless of whether specific passages address modern concepts of sexual orientation or committed partnerships.\n\nSecond, traditionalists often appeal to natural law reasoning. The complementarity of male and female bodies, they argue, indicates a design purpose that same-sex relationships cannot fulfill. Romans 1:26-27's characterization of same-sex relations as \"contrary to nature\" (*para physin*) supports this reading, suggesting that these acts violate something fundamental about human constitution.\n\nThird, proponents emphasize the creational theology embedded throughout Scripture. The Genesis creation narrative establishes male and female as complementary partners meant for one flesh union. Jesus himself affirms this framework. Same-sex relationships, on this reading, cannot reflect the original divine design for human sexuality.\n\nThe traditional position typically holds that Christians should welcome persons with same-sex attractions into the church while maintaining that acting upon those attractions constitutes sin. Celibate singleness, rather than same-sex partnership, represents the faithful response for Christians who experience homosexual attraction.\n\n### The Revisionist View\n\nOther Christians, including many in mainline Protestant traditions, read the biblical evidence differently. They argue that Scripture does not prohibit faithful, loving same-sex relationships and that the biblical prohibitions address practices fundamentally different from contemporary gay and lesbian partnerships.\n\nRevisionists note that the biblical passages, properly understood, target specific exploitative or cultic contexts rather than consensual adult relationships. The Levitical prohibitions, they argue, address pagan religious practices and the exploitation associated with temple prostitution. Paul's terminology in *arsenokoitai* likely refers to temple prostitutes, pederasts, or slaveholders who exploited slaves—situations involving power imbalances fundamentally different from平等 mutual love.\n\nFurthermore, revisionists emphasize that the biblical authors had no concept of sexual orientation as we understand it today. The modern understanding of same-sex attraction as an enduring, involuntary orientation shaping one's capacity for relationship did not exist in biblical cultures. When Paul condemned same-sex intercourse, revisionists argue, he addressed behavior that in his context typically involved exploitation, prostitution, or infidelity rather than faithful partnership.\n\nProponents also point to what they see as the overarching themes of Scripture—creation, redemption, covenant, and love—as taking precedence over specific prohibitions. The witness of Scripture to God's inclusive love, the fellowship of the early church that crossed social boundaries, and the ethical emphasis on faith expressing itself through love all suggest that faithful same-sex relationships can be consistent with Christian teaching.\n\nThe revisionist position typically holds that Christians may enter same-sex marriages or committed partnerships as expressions of the grace of God, though practices vary regarding whether such unions are considered sacramental marriages or blessed partnerships.\n\n### Nuanced Positions\n\nBetween these poles exist various nuanced positions that attempt to take seriously both biblical teaching and the lived experience of Christians with same-sex attractions.\n\nSome Christian scholars and traditions hold that same-sex sexual activity is indeed prohibited by Scripture but that this prohibition belongs to the ceremonial or cultural aspects of biblical law rather than its moral core. On this reading, the Levitical prohibitions fall into the same category as dietary restrictions—legislation appropriate for ancient Israel but fulfilled in Christ. They would argue that the moral law of Scripture, distilled into commands to love God and neighbor, does not inherently prohibit faithful same-sex relationships.\n\nOthers maintain that the biblical prohibitions are morally binding but emphasize the distinction between orientation and action. They welcome persons with same-sex attractions into full church membership while calling them to celibate fidelity. This position often emphasizes the broader biblical call to chastity, noting that heterosexual persons are also called to sexual restraint outside marriage.\n\nStill others engage in what might be called \"disagreeable communion\"—holding traditional convictions about homosexuality while practicing church fellowship with Christians who disagree, recognizing that sincere Christians differ on this issue and that unity in Christ transcends full agreement on contested matters.\n\n## Theological Considerations\n\nSeveral broader theological considerations inform these debates.\n\nThe doctrine of Scripture itself plays a significant role. Christians who hold to biblical inerrancy or strong verbal plenary inspiration often reach different conclusions than those with more nuanced views of biblical authority. The relationship between cultural context and biblical teaching—whether Paul was addressing universal moral principles or culturally-specific applications—remains contested.\n\nThe doctrine of creation and the relationship between creation and redemption also matters significantly. Does the creation narrative establish norms that remain binding, or does Christ's redemptive work constitute a new creation that may transcend or transform creational structures? Different answers to this question yield different conclusions about homosexuality.\n\nThe relationship between law and gospel, particularly prominent in Lutheran and Reformed traditions, shapes how Christians weigh biblical commands. The question of whether Old Testament prohibitions retain binding force for Christians—and if so, which ones—continues to generate significant discussion.\n\nThe doctrine of the church and the community's ongoing interpretive tradition also carries weight. The Catholic and Orthodox traditions especially emphasize the teaching authority of the church in discerning scriptural interpretation across time. The fact that the historical church has overwhelmingly prohibited same-sex sexual relations carries significant authority for these traditions, even as they engage contemporary questions.\n\n## Pastoral Sensitivity\n\nWhatever theological conclusions Christians reach, pastoral sensitivity requires recognizing that this question is not abstract. Real people—with real feelings, real desires for love and companionship, real stakes in how the church responds—sit at the center of these debates. Christians on all sides of this issue have sometimes failed to exhibit the love and respect that should characterize the body of Christ.\n\nThose holding traditional positions have sometimes spoken with cruelty or contempt, failing to distinguish between action and orientation, between sin and person. The church must welcome persons with same-sex attractions as full members of the body of Christ, accompanying them with love and compassion regardless of where they find themselves on questions of sexual ethics.\n\nThose holding revisionist positions have sometimes shown impatience with traditional believers, dismissing their convictions as mere prejudice or cultural bias rather than sincere attempts to understand Scripture. The church must listen respectfully to those who find the traditional reading of Scripture compelling, acknowledging the genuine difficulty of these questions.\n\nAll Christians must remember that the gospel addresses every person as a sinner in need of grace. No human being stands beyond the reach of God's mercy or beyond the call to holiness. The Christian life is one of ongoing transformation, and every Christian wrestles with some area of struggle, whether visible to others or hidden within.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe question of what Scripture teaches about homosexuality does not admit of easy answers. Serious, sincere Christians examining the same biblical texts have reached different conclusions. The traditional reading, holding that same-sex sexual relationships are prohibited by Scripture, remains the position of most Christians worldwide and across history. The revisionist reading, holding that Scripture does not address faithful same-sex partnerships, has gained significant traction in many Western churches.\n\nWhat remains essential is that Christians continue to engage these questions with humility, rigor, and love—submitting Scripture to careful study, recognizing the limits of our own cultural situatedness, and extending to one another the grace that we ourselves have received in Christ. The church's witness to the gospel depends upon our ability to hold firm to scriptural conviction while speaking to every human being with the compassion of Christ, who came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.# The Bible and Homosexuality: A Theological Survey\n\nThe question of what Scripture teaches about homosexuality remains one of the most debated and pastorally significant issues facing contemporary Christianity.

Christians across the theological spectrum engage the same biblical texts yet arrive at markedly different conclusions. A thorough examination requires honest engagement with the relevant passages, awareness of the interpretive frameworks applied to them, and sensitivity to the real human lives shaped by these theological conclusions.\n\n## The Biblical Texts\n\nThe Bible contains several passages that address same-sex sexual behavior, though fewer than many Christians assume. Understanding what these texts actually say—and what they meant in their original contexts—is essential for any theological evaluation.\n\n### Old Testament Provisions\n\nThe most explicit Old Testament prohibition appears in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13. Leviticus 18:22 states: \"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\" The term used (*toevah*) indicates something ritually impure or ceremonially forbidden rather than simply morally wrong. Leviticus 20:13 prescribes the death penalty for the act: \"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.\"\n\nThese prohibitions exist within a Holiness Code that addresses numerous ritual and ethical requirements. The surrounding chapters prohibit bestiality, child sacrifice, pagan sexual rites, and various other practices. Some scholars note that the immediate context involves cultic prostitution associated with pagan worship, suggesting the prohibitions may have been targeted specifically at religious prostitution rather than private, committed relationships between Israelites. Others argue that the absolute language of the prohibition extends beyond cultic contexts to address all same-sex intercourse.\n\nThe creation narrative in Genesis also carries interpretive significance. The establishment of male and female as complementary partners in Genesis 1:27 and the famous \"helpmeet\" passage in Genesis 2:24 have been invoked to support the idea that heterosexual marriage represents the original divine design. Jesus himself references Genesis 2:24 in Matthew 19:4-5, though in the context of addressing divorce rather than homosexuality specifically.\n\n### New Testament Teachings\n\nThe New Testament contains fewer explicit references, but those that exist carry significant theological weight for Christian ethics.\n\nRomans 1:26-27 represents the most extended biblical discussion of same-sex sexual activity. Paul writes that women \"exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones\" and men \"gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another.\" The passage describes these behaviors as dishonorable, contrary to nature, and resulting from humanity's broader rejection of God. Some interpreters argue that Paul addresses specifically exploitative, lustful, or cultic contexts rather than faithful, loving relationships. Others contend that the blanket characterization of same-sex intercourse as \"unnatural\" (*para physin*) extends to all such relationships regardless of their relational context.\n\nFirst Corinthians 6:9-11 and First Timothy 1:8-10 include same-sex offenders (*malakoi* and *arsenokoitai*) in lists of those who \"will not inherit the kingdom of God.\" The precise meaning of these Greek terms is debated. *Malakoi* literally means \"soft\" and may refer to effeminate men or those who take the passive role in same-sex intercourse. *Arsenokoitai* appears to be Paul's own coinage, combining \"male\" and \"bed,\" though its precise application remains uncertain. Some scholars suggest these terms target temple prostitutes, pederasts, or exploiters rather than平等的成人关系.\n\nThe Gospel accounts contain no direct statements from Jesus about homosexuality. Jesus addresses divorce, lust, and marriage, but never specifically mentions same-sex relationships. This silence has been interpreted both ways—some argue it indicates Jesus' non-concern with the issue, while others note that Jesus' affirmation of Genesis 2:24 presupposes heterosexual complementarity.\n\n## Interpretive Frameworks\n\nHow Christians resolve these biblical questions depends significantly on the interpretive approaches they bring to Scripture. Several distinct frameworks have emerged within contemporary Christianity.\n\n### The Traditional View\n\nMany Christians, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Churches, most evangelical Protestants, and many Pentecostals, maintain that Scripture clearly prohibits same-sex sexual relationships. Proponents of this view argue several points.\n\nFirst, they note the consistency of biblical testimony across both Testaments. The Levitical prohibitions, Paul's teaching in Romans and the pastoral epistles, and the creation theology in Genesis all point toward the same conclusion. The biblical authors, they argue, would have understood same-sex intercourse as contrary to God's design regardless of whether specific passages address modern concepts of sexual orientation or committed partnerships.\n\nSecond, traditionalists often appeal to natural law reasoning. The complementarity of male and female bodies, they argue, indicates a design purpose that same-sex relationships cannot fulfill. Romans 1:26-27's characterization of same-sex relations as \"contrary to nature\" (*para physin*) supports this reading, suggesting that these acts violate something fundamental about human constitution.\n\nThird, proponents emphasize the creational theology embedded throughout Scripture. The Genesis creation narrative establishes male and female as complementary partners meant for one flesh union. Jesus himself affirms this framework. Same-sex relationships, on this reading, cannot reflect the original divine design for human sexuality.\n\nThe traditional position typically holds that Christians should welcome persons with same-sex attractions into the church while maintaining that acting upon those attractions constitutes sin. Celibate singleness, rather than same-sex partnership, represents the faithful response for Christians who experience homosexual attraction.\n\n### The Revisionist View\n\nOther Christians, including many in mainline Protestant traditions, read the biblical evidence differently. They argue that Scripture does not prohibit faithful, loving same-sex relationships and that the biblical prohibitions address practices fundamentally different from contemporary gay and lesbian partnerships.\n\nRevisionists note that the biblical passages, properly understood, target specific exploitative or cultic contexts rather than consensual adult relationships. The Levitical prohibitions, they argue, address pagan religious practices and the exploitation associated with temple prostitution. Paul's terminology in *arsenokoitai* likely refers to temple prostitutes, pederasts, or slaveholders who exploited slaves—situations involving power imbalances fundamentally different from平等 mutual love.\n\nFurthermore, revisionists emphasize that the biblical authors had no concept of sexual orientation as we understand it today. The modern understanding of same-sex attraction as an enduring, involuntary orientation shaping one's capacity for relationship did not exist in biblical cultures. When Paul condemned same-sex intercourse, revisionists argue, he addressed behavior that in his context typically involved exploitation, prostitution, or infidelity rather than faithful partnership.\n\nProponents also point to what they see as the overarching themes of Scripture—creation, redemption, covenant, and love—as taking precedence over specific prohibitions. The witness of Scripture to God's inclusive love, the fellowship of the early church that crossed social boundaries, and the ethical emphasis on faith expressing itself through love all suggest that faithful same-sex relationships can be consistent with Christian teaching.\n\nThe revisionist position typically holds that Christians may enter same-sex marriages or committed partnerships as expressions of the grace of God, though practices vary regarding whether such unions are considered sacramental marriages or blessed partnerships.\n\n### Nuanced Positions\n\nBetween these poles exist various nuanced positions that attempt to take seriously both biblical teaching and the lived experience of Christians with same-sex attractions.\n\nSome Christian scholars and traditions hold that same-sex sexual activity is indeed prohibited by Scripture but that this prohibition belongs to the ceremonial or cultural aspects of biblical law rather than its moral core. On this reading, the Levitical prohibitions fall into the same category as dietary restrictions—legislation appropriate for ancient Israel but fulfilled in Christ. They would argue that the moral law of Scripture, distilled into commands to love God and neighbor, does not inherently prohibit faithful same-sex relationships.\n\nOthers maintain that the biblical prohibitions are morally binding but emphasize the distinction between orientation and action. They welcome persons with same-sex attractions into full church membership while calling them to celibate fidelity. This position often emphasizes the broader biblical call to chastity, noting that heterosexual persons are also called to sexual restraint outside marriage.\n\nStill others engage in what might be called \"disagreeable communion\"—holding traditional convictions about homosexuality while practicing church fellowship with Christians who disagree, recognizing that sincere Christians differ on this issue and that unity in Christ transcends full agreement on contested matters.\n\n## Theological Considerations\n\nSeveral broader theological considerations inform these debates.\n\nThe doctrine of Scripture itself plays a significant role. Christians who hold to biblical inerrancy or strong verbal plenary inspiration often reach different conclusions than those with more nuanced views of biblical authority. The relationship between cultural context and biblical teaching—whether Paul was addressing universal moral principles or culturally-specific applications—remains contested.\n\nThe doctrine of creation and the relationship between creation and redemption also matters significantly. Does the creation narrative establish norms that remain binding, or does Christ's redemptive work constitute a new creation that may transcend or transform creational structures? Different answers to this question yield different conclusions about homosexuality.\n\nThe relationship between law and gospel, particularly prominent in Lutheran and Reformed traditions, shapes how Christians weigh biblical commands. The question of whether Old Testament prohibitions retain binding force for Christians—and if so, which ones—continues to generate significant discussion.\n\nThe doctrine of the church and the community's ongoing interpretive tradition also carries weight. The Catholic and Orthodox traditions especially emphasize the teaching authority of the church in discerning scriptural interpretation across time. The fact that the historical church has overwhelmingly prohibited same-sex sexual relations carries significant authority for these traditions, even as they engage contemporary questions.\n\n## Pastoral Sensitivity\n\nWhatever theological conclusions Christians reach, pastoral sensitivity requires recognizing that this question is not abstract. Real people—with real feelings, real desires for love and companionship, real stakes in how the church responds—sit at the center of these debates. Christians on all sides of this issue have sometimes failed to exhibit the love and respect that should characterize the body of Christ.\n\nThose holding traditional positions have sometimes spoken with cruelty or contempt, failing to distinguish between action and orientation, between sin and person. The church must welcome persons with same-sex attractions as full members of the body of Christ, accompanying them with love and compassion regardless of where they find themselves on questions of sexual ethics.\n\nThose holding revisionist positions have sometimes shown impatience with traditional believers, dismissing their convictions as mere prejudice or cultural bias rather than sincere attempts to understand Scripture. The church must listen respectfully to those who find the traditional reading of Scripture compelling, acknowledging the genuine difficulty of these questions.\n\nAll Christians must remember that the gospel addresses every person as a sinner in need of grace. No human being stands beyond the reach of God's mercy or beyond the call to holiness. The Christian life is one of ongoing transformation, and every Christian wrestles with some area of struggle, whether visible to others or hidden within.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe question of what Scripture teaches about homosexuality does not admit of easy answers. Serious, sincere Christians examining the same biblical texts have reached different conclusions. The traditional reading, holding that same-sex sexual relationships are prohibited by Scripture, remains the position of most Christians worldwide and across history. The revisionist reading, holding that Scripture does not address faithful same-sex partnerships, has gained significant traction in many Western churches.\n\nWhat remains essential is that Christians continue to engage these questions with humility, rigor, and love—submitting Scripture to careful study, recognizing the limits of our own cultural situatedness, and extending to one another the grace that we ourselves have received in Christ. The church's witness to the gospel depends upon our ability to hold firm to scriptural conviction while speaking to every human being with the compassion of Christ, who came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.# The Bible and Homosexuality: A Theological Survey\n\nThe question of what Scripture teaches about homosexuality remains one of the most debated and pastorally significant issues facing contemporary Christianity. Christians across the theological spectrum engage the same biblical texts yet arrive at markedly different conclusions. A thorough examination requires honest engagement with the relevant passages, awareness of the interpretive frameworks applied to them, and sensitivity to the real human lives shaped by these theological conclusions.\n\n## The Biblical Texts\n\nThe Bible contains several passages that address same-sex sexual behavior, though fewer than many Christians assume. Understanding what these texts actually say—and what they meant in their original contexts—is essential for any theological evaluation.\n\n### Old Testament Provisions\n\nThe most explicit Old Testament prohibition appears in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13. Leviticus 18:22 states: \"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\" The term used (*toevah*) indicates something ritually impure or ceremonially forbidden rather than simply morally wrong. Leviticus 20:13 prescribes the death penalty for the act: \"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.\"\n\nThese prohibitions exist within a Holiness Code that addresses numerous ritual and ethical requirements. The surrounding chapters prohibit bestiality, child sacrifice, pagan sexual rites, and various other practices. Some scholars note that the immediate context involves cultic prostitution associated with pagan worship, suggesting the prohibitions may have been targeted specifically at religious prostitution rather than private, committed relationships between Israelites. Others argue that the absolute language of the prohibition extends beyond cultic contexts to address all same-sex intercourse.\n\nThe creation narrative in Genesis also carries interpretive significance. The establishment of male and female as complementary partners in Genesis 1:27 and the famous \"helpmeet\" passage in Genesis 2:24 have been invoked to support the idea that heterosexual marriage represents the original divine design. Jesus himself references Genesis 2:24 in Matthew 19:4-5, though in the context of addressing divorce rather than homosexuality specifically.\n\n### New Testament Teachings\n\nThe New Testament contains fewer explicit references, but those that exist carry significant theological weight for Christian ethics.\n\nRomans 1:26-27 represents the most extended biblical discussion of same-sex sexual activity. Paul writes that women \"exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones\" and men \"gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another.\" The passage describes these behaviors as dishonorable, contrary to nature, and resulting from humanity's broader rejection of God. Some interpreters argue that Paul addresses specifically exploitative, lustful, or cultic contexts rather than faithful, loving relationships. Others contend that the blanket characterization of same-sex intercourse as \"unnatural\" (*para physin*) extends to all such relationships regardless of their relational context.\n\nFirst Corinthians 6:9-11 and First Timothy 1:8-10 include same-sex offenders (*malakoi* and *arsenokoitai*) in lists of those who \"will not inherit the kingdom of God.\" The precise meaning of these Greek terms is debated. *Malakoi* literally means \"soft\" and may refer to effeminate men or those who take the passive role in same-sex intercourse. *Arsenokoitai* appears to be Paul's own coinage, combining \"male\" and \"bed,\" though its precise application remains uncertain. Some scholars suggest these terms target temple prostitutes, pederasts, or exploiters rather than平等的成人关系.\n\nThe Gospel accounts contain no direct statements from Jesus about homosexuality. Jesus addresses divorce, lust, and marriage, but never specifically mentions same-sex relationships. This silence has been interpreted both ways—some argue it indicates Jesus' non-concern with the issue, while others note that Jesus' affirmation of Genesis 2:24 presupposes heterosexual complementarity.\n\n## Interpretive Frameworks\n\nHow Christians resolve these biblical questions depends significantly on the interpretive approaches they bring to Scripture. Several distinct frameworks have emerged within contemporary Christianity.\n\n### The Traditional View\n\nMany Christians, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Churches, most evangelical Protestants, and many Pentecostals, maintain that Scripture clearly prohibits same-sex sexual relationships.
