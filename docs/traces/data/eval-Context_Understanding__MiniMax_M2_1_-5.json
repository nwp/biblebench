          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer aligns well with the core, traditional aim of the book of Revelation: to encourage persecuted believers by pointing to God’s ultimate victory over evil, the return of Christ, the judgment of earthly powers opposed to the faith, and the faithful’s inheritance of God’s eternal kingdom. This mirrors key biblical themes found in Revelation (e.g., Christ’s return in Revelation 19, God’s final victory in Revelation 20–21, and the final victory of the saints). It is consistent with historic Christian orthodoxy and Scripture. The response could be enhanced by noting the 'already/not yet' tension (present suffering with future fulfillment), and by mentioning the apocalyptic, symbolic genre and the broader exhortations toward worship, repentance, and steadfast faith within the letters to the churches; but these are nuances rather than doctrinal errors."
