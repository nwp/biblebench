        "input": "Should churches prioritize social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "No, churches should not *prioritize* social justice issues like racial reconciliation and economic inequality above their core mission, though they should address them as part of holistic Christian obedience. Here's why, grounded in Scripture, history, and practical reality:\n\n### 1. **Biblical Priorities: Gospel First, Justice as Fruit**\n   - Jesus' Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) commands making disciples, baptizing, and teaching obedience to *all* He commanded—not just social reform. The apostles echoed this: Paul preached \"Christ crucified\" (1 Corinthians 1:23) amid Roman inequality and ethnic tensions, without making activism his lead.\n   - Social justice flows from the gospel but isn't the main event. Micah 6:8 calls for justice, mercy, and humility *toward God first*. James 2:14-17 ties faith to works (feeding the poor), but warns against faith without the transformative power of Christ. Prioritizing justice risks inverting this: works without gospel = \"social gospel\" heresy, as critiqued by Dietrich Bonhoeffer.\n   - Jesus healed and fed multitudes (e.g., 5,000 in John 6), but when they sought more bread without Him, He pivoted to \"I am the bread of life.\" Eternal souls > temporary fixes.\n\n### 2. **Historical Lessons: Mission Drift Leads to Decline**\n   - 19th-20th century \"Social Gospel\" movement (e.g., Walter Rauschenbusch) prioritized poverty and labor rights over evangelism. It birthed liberal mainline denominations (e.g., UCC, ELCA), which have hemorrhaged members (down 30-50% since 1960s per Pew data) while secular NGOs took over welfare.\n   - Contrast with gospel-focused churches: Evangelicals grew explosively post-WWII by emphasizing personal salvation amid civil rights (MLK Jr. himself preached repentance first). Billy Graham integrated justice (anti-segregation crusades) without letting it eclipse soul-winning.\n   - Today, politicized \"justice\" emphasis correlates with polarization: Barna data shows U.S. churches splitting over BLM/CRT vs. traditional views, eroding unity (Ephesians 4:3).\n\n### 3. **Practical Risks and Alternatives**\n   | Prioritizing Social Justice | Integrating It Subordinately |\n   |-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n   | **Pros**: Mobilizes action, attracts activists. | **Pros**: Sustainable, gospel-powered change (e.g., Wilberforce ended slavery via faith). |\n   | **Cons**: Alienates half the congregation (Gallup: 40% of Americans see churches as too political); dilutes evangelism; competes with experts (gov't, nonprofits handle scale better). | **Cons**: None major—addresses root sin (racism as heart issue, per Jeremiah 17:9). |\n   | **Outcome**: Shrinking, divided churches. | **Outcome**: Thriving witness (e.g., Saddleback Church's orphan care + preaching). |\n\n   Churches excel at *personal* transformation: mentoring ex-cons beats policy debates. Data from World Vision/Compassion International shows Christian aid reduces poverty 2-3x more effectively when tied to discipleship.\n\n### Bottom Line\nChurches should proclaim Christ as King—reconciling people to God (2 Corinthians 5:18-20), which naturally spills into racial healing (Galatians 3:28) and generosity (Acts 4:32-35). Prioritizing justice flips the script to humanism with a cross. As C.S. Lewis quipped, \"Good philosophy must exist... but [it] has far less use than bread.\" Swap \"philosophy\" for \"justice activism,\" and it fits.\n\nWhat do you think—does your church strike this balance, or lean one way?",
