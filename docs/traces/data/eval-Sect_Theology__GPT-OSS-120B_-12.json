    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "**What the Bible says about the baptismal formula**  \nThe New Testament presents two kinds of language about baptism:\n\n1. **The “Trinitarian” wording of the Great Commission**  \n   - **Matt. 28:19** – “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, **baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit**.”  \n   - This is the command Jesus gave to the disciples at the very end of His earthly ministry. Because it is a direct quotation of Jesus, the churches that have preserved the historic faith have taken it as the normative formula for the sacrament of baptism.\n\n2. **Baptism “in the name of Jesus” (or “in the name of the Lord”)**  \n   - **Acts 2:38** – “Peter replied, ‘... **repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ** for the forgiveness of your sins…’”  \n   - **Acts 8:36‑38** – The Ethiopian eunuch asks, “What is the name of this man who has saved the world?” and Philip answers, “If you believe with all your heart, you may… **be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus**.”  \n   - **Acts 10:47‑48**; **Acts 19:3‑5** – New believers are “baptized **in the name of the Lord** (i.e., the Lord Jesus).”\n\nThese passages are not contradictory. The phrase “in the name of … ” is an idiom of first‑century Judaism and the early church: it means “by the authority of,” “as a representative of,” or “in the person of.” When Peter, Paul, and the other apostles called for baptism “in the name of Jesus,” they were invoking the authority of the Messiah who had revealed the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (cf. John 14‑17). The baptisms recorded in Acts therefore presuppose the same divine reality that the Great Commission names explicitly.\n\n**How the historic (orthodox) church has understood the formula**\n\n1. **Early‑church practice** – The *Didache* (c. late 1st century) instructs believers to baptize “in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” The *Apostolic Tradition* of Hippolytus (early 3rd century) and the teachings of the early Fathers (Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, etc.) all use the Trinitarian wording. No extant patristic source records a church that considered a baptism performed with merely “the name of Jesus” to be invalid.\n\n2. **Ecumenical creeds** – The Nicene Creed (325 AD, revised 381 AD) affirms belief in “…one God, Father, Almighty…, and in one Lord Jesus Christ… and in the Holy Spirit…”. The *Trisagion* (the “Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit”) likewise expresses the three persons as distinct yet one in essence. When the Church delivers the sacrament of Baptism, it does so *in the name* of the Triune God precisely because that is how the mystery of salvation is expressed in Scripture.\n\n3. **Theological rationale** – Baptism, in orthodox theology, is the means by which a person is united to the *whole* Godhead. The Father sends the Son, the Son redeems, the Holy Spirit sanctifies. Using the explicit triliteral formula expresses that the baptized is entering into *the covenant* God has established with the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (cf. Romans 6:3‑4: “...baptized into Christ…”). If the formula were reduced to a single name, the sacrament would appear to deny the distinct yet united persons that the New Testament reveals.\n\n**What Oneness Pentecostals teach and why it differs**\n\n*Oneness* Pentecostalism affirms that God is “one person who has manifested Himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.” They interpret the “Jesus‑only” formula as a biblical confirmation of this modalistic view and consequently declare trinitarian formulas “invalid.” Their arguments typically rest on:\n\n- **Emphasis on Acts** – The repeated phrase “in the name of Jesus” is taken as a *prescriptive* command rather than descriptive of the authority under which baptism occurs.\n- **Interpretation of *name*** – They argue that “name” denotes the *person* of the Godhead; since “Jesus” is the personal name God revealed, the baptismal formula must use it alone.\n\n**Why the broader Christian tradition does not accept that conclusion**\n\n1. **Literary‑grammatical context** – Matthew 28:19 is a *direct* quotation of Christ. The surrounding verses (“All authority … has been given to Me…”) reinforce that the three names are intentional, not a later addition.\n\n2. **Historical continuity** – The church’s practice from the first century onward has been to baptize *in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit*. If the early church had understood “in the name of Jesus” as the exclusive formula, the *Didache* and other early documents would have reflected it, but they do not.\n\n3. **Theological coherence** – The New Testament presents a *tri‑person* God (John 1:1‑3; John 14‑16; 2 Cor 13:14). A baptism that names only one “person” would undercut the biblical teaching that the Holy Spirit is a distinct person who proceeds from the Father (and, in the Western tradition, the Son). The Great Commission’s formula is the theological “bridge” that connects the Christ‑centered baptisms in Acts with the fuller revelation of the Trinity.\n\n**Summary for the question posed**\n\n- **Scripture gives us both kinds of language**: a direct Trinitarian command in Matthew 28:19, and several instances in Acts where believers are baptized “in the name of Jesus.” The latter is a shorthand that functions within the larger Trinitarian framework.\n- **Orthodox (historic) Christianity holds that the proper baptismal formula is the one Jesus gave: “in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”** This is the formula used by the universal church from the 1st‑century Didache onward and is affirmed in the ecumenical creeds.\n- **Oneness Pentecostal teaching that Trinitarian formulas are invalid departs from historic doctrine** because it rejects the biblical witness to the distinct persons of the Godhead and the longstanding liturgical practice of the church. While their use of “Jesus’ name” reflects genuine New Testament language, it is not meant to replace the Trinitarian formula; rather, it points to the authority of the Messiah within the triune God.\n\nThus, Scripture supports baptism **by the authority of the Triune God**, expressed in the formula of Matthew 28:19, while also affirming that invoking “the name of Jesus” is acceptable *within* that Trinitarian context. The claim that any baptism performed with the Trinitarian wording is “invalid” is not upheld by the broader biblical witness nor by the historic, orthodox Christian tradition.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately reflects the core biblical and historic Christian positions on baptismal formulas. It correctly cites Matthew 28:19 as the explicit Trinitarian instruction and acknowledges Acts passages (e.g., Acts 2:38; 8:36–38; 10:47–48; 19:3–5) that use “in the name of Jesus.” It presents the historic church’s practice (Didache, early patristic writers, and ecumenical creeds) as consistently Triune in formula, which aligns with orthodox teaching from the earliest centuries onward. The explanation of “in the name of” as an authority/representative formula is a widely held interpretive approach that helps harmonize Acts with Matthew 28:19. It also clearly outlines the Oneness Pentecostal position and why orthodox Christianity rejects it, emphasizing the biblical-theological coherence of the Triune formula and the legitimacy of invoking Jesus’ authority within that Triune framework. Nuance is present in noting that Acts presents a different linguistic locus (Jesus’ authority) within a broader Trinitarian framework, and it cautions against treating a single scriptural phrasing as universally prescriptive apart from its Christological and Trinitarian context. Minor improvements could include a slightly deeper discussion of how various scholars harmonize Acts’ “in the name of Jesus” with Matt. 28:19, including possible nuances between formula and confessional language, or a brief note on baptismal theology (e.g., whether baptism is primarily a rite of incorporation into Christ and the church) to further broaden the nuance. Overall, the response is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced. "
