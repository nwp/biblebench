    "expected": "",
    "output": "**The biblical text on same‑sex sexuality is not a single, unequivocal statement but a set of passages written by different authors in particular historical and cultural situations.  How those passages are read has become the chief dividing line between the “traditional” and the “progressive” strands of contemporary Christian theology.  Below is a brief survey of the most‑quoted scriptures, the historical‑critical clues that shape their meaning, and the way a few major streams of Christian thought interpret them.**\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Old‑Testament “Purity” Code (Leviticus)\n\n| Passage | Traditional reading | Progressive / re‑readings |\n|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Leviticus 18 :22** – “You shall not lie with a male as with a woman.” | A categorical ban on all male–male sexual contact. | Contextualists argue the law governed sexual activities that violated the “molestation” of the covenantal relationship between peoples and God; it may capture at least a subset of exploitative or idolatrous acts. |\n| **Leviticus 20 :13** – “If a man lies with a male in a shameful way, ...” | A harsh penalty (death) for “unnatural” sexual acts. | Some scholars read “zzwʿ” (which literally means “shame”) as a condemnation of exploitative, non‑consensual, or idolatrous practices rather than condemning all same‑sex desire. |\n\n**Key point:** The Levitical laws were part of Israel’s “Holiness Code” aimed at setting Israel apart. The most common view is that this was a moral prohibition with both religious and sociopolitical implications, not a prescriptive guide for all Christian conduct. Modern biblical scholars often stress that these laws cannot be read as “the model for universal Christian ethics.”\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Gospel context: Sodom and “orphan” metaphors\n\n| Passage | Traditional reading | Progressive / re‑readings |\n|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Genesis 19** – The destruction of Sodom & Gomorrah | A typology for sexual immorality and communal wickedness against the one‑true God. | Sodom’s sin has historically been linked to forced or exploitative sexual acts rather than consensual homosexual love; some see the text as condemning violence, violence of hospitality, and wickedness, not merely same‑sex relations. |\n| **Romans 1 :26‑27** – “Women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature.” | A condemnation of all same‑sex acts outside of marriage. | Critics claim the Greek word “arsenokoitai” may refer to men who engaged in exploitative, transactional sex (male prostitution) or to the practice of incest or pederasty. Romans could be applauding natural marriage rather than condemning orientation per se. |\n| **1 Corinthians 6 :9‑10** – “Catching cattle, brothel keepers, etc.” | Lists “arsenokoitai.” | “Arsenokoitai” shown to have a strong sense of idolatrous sexual exploitation in ancient Greco‑Roman world; not all equivalents for “homosexual” are full‑fledged identity categories. |\n| **1 Timothy 1 :9‑10** – “Arsenokoitai” and “malakoi.” | A reference to people “who practice male‑male sexual acts in a licentious manner.” | Same linguistic concerns; some argue the list reflects exploitative relationships, not necessarily all same‑sex loves. |\n\n**Commentary**: The Greek words used by Paul are, in context, part of a broader condemnation of sinful sexual practices often related to idolatry or exploitation. However, many evangelical scholars read them as referring to consensual same‑sex relations, and the text has become the core of a “sinful” teaching in most mainstream Protestant churches. Those who adopt a socio‑historical reading emphasize that Paul’s message is about “unnatural” sexual behavior as an expression of idolatry, not about attraction.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Covenant Marriage in the New Testament\n\n| Passage | Traditional reading | Progressive / re‑readings |\n|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Matthew 19:4‑6** – “A man will leave his parents and be joined to his wife” | Reinforces the male‑female covenant order as God‑ordained. | Recognizes that Jesus is not instituting a moral law in this section; instead, it affirms the biblical scriptural tradition of marriage. It does not directly de‑crown same‑sex relationships. |\n| **Ephesians 5:21‑33** – Husbands to love wives, wives to respect husbands | Model for same‑sex couples under discussion regarding marital mirroring | Some see the metaphor of husband/wife as both spiritual and physical; but it remains uniquely a heterosexual paradigm. |\n\n---\n\n### 4. How different Christian traditions interpret the above\n\n| Tradition | Core position | Points of contention |\n|-----------|---------------|----------------------|\n| **Catholicism** | *Same‑sex acts* are sinful “intrinsically disordered”; *orientation* is neutral. *Marriage* is only possible between a man and a woman. | Debate on whether the “intrinsic” classification was meant to describe all same‑sex activities or only specific kinds. |\n| **Orthodoxy** | Same view as Catholicism; loving, committed same‑sex relationships are not allowed. | Some emerging bishops advocate “insistent pastoral friendship” while maintaining doctrinal boundaries. |\n| **Mainstream Evangelicals** | Same‑sex relationships are sinful and contrary to Scripture; marriage is exclusively male‑female. | Many evangelicals agree on a biblical prohibition. The debate is around the extents: some think it applies to all sexual relationships of the same sex, whom you consider “sin” regardless of consent. |\n| **Progressive / Liberal Christianity** | The scriptural passages that appear to condemn homosexuality mainly refer to exploitative or idolatrous contexts (“pederasty, prostitution, and idolatrous worship”). Same‑sex intentional love is not sinful. | Some progressive churches (e.g., United Church of Christ, Episcopal Church) re‑interpret the Greek terms, claim “arsenokoitai” refers to non‑consensual or exploitative activities, and emphasize the central biblical themes of *love, justice, and covenant* to justify inclusion. |\n| **Messianic Judaism** | Many factions hold the same view as mainstream evangelical Messianic communities: same‑sex acts are disordered, but there’s an ongoing debate in some groups which are willing to see a more culturally contextual reading. | Tension between Jewish law (halacha) and Christian theology. |\n| **Pentecostal / Charismatic** | Usually Northern evangelical stance: same‑sex relationships are sinful. | Some charismatic groups allow for same‑sex love within the context of “faithful marriage” with a gender‑shifting view. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. What does the Bible *say* if we let the text speak on its own terms?\n\n1. **No single verse forbids â€œsame‑sex love”; the Bible speaks strongly against “unnatural” sexual acts in specific cultural and idolatrous contexts.**  \n   - “Natural” in the biblical texts is often understood not in arbitrary contemporary terms of *attraction* but in terms of *divinely ordained functions*—celibate (for worship), heterosexual (for birth), and faithful (for holy service). Any non‑conforming act is flagged as an imbalance (“unnatural”).  \n\n2. **Civil monotheism of the biblical worldview** insists that sexual relationships express and confirm covenant identity.  The Biblical command to love others as oneself is consistent with that.  \n\n3. **Concern for context**: Paul's epistles frequently address sexual exploitation, idolatry, and power imbalances.  The historical context includes temple prostitution, pederasty, and exploitative relationships that exploited political and economic inequalities.  \n\n4. **The *law* clauses** (e.g., Leviticus) are presented as covenant warnings for Israel’s distinct covenant; they are not explicitly normative for all Christians—but they remain part of the canon and thus provide moral reference points.  \n\n5. **Love & grace**: Passages such as 1 Corinthians 13 or the “love command” (John 13) are not absent.  Preaching on identity they preach “the child’s sin” vs. “the calling of grace.”  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Two common frameworks to illuminate debate\n\n| Framework | Application | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| **Contextual / Sociocultural** | Primary emphasis on the original milieu (political, religious, economic) of each passage. | “Arsenokoitai” may refer to men in sexual slavery or public prostitution rather than consensual lovers. |\n| **Theological / Normative** | Emphasis on the overarching message of Scripture (love, holiness, covenant). | Same‑sex partnerships that practice mutual consent, chastity, and a covenant structure could align with the broader biblical ethic of commitment. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. What a thoughtful, balanced answer looks like\n\n> **Does Scripture condemn homosexuality?**  \n> Scripture (particularly in the letters of Paul and the Levitical holiness code) condemns certain non‑consensual, exploitative, or idolatrous same‑sex sexual activities. How far this condemnation reaches into consensual, loving same‑sex relationships is debated.  \n>   \n> **Are all same‑sex relationships sinful?**  \n> Many evangelical perspectives hold that *all* same‑sex sexual intimacy is sinful because they see it as a deviation from God’s natural order. Progressive theologians argue that the Biblical texts directly speak against specific exploitative or cult‑gendered practices; when we re‑read the Greek and context, they find a possibility to allow for consecrated, spiritually committed same‑sex relationships.  \n\n---\n\n### 8. A few final pointers\n\n1. **Orientation vs. practice**: Most traditional readings treat *orientation* as neutral, focusing on *behavior*.  Progressive scholars question if orientation is ever outright sinful if it does not lead to sinful acts.  \n2. **Pastoral care**: Regardless of doctrinal position, the biblical call to *love* remains the attractor for how pastors and churches respond to LGBTQ people.  \n3. **Historical change**: Christianity has moved from civil constraints to spiritual identity.  The moral compass of a faith community often evolves as the community better understands context and the human experience.  \n\n---\n\n**Bottom line for a balanced view:**  \nThe Bible does contain passages that condemn specific same‑sex sexual practices, especially those tied to idolatry, exploitative power structures, or historical cult practices. How those passages apply to contemporary consensual same‑sex relationships is not straightforward and remains the core of theological contention. Progressives argue for a contextual reading that invites inclusion; conservatives interpret the biblical ethic as a universal prohibition. The ask by “Are homosexual relationships sinful or limited to exploitative contexts?” therefore cannot be answered definitively by a single verse, but rather by an exegetical, historical and theological deliberation—an approach that many Christian theologians today are still engaging with.",
