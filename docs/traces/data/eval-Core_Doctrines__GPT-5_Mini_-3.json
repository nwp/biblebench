    "input": "What is the doctrine of original sin?",
    "expected": "Original sin is the doctrine that all humanity inherited a sinful nature from Adam's fall. As a result, all people are born with a inclination toward sin and are spiritually separated from God. This doesn't mean infants are guilty of actual sins, but that human nature is corrupted and inclined toward evil apart from God's grace.",
    "output": "Concise definition\n- The doctrine of original sin teaches that because of Adam’s sin the human condition is fundamentally affected: sinful corruption and its consequences (especially death and estrangement from God) are passed on to all his descendants. This leaves every human morally and spiritually impaired—unable of themselves to attain saving fellowship with God—and in need of God’s saving grace in Christ.\n\nBiblical basis (key texts and their contribution)\n- Genesis 3 — The fall of Adam and Eve introduces sin and death into the human story; God’s curse on the ground, the promise of enmity, and the entry of death are the narrative roots of the doctrine.\n- Romans 5:12–21 — Paul draws a contrast between Adam and Christ: through one man sin and death entered the world; through the one man (Christ) the free gift of righteousness and life is given. Paul’s logic is foundational for the idea that Adam’s act has universal consequences and that Christ is the head and remedy for redeemed humanity.\n- Romans 3:23; 1 Corinthians 15:21–22 — “All have sinned” and “in Adam all die, in Christ all will be made alive” reinforce universality and the corporate/representative character of both Adam’s and Christ’s roles.\n- Psalm 51:5 — David’s words (“in sin did my mother conceive me,” NIV) are often cited to support the notion that human life begins under the effects of sin.\n- Ephesians 2:1–3 — Describes humanity as “dead in trespasses and sins,” under the dominion of sinful desires and spiritual forces, indicating radical moral dependence on God’s intervention.\n\nWhat the doctrine claims (core components)\n- Origin: The corruption originates in Adam’s disobedience (the “first sin”) and its consequences.\n- Universality: All humans share in the consequences—mortality, a proclivity to sin, and separation from God.\n- Transmission: The sinful condition is transmitted to descendants. Theologians distinguish between:\n  - “Original corruption” (inherited depravity or disordered nature),\n  - “Original guilt” or imputed guilt (debated: some traditions hold Adam’s guilt is imputed to his offspring; others speak only of inherited consequences),\n  - and “concupiscence” (the disorder of desires).\n- Radical inability: Humans, apart from divine grace, lack the spiritual ability to turn to God or do saving good.\n- Corporate/representative headship: Adam functions as a covenant head; by his act the human race falls; correspondingly Christ is the covenant head who redeems his people.\n\nMajor theological disagreements and nuances\n- Imputation vs. Inheritance: Western (Augustinian/Reformed) theology typically affirms imputed guilt—Adam’s guilt is rightly counted to his descendants—alongside inherited corruption. Eastern Orthodox theology generally rejects imputed guilt, speaking instead of ancestral sin: we inherit death, mortality, and a propensity to sin, but not the legal guilt of Adam. Many Roman Catholic and Protestant formulations affirm both corruption and the reality of guilt, but nuances vary (e.g., baptism and the remission of original guilt in Catholic sacramental theology).\n- Degree and language of “total depravity”: In Reformed thought “total depravity” means sin affects every dimension of human nature (mind, will, emotions, social life); it does not mean every person is as bad as they could be. Arminians affirm serious impairment but insist on prevenient grace enabling a free human response.\n- Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism: Pelagius denied original sin and affirmed human ability to obey God without special grace. Semi-Pelagianism admitted human inability but claimed the human will can initiate the move toward God, with grace completing it. These views were rejected by Western councils and classical Protestant and Catholic doctrine, which affirm the necessity of grace.\n\nHistorical development (brief)\n- Early church: Fathers such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, and especially Augustine (4th–5th c.) developed the doctrine against Pelagianism. Augustine emphasized the transmission of sin and the need for prevenient/irresistible grace.\n- Medieval and Reformed theology: Augustine’s legacy shaped medieval theology and was taken up and systematized by Reformers (Luther, Calvin), who emphasized human inability and the imputation of Adam’s sin and Christ’s righteousness.\n- Eastern Orthodox: Emphasizes ancestral sin, mortality, and a therapeutic view of salvation (theosis), resisting the forensic idea of inherited guilt.\n- Councils: Various regional councils (e.g., Council of Orange, 529) rejected semi-Pelagianism and affirmed the necessity of grace, while also tempering some Augustinian extremes.\n\nSoteriological and pastoral implications\n- Necessity of grace: Original sin makes divine, effectual grace indispensable for salvation (regeneration, justification, sanctification).\n- Christ as Second Adam: The doctrine highlights Christ’s role as the new representative head whose obedience and life secure righteousness and life for believers (central to Romans 5).\n- Church practices: It undergirds practices and doctrines such as infant baptism (in many traditions) as a sign/means of God’s preventing or dealing with original guilt and incorporating infants into the covenant community.\n- Pastoral nuance: The doctrine is not license for despair; it points to human need and God’s provision in Christ. It requires pastoral sensitivity to emphasize human responsibility without ever suggesting people can save themselves.\n\nContemporary questions and reworkings\n- Evolutionary anthropology and modern biology raise questions about how a historical Adam and a single first sin relate to the scientific account of human origins; theologians offer various models (literal historical head, representative head within a broader human population, theological reading of Adam as archetypal).\n- Social and structural sin: Some contemporary theologians emphasize systemic or structural dimensions of sin passed through culture and institutions alongside (or instead of) inherited guilt.\n\nSummary\n- Original sin is the doctrine that Adam’s fall introduced sin, death, and corrupted human nature into the human condition, so that all his descendants are born into a state of moral and spiritual brokenness and in need of God’s redeeming grace. Scripture (especially Genesis 3 and Romans 5) and Christian theological tradition interpret Christ as the remedy—the true “second Adam” who brings life and righteousness to those united to him.",

          "rationale": "The response accurately summarizes original sin, its biblical bases (Genesis 3; Romans 5; Romans 3; 1 Cor 15; Eph 2; Psalm 51:5 as cited in tradition), and major doctrinal distinctions (corruption vs guilt, total depravity, imputation vs inheritance). It correctly notes diverse perspectives (Augustinian/Reformed emphasis on imputed guilt and corruption; EasternOrthodox emphasis on ancestral sin and mortality; Catholic/other Western views). It also covers soteriological implications and historical development, including Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian critiques and contemporary reworkings. Minor caveats include the contested interpretation of Psalm 51:5 as a universal statement and the nuanced, non-universal practice of infant baptism across all traditions. Overall, the content is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and appropriately nuanced."

It accurately notes major doctrinal debates (imputation vs. inheritance, total depravity, Pelagianism/Semi-Pelagianism) and situates them historically (Augustine, Reformers, Eastern Orthodoxy, Catholicism). There are no explicit heretical claims. A few points could be clarified for precision:\n- The phrase about \"original guilt\" being imputed to descendants is debated across traditions; Western traditions typically affirm both corruption and imputational guilt, while Eastern Orthodoxy emphasizes ancestral sin without imputing guilt.\n- Catholic teaching distinguishes the remission of original guilt (baptism removes the guilt and the stain) from the ongoing effects of original sin; the wording could be tightened to reflect that nuance.\n- The term \"preventing grace\" appears; the standard term in some traditions is \"prevenient grace\" (Arminian) or simply \"grace\" depending on the context.\n- The discussion of infant baptism as sign/means of incorporation is accurate in many traditions but varies in emphasis across denominations.\nOverall, no heresy is detected; the text could improve with slightly tighter terminology on guilt, baptismal effects, and the range of doctrinal nuances among traditions."
