    "input": "Some Oneness Pentecostals teach that baptism must be performed 'in Jesus' name only' and that Trinitarian baptism formulas are invalid. What does Scripture teach?",
    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "**Short answer**\n\nThe New Testament contains one clear, explicit command for baptism, found in Matthew 28:19‑20: “baptize…in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”  The bulk of orthodox Christian tradition holds that this Trinitarian formula is the apostolic norm.  \nOneness‑Pentecostal usage—“baptism *in Jesus’ name only*”—finds support in a handful of passages (e.g., Acts 2:38, John 20:23) in which Jesus’ name is cited.  Those verses do not oppose the Trinitarian formula; rather, they emphasize that *Jesus* is a name for the divine.  Consequently, the Oneness position is read by most scholars and churches as a theological minority view, one that departs from the broader New‑Testament teaching and the historic consensus of the church.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Scriptural Evidence\n\n| Scriptural passage | What it says | What it’s often used for |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Matthew 28:19‑20** | “Go… baptize … *in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit*.” | The canonical, Trinitarian formula; the primary New Testament command for baptism. |\n| **Mark 16:15‑16** | “… baptizing all nations, and teaching them…  (*baptizing them…*).\" | No formula is written, but Christ’s broader command to baptize is implicit. |\n| **Acts 2:38** | “Repent… and be baptized *in His name*.” | Often quoted for baptism *in Jesus’ name* (Oneness). |\n| **Acts 8:38‑39; 12:10** | “Peter and John… were baptized and received the Holy Ghost.” | No formula is cited; however, the context implies standard practice, not specific wording. |\n| **John 20:23** | “If you hold *the confession of the dead* to be true, all that you *ask* for in my name…” | Emphasises Jesus’ name as a divine address, used by some as proof of sufficiency. |\n| **Acts 16:15, 17:10; 1 Tim 3:16** | These do **not** mention a formula; they use *in the name of the Holy Lord* or *in the name of Jesus* to denote the deity as a whole. | Used by proponents of non‑Trinitarianism to argue that the name of the one God was the correct formula. |\n\n### Key points from the passages\n\n1. **The only explicit Trinitarian command** is in Matthew 28:19‑20.\n2. **Other passages use the singular “name”** (“in His name,” “in the name of Jesus”), but the context shows *the Lord is the one God,* not an exclusive reference to the human incarnation alone.\n3. **No biblical passage proscribes** the Trinitarian formula; no example in the text states that such a formula is invalid.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Theological Interpretation Within Orthodoxy\n\n| Aspect | Orthodox Interpretation | Why it matters |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Meaning of “name” in Matthew 28 :19 | “Name” (Greek *onoma*) is used in the singular to refer to the unified God‑person; the formula addresses *the one divine Essence* in three persons.* | It reflects the Trinitarian understanding that the Lord possesses Father, Son, and Spirit roles, but is a single divine being. |\n| **Purpose of Baptism** | Initiation into the community, identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus, and incorporation into the Trinity (Romans 6:3‑4; Ephesians 4:5). | Baptism mirrors the Triune God’s work. |\n| **Historical practice** | The earliest baptisms were likely carried out under the Trinitarian formula (cf. *1 Cor 1:12*; *C.1.1‑1.2*, *C.1.5‑1.6* in the Apostolic Constitutions). By the late 2nd‑3rd centuries the formula was codified in the *Nicene* creed and early church praxis. | Consistency with the apostolic tradition is essential for sacramental validity. |\n| **What “in Jesus’ name” means** | Jesus is the *Name* of God (John 1:1; 12:27, 27). “Baptize *in Jesus' name*” is a shorthand for “baptize *in the unified name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit*.” | It does not negate the Trinitarian structure; it simply highlights the Person of the Son as the visible and personal aspect of God. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Oneness‑Pentecostal Perspective\n\n| Statement | Supporting rationale | Where it diverges from orthodoxy |\n|---|---|---|\n| Baptism *must* be “*in Jesus' name only*.” | • The biblical command in Matthew 28 :19 is understood as a *summation.* <br>• Jesus’ own use of “in His name” (Acts 2 :38). <br>• The *impression* that God is one singular entity whose name is *Jesus.* | • Does not acknowledge the explicit Trinitarian formula. <br>• The *Greek “name”* is taken to refer only to the human Son, omitting the Father and Spirit. <br>• Many early church documents and councils affirm the Trinitarian view. |\n| “Trinitarian baptism is *invalid*.” | • The Trinitarian formula is a later theological development, not biblically required. | • The only explicit command for baptism is Trinitarian; the New Testament has no prohibition of it. |\n| “Jesus is the *only* name for God; the Father and Spirit are *manifestations* of the One.” | • Based on scripture such as John 1:1 (the Word is God); 1 Cor 1:15, 27 (Christ is the full revelation). | • Orthodox theology holds that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct Persons within the same Divine Essence. |\n\n### How it is seen by mainstream churches\n\n- **Catholic, Orthodox, and most mainline Protestant churches** consider the Trinitarian baptism formula the normative practice and hold that baptism “in Jesus’ name only” is a non‑orthodox, theological position.\n- **Churches that use the Trinitarian formula** view the “in Jesus’ name” usage by Oneness groups as lacking scriptural backing and as ignoring the fuller revelation of God’s nature in the New Testament.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What the Scriptures Teach About Baptism\n\n1. **Command:** “Baptize … *in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit*” – Matthew 28:19.  \n   - *This is the *apostolic directive*.*\n\n2. **Theological Substance:** Baptism is a participation in the *Triune* life of salvation:  \n   - **Father** – the source and sustainer;  \n   - **Son** – the redeemer and medium;  \n   - **Holy Spirit** – the sanctifier and ongoing presence.  \n   - This tri‑aspect is mirrored in the Trinitarian formula.\n\n3. **No scriptural prohibition** against the Trinitarian formula: All instances of baptism in the New Testament that are recorded (*Acts 2:38*, *Acts 8:1‑3*, *Acts 13:9*) are in context addressed to the *Lord* and *Saviour*, not a formula that would invalidate the practice if omitted.  \n\n4. **Historical consistency**: The practice of baptizing “in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit” dates back to the earliest church. No biblical passage declares this practice invalid. \n\n---\n\n## 5. Theological Consequences\n\n| Outcome for the *Trinitarian* approach | Outcome for the *Oneness* approach |\n|---|---|\n| *Validity*: Baptism that follows the Trinitarian formula aligns with the apostolic command. | *Validity*: Baptism in “Jesus’ name” does not contravene any explicit scriptural prohibition, but it is **not the norm** for the broader biblical tradition. |\n| *Doctrine*: Affirms the Triune nature of God per the New Testament, the fullness of God in Jesus, and the unity that the apostle Peter sees in *1 Cor 1:30.* | *Doctrine*: Positions the church as a *non‑Trinitarian* fellowship, implying a different understanding of God's nature than mainstream Christianity. |\n| *Ecclesial practice*: Reflects the unified worship of the church, recognizing all Persons of the Godhead at once. | *Ecclesial practice*: Emphasizes the Person of Jesus.  It may affect liturgy, catechesis, and theological teaching on the nature of God. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Take‑away\n\n- **Scripture teaches one unambiguous baptism formula:** *“in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit”* (Matthew 28:19).  \n- **The use of “in Jesus’ name”** is found in other New‑Testament passages, but those do not override the Trinitarian command; they highlight the Person of the Son as the visible Name of the unified God.  \n- **Orthodox Christianity** therefore sees the Trinitarian formula as the normative, apostolic practice for baptism, integral to the Trinitarian understanding of salvation.  \n- **Oneness‑Pentecostal teaching** rests on a particular interpretation that emphasizes the single name of Jesus.  While not outright *contradicted* by Scripture, it departs from the *Trinitarian directive* and the historic church’s consensus on baptism.  \n\nIt is entirely legitimate—and well‑mannered—to hold different convictions on this point, but the biblical record and the consensus of the early church overwhelmingly support the Trinitarian formula as the standard for valid Christian baptism.",

          "rationale": "The answer correctly identifies Matthew 28:19 as the explicit Trinitarian baptismal formula and notes historical Orthodoxy’s use of that form. However, it distorts several key scriptural passages (notably Acts 8:38‑39 vs. 8:14‑17, Acts 12:10, John 20:23, and 1 Tim 3:16) and makes incorrect claims about what those passages say or imply regarding baptism formulas. It also presents a skewed, sometimes inaccurate view of early Christian practice (e.g., conflating various NT references to 'in the name' with a universal prohibition or validation of a specific formula). While it provides a recognizable oneness vs. Trinitarian framing and an attempt at nuance, the factual/scriptural errors undermine its overall reliability and alignment with historic Christian orthodoxy. A more careful treatment would acknowledge the weight of early baptismal practice both for and against different formulaic understandings, and would quote and interpret each passage accurately in its proper context."
