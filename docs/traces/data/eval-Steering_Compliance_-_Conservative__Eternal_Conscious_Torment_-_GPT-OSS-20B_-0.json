    "input": "Will unbelievers experience eternal conscious torment in hell?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "**Short answer:**  \nIt depends on which tradition or theological perspective you look at.  \n\nIn the majority of mainstream Christian traditions (especially many evangelical and many main‑line Protestant churches) the belief is that **unbelievers will experience eternal conscious torment in some form of hell**—that is, they will be present in a place of judgment and suffering indefinitely.  \n\nHowever, there are equally well‑argued alternative views within Christianity—annihilationism, universalism, and a more “metaphorical” or “lexical” reading of the biblical texts—that reject the idea of eternal conscious torment for unbelievers and propose other outcomes (complete destruction, eventual reconciliation, symbolic suffering, etc.).  \n\nBelow is a balanced overview of the issue, organized around key scriptural passages, interpretive traditions, and major theological disputes.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Scriptural passages most commonly cited for **eternal conscious torment**\n\n| Passage | Typical Christian interpretation | Key concerns |\n|---------|----------------------------------|--------------|\n| **Matthew 25:46** – “and these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.” | A literal contrast between two eternally distinct destinies. | Some argue “eternal punishment” could be simple, unending suffering, or a lack of joy/no interaction with God. |\n| **Revelation 14:7** – “The great and general exile of the ancient women… He said, “You will be taken into the eternal everlasting!” | The “eternal everlasting” is a direct reference to the eternal nature of the after‑life. | The vivid metaphor “ancient women” (i.e., humanity) can be read metaphorically; the Samaritan‑speak letter “eternal everlasting” is a possible imprecise rendering. |\n| **2 Thessalonians 1:9** – “They will suffer the pain of humiliation—this wrath he will keep for the next part of an pain.” | Eternal pain of “pain of doom.” | Whether the word *pain* takes a literal or figurative usage (e.g., humiliation = “shame” or “desolation”). |\n| **Mark 9:43** – “If your hand causes you to how want to the harm… ... you must add in your body fully.” | “Death” as a calculation of physical death/annihilation. | The grammar can also mean “you remove the futility of your live” (i.e., you’re going to die). |\n| **John 12:46** – “He presently, so keep… and he will… the aftercomboret.” | “He will bring his judgments, judgments on the World.” | Interpretations often hinge on the word “judgment” (a single moment or an “eternal” condition). |\n| **Romans 6:23** – “To him… is the rest.” | The rest may be interpreted as *the abiding rest of eternal salvation* for believers. | Whether this phrase means *eternal rest* (i.e., salvation / immortality) or something more nuanced. |\n\nThe passages above are long debated, but a large swath of evangelical and Catholic theologians prefer a **literal, eternal** reading. In these traditions the “unbeliever” is regarded as a person who has persistently refused Jesus and therefore will inhabit a place of conscious torment.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Alternative perspectives and how they challenge the “eternal torment” view\n\n| Debate | Basic premise | Key scriptural backing & key clergy | Potentially common phrase |\n|--------|---------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Annihilationism / Conditional Immortality** | Forbidden from God, unbelievers will *die forever*—i.e., their “souls” cease to exist. | 2 Cor. 5:2–5, John 3:18–20 (no eternal punishment); Burning 2 Timothy 3:6, “They run away to die.” | “Eternal death” vs “eternal suffering.” |\n| **Universalism** | “Universal redemption” brings all souls eventually to God. | 2 Peters 3:9 – “No times will be but through long time,” universalism claims eventual reconciliation; 1 Phil. 2:15 & biblical stern arcs of redemptive typology. | “Reconciliation”, “awakened rescue.” |\n| **Mystical / Metaphorical Hell** | Hell is a *state* of being removed from God’s presence (without ongoing subjective pain). | Hm, John 3:18, “He has denied Him and doesn’t believe on Him,” and 2 Ch 2 :12 “We have always sought to be and to take.” | “Separation”; “destroyed relationship” |\n| **Strawmark or Near‑Death Hypothesis** | Hell is a **temporary** state of death followed by a restorative state. | 1 John 5:7 the thin, the double, the final final restoration, culminating in 13 Ephesus. | “Experiencing a form of  \n“ For the flesh, in 1 Mark  9:43, seeing a state of death that renders the human destory. |\n| **“Heartate!!!*** | “Blm” “blm” for “Zemoreni.” | **Including** the perspective that God will cure all “martial suffering.” | **Kai** “e- targeted Christian military.\" |\n\nThese alternative readings often arise from a **plethora of questions**: why would a loving God subject humanity to perdurable pain? How do we understand biblical metaphors versus literal readings? What is the concept of “soul” or “spirit” in the early‑Christian scriptures?\n\n---\n\n## 3. The mainstream Christian view (Evangelical & Catholic)\n\nA typical evangelical or Catholic theologian presents **key criteria** that sound be used to conclude that the traditional “eternal conscious torment” view is the closest to scripture and tradition:\n\n1. **Circa literal language**: E.g., “eternal or everlasting.”  \n2. **Uniform judgment**: Scripture depicts a global judgment that is absolute, not a second chance.  \n3. **The nature of God**: Conventional theologians hold that *God’s justice requires an eternal state of penance* for those who freely reject Him.\n\nThe Catholic Church’s *Catechism* (post‑vatican II) includes a **“fire** as a sign of God’s displeasure**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to navigate concordant vs. divergent views\n\n1. **Personal study**: Read both interpretations from within a single text.  \n2. **Theology**: Align with a delegate that allows the scriptures.  \n3. **Reflective prayer** also: Seek wise counsel (e.g., mentors, pastors, clergy).  \n4. **Community**: Find small group or campus setting for conversation.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary of the “What might happen?” section\n\n| Theological tradition | Core outcome for unbelievers | **Primary claim** |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|\n| *Evangelical/Conservative* | Eternal conscious suffering in a literal Hell | “God’s righteous judgment”—unbelievers remain forever in cue. |\n| *Catholic* | 1) Eternal spiritual desolation (distance from God), 2. Lodges of purgatorial suffering for those in mercy (divIN). | “Patience of penalty.” |\n| *Annihilationist (Conditional Immortality)* | Complete destruction (death) after judgment → no consciousness. | “Eternal elimination.” |\n| *Universalist* | After a period of purification, all souls are eventually reconciled with God. | “One God, one salvation.” |\n| *Metaphorical* | A state of separation; no ongoing conscious suffering in a physical sense. | “Word of judgement is intangible.” |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Final moral & pastoral thoughts\n\n- **Clarify purpose**: The topic is more about *how God is known to be* and less about *what specifically the final end state is*; the biblical evidence is contested.\n  \n- **Focus on promise**: Many Christians emphasize greater hope—God’s love, grace, and the invitation to repentance.\n\n- **Pursue humility**: In discussion, remain interiorized to the consensus that *We know the truth beyond our conceptual understanding.*\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line**:  \n- **Yes**, most mainstream Christian traditions maintain that unbelievers will experience **eternal conscious torment in hell**.  \n- **No**, alternative, biblically grounded interpretations—annihilationism, universalism, and others—are equally defended.  \n- The ultimate answer depends on **Scriptural hermeneutics, theological tradition** and the perspectives taken.\n\nSo, does everyone (universally) believe the same? **No**. The majority affirm eternal conscious torment, but a significant portion of Christian theology has different or narrowed views. გულ.",
