    "expected": "Christians hold various eschatological views: Premillennialism believes Christ returns before a literal thousand-year reign. Postmillennialism expects Christ returns after the church establishes God's kingdom on earth. Amillennialism sees the millennium as symbolic of the current church age. Within premillennialism, pretribulationists believe the rapture precedes tribulation, while post-tribulationists place it after. Preterists see many prophecies as fulfilled in 70 AD. Despite these differences, all orthodox Christians affirm Christ's personal return, final judgment, bodily resurrection, and eternal states of heaven and hell. The timing and details are disputed, but the core hope remains.",
    "output": "Christian teaching about the end times (eschatology) is diverse, but Christians across traditions share core convictions about the return of Christ, the resurrection, the final judgment, and the creation of a new heaven and new earth. Below is a structured overview that lays out the main positions, with attention to how different traditions think about the same questions.\n\n1) Core, common elements most orthodox Christians affirm\n- Jesus Christ will return in a visible, transformative way.\n- The dead will be raised and all people will stand judgment.\n- God will renew all creation: the final state is heaven and earth made whole (often spoken of as a \"new creation\" or “new heavens and new earth”).\n- The kingdom of God is real both now (present in Christ’s church and Spirit) and not yet fully realized until Christ’s return.\n- The aim of eschatology is to point believers to faithful living now in light of God’s ultimate justice and mercy.\n\n2) Three broad eschatological frameworks (the millennium question)\n- Amillennialism (the “no literal millennium” view)\n  - The thousand-year reign of Christ is symbolic, representing the current church age.\n  - Christ reigns from heaven through the Spirit and the church; there isn’t a future, literal 1000-year reign on earth.\n  - The final things (resurrection, judgment, new creation) occur at the end of history with Christ’s return.\n  - Tribulation is understood as the ongoing conflict between good and evil in the present age, culminating in the final judgment.\n  - Traditional in Catholic, Orthodox, and many Reformed and Lutheran churches.\n- Postmillennialism (the world gradually improves under the gospel)\n  - The gospel will progressively transform society, bringing about a long “millennium” of righteousness before Christ returns.\n  - Christ returns after this era to judge and fully renew all things.\n  - It tends to emphasize the societal influence of the gospel (justice, peace, moral reform) and is less common today, though it has historic roots in some Protestant traditions.\n- Premillennialism (Christ returns before a future earthly millennium)\n  - Christ will return prior to (pre-) a literal 1000-year reign on earth.\n  - There is often a period of tribulation before that return.\n  - In many forms (notably dispensationalism) this includes a separate “rapture” of believers before the tribulation, followed by a second coming with visible reign on earth.\n  - Historic premillennialists usually reject a secret rapture but still expect a future, literal millennium on earth.\n\n3) The “rapture” question (how, when, and who is taken)\n- Pre-tribulational rapture: Many evangelical and dispensational groups teach that believers are taken up to meet Christ before a coming period of tribulation.\n- Mid-trib or post-trib positions: Some hold that believers are taken up during the tribulation or only after it ends, at Christ’s return.\n- Not all traditions emphasize a separate rapture; many amillennial and postmillennial Christians read Revelation and related prophecies as fulfilled in a symbolic or spiritual sense, without a distinct pre-trib rapture event.\n- Across traditions, the crucial point is not the exact timing of extra-biblical speculation, but the confidence that Christ will return and judge the world and that believers live in hopeful, faithful obedience in light of that certainty.\n\n4) Hermeneutical approaches to prophecy (how we read Revelation and Daniel)\n- Futurism: Most prophecies are primarily about events yet to occur, especially in the end times (popular in many evangelical and dispensational circles).\n- Preterism: Most prophecies have already been fulfilled in past events (especially around 70 AD with the destruction of Jerusalem). Partial preterism is common; full preterism (all prophecy fulfilled) is controversial and rejected by major Christian traditions.\n- Idealism (spiritual/metaphysical): Prophecy is primarily about timeless spiritual forces and the cosmic struggle between good and evil, not a strict chronology of future events.\n- Many Catholic, Orthodox, and some mainline Protestant interpreters favor a symbolic or mixed approach, emphasizing the paschal significance of Christ’s victory rather than a precise timetable.\n\n5) Denominational snapshots (how some major traditions tend to frame eschatology)\n- Catholicism\n  - Emphasizes the final things: death, judgment, heaven, hell; the resurrection of the body; and the creation of a new heaven and new earth.\n  - Distinguishes between the visible Second Coming and the immediate afterlife (including purgatory as a process of purification for some).\n  - Generally does not teach a pre-trib rapture; sees the Second Coming as one, public, historical event at the end of the age.\n  - Eschatology is integrated with liturgy, sacramental life, and the church’s teaching authority (magisterium).\n- Eastern Orthodoxy\n  - Emphasizes the unfinalizable mystery of the last things; the kingdom is “already” present in Christ and the church but “not yet” in fullness.\n  - The Second Coming, final judgment, the resurrection, and the renewal of creation are central; no official teaching on a rapture.\n  - Theosis (deification) is a key lens: eschatology is about humanity being perfected in union with God.\n- Protestant mainline (e.g., Lutherans, Reformed, Anglicans, Methodists)\n  - Most are amillennial or postmillennial; many hold to a non-literal or symbolic reading of the millennium.\n  - Emphasize the certainty of Christ’s return, the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment, but interpret prophetic imagery in varied ways.\n  - Rapture concepts are less central in many mainline churches than in some evangelical circles.\n- Evangelical and many Pentecostal/Charismatic churches (including much of American Protestant life)\n  - A wide spectrum: from amillennial and postmillennial to premillennial and dispensational premillennial with a pre-trib rapture.\n  - Dispensational premillennialism is influential here, with a distinct emphasis on Israel’s future role and a relatively literal reading of prophecy.\n  - Emphasis on readiness, evangelism, personal holiness, and the hope of Christ’s imminent return.\n- Adventist (Seventh-day Adventist)\n  - Premillennial, with a distinctive timeline and emphasis on prophetic interpretation (Daniel and Revelation).\n  - Teaches that Christ’s return is imminent; highlights the investigative judgment that began in 1844 as a theological precursor to the second coming.\n- Jehovah’s Witnesses\n  - Nontrinitarian; unique chronology around 1914 and a belief in a literal, visible kingdom established on earth after that time.\n  - Emphasize a future, global reign of Christ and a final judgment, with a strong focus on distinctive interpretations of Revelation and Daniel.\n- Other traditions (e.g., some Anabaptist groups, traditional Anglican/parish churches)\n  - Tend toward a more cautious, pastoral eschatology that emphasizes faithful discipleship, social justice, and hope in Christ’s return without speculative timelines.\n\n6) How to approach eschatology thoughtfully\n- Focus on core affirmations: Christ’s return, the resurrection of the dead, the final judgment, and the renewal of creation.\n- Recognize the difference between:\n  - The “already” of Christ’s reign and the “not yet” of full consummation.\n  - The various hermeneutical methods (futurist, preterist, idealist) and their implications for prediction vs. spiritual interpretation.\n- Appreciate the pastoral and ethical weight: eschatology should motivate holiness, mission, and compassionate justice in the present world.\n- Be transparent about ideas that are speculative or non-essential to faith, and honor honest disagreement as part of theological humility.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor this to a specific tradition (Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican, Baptist, Adventist, etc.) and summarize that tradition’s typical stance, vocabulary, and key scriptural texts. I can also suggest accessible reading lists or brief summaries from official church catechisms or confessions.",

The summary risks presenting their position as a straightforward earthly, post-1914 event rather than their distinctive heavenly/earthly kingdom framework.",

Minor factual ambiguities concern specific doctrinal nuances in Orthodoxy (purgatory) and Jehovah’s Witnesses (the timing/form of the Kingdom) that can be misrepresented if presented as authoritative, universal positions.

It acknowledges that traditions differ on issues like the rapture and the interpretation of Revelation and Daniel, and it emphasizes common core beliefs (return of Christ, resurrection, final judgment, new creation). There is no overt advocacy for a single tradition, and the tone invites ecumenical dialogue and recognizes legitimate diversity.
