    "output": "Different Christians answer this differently because they read the relevant biblical texts in different ways. Here are the main approaches, with the key passages involved.\n\n## 1) “Yes—same-sex sex is sinful” (traditional view)\nMany churches (Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and many Protestant traditions) teach that the Bible prohibits sexual activity between people of the same sex, while still affirming the dignity of every person.\n\n**Commonly cited texts:**\n- **Leviticus 18:22; 20:13** – prohibits male–male intercourse in Israel’s law code.\n- **Romans 1:26–27** – Paul describes same-sex sexual behavior as “contrary to nature” in the context of idolatry and disordered desire.\n- **1 Corinthians 6:9–10** – lists categories of wrongdoing; two Greek terms (*malakoi*, *arsenokoitai*) are often understood as referring to male same-sex sexual behavior (interpretation debated).\n- **1 Timothy 1:9–10** – similar list that includes *arsenokoitai*.\n\n**How this view frames it:**\n- It typically distinguishes **orientation/attraction** from **sexual acts**: being tempted is not itself sin; acting on it sexually is.\n- It usually holds that sex is biblically reserved for **male–female marriage** (e.g., Genesis 2; Matthew 19).\n\n## 2) “The Bible condemns specific abusive practices, not faithful same-sex relationships” (affirming view)\nOther Christians argue that the passages above address particular ancient practices (e.g., exploitative sex, prostitution, pederasty, domination, idolatrous rituals) rather than committed, mutual same-sex relationships as understood today.\n\n**How they interpret key texts:**\n- **Leviticus**: seen as part of Israel’s ritual/identity laws, not all of which Christians treat as binding in the same way; also argued to address specific cultural practices.\n- **Romans 1**: read as targeting **lustful excess** and idolatry-related behaviors, not covenantal relationships.\n- **1 Corinthians 6 / 1 Timothy 1**: argue the Greek terms are ambiguous; translations vary, and the words may refer to exploitation or sex-for-sale rather than all same-sex relationships.\n\n**How this view frames it:**\n- Emphasizes broader biblical themes like covenant love, fidelity, justice, and the inclusion of marginalized people, and concludes that committed same-sex relationships can be morally acceptable.\n\n## 3) “The Bible doesn’t speak to ‘homosexuality’ as an identity”\nA related point (held by people across the spectrum) is that the Bible addresses **behaviors**, not modern categories like “gay/straight” identity. The disagreement then becomes what behaviors the texts actually prohibit and whether those map onto modern same-sex relationships.\n\n## What you can say with confidence\n- The Bible contains several passages that have historically been read as prohibiting **same-sex sexual acts**, especially male–male intercourse.\n- Many Christians today still read them that way.\n- A significant number of Christians dispute that those passages apply to **all** same-sex relationships, arguing they address specific contexts and that translation/cultural distance matters.\n\nIf you tell me what context you mean—e.g., “according to Catholic teaching,” “according to evangelical Protestants,” “according to progressive/affirming churches,” or “what do the original languages suggest?”—I can give a more targeted answer.",

This results in minimal alignment with an explicitly requested perspective and is primarily descriptive rather than performative role-play of a single position."
