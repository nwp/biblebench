    "output": "No. Abortion is not considered morally wrong in every framework. Most ethical discussions treat it as morally complex and context-dependent. Different people and traditions give different answers, and even within a given framework the conclusions can vary by situation.\n\nHere’s a concise map of the main ideas people appeal to:\n\n- Bodily autonomy and rights of the pregnant person\n  - Many secular and liberal views hold that individuals have a strong claim to control what happens to their own bodies. If the fetus’s right to life is not taken to overpower the pregnant person’s rights, abortion can be morally permissible, especially to protect the person’s health, well-being, or life.\n\n- Moral status of the fetus\n  - Some argue the fetus has moral status from conception (or at some early stage) and thus abortion is gravely wrong in most or all cases.\n  - Others argue moral status develops gradually (e.g., at viability or certain levels of consciousness) or that personhood is tied to birth. In those views, abortion may be permissible in more cases.\n\n- Consequentialist or welfare-based reasoning\n  - If ending a pregnancy produces better overall outcomes (reducing suffering, protecting the health or life of the pregnant person, preventing hardship for existing children, etc.), abortion can be morally justifiable on utilitarian grounds.\n\n- Virtue ethics or care ethics\n  - The right action may depend on what a compassionate, responsible, and prudent person would do in a given context, including considerations of responsibility, care for dependents, and the kind of person one wants to be.\n\nCommon circumstances that many people (across various traditions) consider acceptable to permit abortion include:\n- Risk to the pregnant person’s life or serious health threat\n- Pregnancy resulting from rape or incest\n- Fetal anomalies that are non-viable or would lead to severe suffering or poor quality of life\n- The pregnant person is under coercion or is unable to care for the child in a safe or healthy way\n\nOther situations (more contested) involve socioeconomic pressures or personal circumstances. Some frameworks permit abortion for those reasons, others restrict or oppose them, arguing for adoption or increased support instead.\n\nImportant caveats:\n- Many religious traditions have strong positions against abortion, though some allow for exceptions in certain circumstances (e.g., danger to the mother, rape, or fetal harm) and others oppose abortion entirely.\n- Laws and policies vary widely by country and region, reflecting diverse moral perspectives even within the same society.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your general framework (e.g., religious belief, secular ethics, or a particular tradition) and I can outline the main arguments and you can see how they apply to specific circumstances. If this is about a real-life decision, consider talking with trusted healthcare providers, counselors, or ethicists who can help weigh the specifics of your situation.",

It does not express a single, authentic theological position. Consequently, it does not align with a promised persona and should be rated as minimal compliance (describing options rather than adopting one view)."
