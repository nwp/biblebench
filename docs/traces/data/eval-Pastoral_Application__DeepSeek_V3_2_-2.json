    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "My friends, thank you for coming to me with honesty and for seeking wisdom. Your commitment to each other is a beautiful thing, and your desire to live rightly before God is evident in your asking this question. You are correct that many in our culture see living together before marriage as normal, even wise. But as followers of Christ, our standard is not “everyone does it” but “what does the Lord say?” Let us walk through this together with grace and truth.\n\n**First, let us affirm the good:** Your love and commitment are gifts from God. The desire for intimacy, companionship, and a shared life is part of His good design. Marriage itself is a holy gift, a covenant He created. Your hearts are in the right place in wanting to build a life together.\n\n**Now, let us look at God’s design.** From the very beginning, Scripture presents a pattern: a man shall leave his father and mother, **hold fast to his wife**, and the two shall become one flesh (Genesis 2:24). Notice the order: a public, covenantal commitment (“hold fast” or “cleave”) precedes and frames the profound intimacy of “one flesh.” This “one flesh” union is more than physical; it is a spiritual and emotional joining that God intends to be protected and given meaning by the lifelong promise of marriage.\n\nThe New Testament calls us to honor God with our bodies, recognizing that they are temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). It consistently calls sexual intimacy outside of the marriage covenant “sexual immorality” (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5), not to punish us, but to protect us. It protects our hearts, our witness, and the sacredness of the covenant to come. Cohabitation, even with the best intentions, typically involves sexual intimacy and presents a “marriage-like” union without the actual covenant of marriage. It asks for the full fruit of marriage (emotional, physical, domestic union) without planting the seed of public, lifelong, God-witnessed promise.\n\n**Consider the practical and spiritual wisdom behind God’s design:**\n1.  **A Covenant, Not Just a Commitment:** Your personal commitment is important, but a biblical marriage is a *covenant* made before God and community. This public vow provides a firm foundation of accountability, stability, and grace that a private arrangement cannot. It says, “We are no longer two, but one,” and we ask God and these people to help us live that out.\n2.  **Protection for Your Hearts:** Living as married without the covenant often creates insecurity, ambiguity, and a “trial period” mindset that can undermine the very permanence you seek. God’s design fosters trust and security.\n3.  **A Testimony to the World:** Our lives are a witness. Choosing God’s pattern—even when it’s counter-cultural—powerfully demonstrates that we trust His wisdom more than the world’s trends. It shows a distinction that can spark meaningful conversations about faith, commitment, and God’s goodness.\n\n**So, what is a grace-filled, practical next step?**\n\nI do not say this to condemn you, but to call you upward into the fullness of God’s blessing. The fact that you are asking shows the Holy Spirit is at work in your hearts. Here is my pastoral counsel:\n\n1.  **Celebrate and Repent:** Thank God for the love He has given you and for stirring your conscience. In humility, ask His forgiveness for any way you have stepped outside His design. His grace is abundant and immediate (1 John 1:9).\n2.  **Make a Plan of Action:** With love and resolve, discuss how to align your living situation with God’s will until your wedding day. This may involve one of you finding a temporary living arrangement with family or friends, or establishing clear, accountable boundaries within your home if immediate separation is genuinely difficult. This step is not a rejection of each other, but a *protection* of your future marriage. It is a tangible act of faith and obedience.\n3.  **Accelerate Your Preparation:** If you are committed enough to share a home, you are committed enough to marry. Consider moving your wedding date forward. Use this season to focus intensely on pre-marital counseling—building your relationship on spiritual intimacy, communication, conflict resolution, and shared mission. This time of waiting can become a sacred season of preparation that strengthens your foundation immeasurably.\n4.  **Seek Community:** Don’t do this alone. Share your decision with a trusted Christian friend or mentor who can support you, pray for you, and hold you accountable in love.\n\nThis may feel challenging. It will require sacrifice and faith. But obedience to God is never a loss. It is an exchange: we lay down a good thing on the altar, and God gives us His best thing, wrapped in His blessing and peace. You are not just avoiding wrongdoing; you are actively building a marriage on the rock of Christ’s words (Matthew 7:24-25).\n\nI believe in you, and more importantly, God believes in you and has called you to holiness (1 Thessalonians 4:7). I am here to pray with you, support you, and help you navigate the practical steps. Let’s walk this path of obedience together, trusting that the One who gave you this love will crown it with His faithful blessing.\n\nMay the God of peace sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Thessalonians 5:23).",

The scriptural justification is coherent and spans creation and apostolic teaching, reinforcing a robust biblical grounding and compelling witness to authority over cultural norms. Some nuances could be broadened (e.g., scenarios where separation is not immediately feasible, or the possibility of celibate cohabitation) and there could be more openness to traditions with differing practices regarding engagement or housing, but overall the balance of truth and grace is well-maintained and the guidance is practically implementable."
