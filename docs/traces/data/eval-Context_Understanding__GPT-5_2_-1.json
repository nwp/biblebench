    "output": "Before his encounter with the risen Jesus (Acts 9; Gal 1), Paul—then known by his Hebrew name **Saul**—had a well-defined Jewish, social, and religious background:\n\n### 1) Birthplace and cultural setting\n- **From Tarsus in Cilicia** (in modern southern Turkey), a significant Greco-Roman city (Acts 21:39; 22:3).  \n- This likely meant he was **a Diaspora (Hellenistic) Jew**, familiar with Greek language and wider Mediterranean culture, even while remaining strongly committed to Jewish law.\n\n### 2) Jewish identity and pedigree\nPaul describes himself as:\n- **Circumcised on the eighth day**\n- **“Of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin”**\n- **“A Hebrew of Hebrews”** (Phil 3:5)  \nThese phrases emphasize strong ancestral identity and loyalty to Jewish tradition.\n\n### 3) Education and religious party affiliation\n- In Acts, Paul says he was educated in Jerusalem **“at the feet of Gamaliel”** (Acts 22:3), a famous teacher associated with the Pharisaic tradition.  \n- Paul himself calls himself a **Pharisee** (Phil 3:5; cf. Acts 23:6) and says he was **“extremely zealous”** for the traditions of his ancestors (Gal 1:14).\n\n**Scholarly note:** The core picture—Paul as a rigorous, Torah-observant Pharisee—is widely accepted because it is supported by Paul’s own letters (Philippians, Galatians). The specific detail about studying under **Gamaliel** comes from Acts; many scholars consider it plausible, though Acts is a later narrative source and sometimes debated in its precision.\n\n### 4) Roman citizenship and social status\n- Acts portrays Paul as a **Roman citizen by birth** (Acts 22:25–28), a status that later affects his legal dealings and travel.  \n**Scholarly note:** This citizenship claim is commonly accepted as historically possible and fits some features of his career, though it is reported explicitly in Acts rather than in Paul’s letters.\n\n### 5) Occupation/trade\n- Paul worked with his hands; Acts identifies him with **tentmaking/leatherworking** (Acts 18:3).  \n- His letters confirm he supported himself by manual labor at times (e.g., 1 Thess 2:9; 1 Cor 4:12).\n\n### 6) Zealous opponent of the early Jesus movement\nBefore his conversion, Paul was an active persecutor:\n- He says he **persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it** (Gal 1:13; cf. Phil 3:6; 1 Cor 15:9).\n- Acts depicts him as approving of Stephen’s death and participating in arrests (Acts 7:58–8:3; 9:1–2).\n\n### In summary\nPaul’s pre-conversion life was marked by **strong Jewish identity**, **Pharisaic training**, **zeal for the law and ancestral traditions**, and **active persecution of the early Christian movement**, alongside a background shaped by **Diaspora Judaism** (Tarsus), a **manual trade**, and (according to Acts) **Roman citizenship**.",

It also notes the Acts-vs-Pauline-letter nuance and the procedural caution that Acts provides a narrative source (especially regarding Gamaliel) while Paul’s own letters corroborate key elements. The major caveat is a minor imprecision regarding the exact craft (tentmaking vs leatherworking); the overall factual content remains solid."
