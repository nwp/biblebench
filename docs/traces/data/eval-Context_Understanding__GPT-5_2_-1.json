Each claim has biblical support (Acts 22:3; 25; 23:6; Galatians 1:13–14; Philippians 3:5–6; Romans 11:1). The statement captures the key nuance that his zeal was for the Law and that he persecuted Christians before his conversion. There are no doctrinal errors and no significant missing nuance given the question’s scope."
