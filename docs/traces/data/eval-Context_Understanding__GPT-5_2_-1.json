          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately reflects Paul's pre-conversion background per scholarly biblical evidence. Key facts are correct: Paul is identified as from the tribe of Benjamin (Philippians 3:5), born in Tarsus (Acts 21:39; 22:3), a Roman citizen (Acts 22:25–29; 28), and a Hebrew of Hebrews who was trained in Jerusalem under Gamaliel (Acts 22:3; Galatians 1:14; Philippians 3:5–6). It correctly characterizes him as a Pharisee (Acts 23:6; Philippians 3:5) and as zealously persecuting the early Christian movement (Acts 7–8; Galatians 1:13; 1 Corinthians 15:9; Philippians 3:6). The answer also notes his ability to navigate both Jewish and Roman spheres due to diaspora background and citizenship, which aligns with scholarly readings. While the core expected answer is succinct (“Pharisee and persecutor”), the LLM’s broader account remains factually accurate and is appropriately nuanced, citing relevant biblical passages for claims and acknowledging areas of explicit textual naming (e.g., Gamaliel) versus what is named in Paul’s own letters. No factual errors or major omissions are present."
