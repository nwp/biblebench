    "expected": "This is not consistent with orthodox Christianity. This LDS teaching suggests that God the Father was once a human who progressed to godhood, and that humans can become gods themselves. This represents polytheism and contradicts the biblical teaching that God is eternally God, unchanging (Malachi 3:6), and that there is only one true God (Isaiah 43:10, 44:6). Orthodox Christianity teaches monotheism - there is one eternal, uncreated God who has always been God, and the gap between Creator and creation is absolute. Humans can be transformed into Christ's likeness but never become deity.",
    "output": "### Analysis of the LDS Teaching: \"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become\"\n\nThis statement, popularized by Lorenzo Snow (fifth president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or LDS Church) in the 19th century, encapsulates a core element of LDS doctrine known as **eternal progression** or **exaltation**. It suggests a trajectory where human beings, through faithfulness, ordinances, and divine grace, can advance to godhood, while implying that God the Father Himself once existed as a mortal man who progressed to divinity. This teaching draws from LDS scriptures like the *Doctrine and Covenants* (e.g., D&C 132:19–20) and teachings of Joseph Smith, such as the *King Follett Discourse* (1844), which describe God as an exalted man from a pre-mortal state in a prior world.\n\nTo assess its consistency with **orthodox Christian theology**—defined here as the historic, creedal faith of Trinitarian Christianity (e.g., Nicene Creed of 325/381 AD, Chalcedonian Definition of 451 AD, and the consensus of Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant traditions)—we must examine key doctrines: the nature of God (theology proper) and the destiny of humanity (soteriology/anthropology). Orthodox Christianity is rooted in Scripture (e.g., the 66-book Protestant canon or 73-book Catholic/Orthodox canon), early church fathers, and ecumenical councils.\n\n#### 1. **Orthodox Christian View of God: Eternal, Uncreated, and Immutable**\n   - **Core Affirmation**: God is the singular, eternal Creator *ex nihilo* (out of nothing), with no origin, progression, or predecessor. He is unchanging in His essence (immutability) and exists as Trinity: one God in three co-eternal, co-equal Persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit).\n     - **Scriptural Basis**:\n       - Isaiah 43:10: \"You are my witnesses... and my servant whom I have chosen, that you may know and believe me and understand that **I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me**.\"\n       - Isaiah 44:6: \"Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: 'I am the first and I am the last; **besides me there is no god**.'\"\n       - Psalm 90:2: \"Before the mountains were brought forth... **from everlasting to everlasting you are God**.\"\n       - Malachi 3:6: \"For **I the Lord do not change**.\"\n     - **Creedal Expression**: The Nicene Creed states God the Father is \"Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things, visible and invisible,\" with the Son \"begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father.\"\n   - **Relation to LDS Teaching**: The phrase \"God once was\" as a man radically departs from this. It posits God as having a temporal beginning and evolutionary progression, akin to a \"head god\" in a chain of deities (per LDS sources like the *Pearl of Great Price*, Moses 1:33–39, which mentions \"worlds without number\" created by God's children). Orthodox theology views this as polytheistic or henotheistic, contradicting monotheism (Deut. 6:4: \"The Lord our God, the Lord is one\"). No area of agreement here—it's a fundamental divergence.\n\n#### 2. **Orthodox Christian View of Human Destiny: Redemption and Communion, Not Ontological Deification**\n   - **Core Affirmation**: Humans are created in God's image (Gen. 1:26–27) but finite creatures, fallen in sin, redeemed by Christ's atoning work. Salvation culminates in glorification: eternal life in perfect holiness, intimacy with God, and participation in His divine energies (Eastern Orthodox *theosis*), but **never becoming God by nature** or equals to Him. We remain eternally distinct as creatures.\n     - **Scriptural Basis**:\n       - Romans 8:16–17: Believers are \"children of God\" and \"heirs with Christ,\" sharing in glory as adopted sons/daughters, not as divine rivals.\n       - 2 Peter 1:4: We become \"partakers of the divine nature\" through moral transformation and union with Christ, escaping corruption—not absorbing God's essence.\n       - John 17:3: Eternal life is \"that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent\"—relational knowledge, not identity.\n       - 1 John 3:2: \"We shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is\"—likeness in character (holiness), not essence (divinity).\n     - **Creedal/Historical Nuance**: Theosis (deification) in Eastern Orthodoxy (e.g., Athanasius: \"God became man so that man might become god\") means union without mixture—created beings participate in uncreated divine life (per Gregory Palamas). Western traditions emphasize beatific vision and eternal reward. No tradition teaches humans becoming \"gods\" who create worlds or have spirit offspring.\n   - **Relation to LDS Teaching**: \"Man may become [as God now is]\" aligns superficially with theosis language (moral/spiritual likeness to God), but departs ontologically. LDS exaltation means literal godhood: ruling planets, procreating spirit children, and entering a divine hierarchy (D&C 131:1–4; 132:19–20). Orthodox Christianity rejects this as blurring Creator-creature distinction, risking idolatry (Exodus 20:3–5). Partial agreement exists in aspiring to godliness (e.g., Matt. 5:48: \"Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect\"), but the mechanism and endpoint differ.\n\n#### Conclusion: Inconsistent with Orthodox Christian Theology\nNo, this teaching is **not consistent** with orthodox Christianity. It represents a significant departure in two ways:\n- **On God's Nature**: It introduces a finite, progressed deity, undermining biblical monotheism and divine eternity.\n- **On Human Potential**: While both traditions exalt human dignity and transformation, LDS doctrine elevates it to full deification, which orthodoxy sees as exceeding scriptural bounds and historic creeds.\n\nThis LDS belief is internally coherent within its restorationist framework (emphasizing ongoing revelation), and it's held sincerely by millions as empowering and hopeful. However, from an orthodox Christian perspective, it aligns more with ancient heresies like Arianism (subordinating God) or modern process theologies than with Nicene Trinitarianism. Orthodox believers might respond charitably by affirming shared emphases on Christ's atonement and moral growth while upholding the Creator-creature divide (e.g., via dialogue on John 1:1–14). For deeper reading, compare the Nicene Creed with LDS *Articles of Faith* #1.",

          "rationale": "The answer overall correctly states orthodox Christianity teaches a monotheistic, immutable God and that humans are transformed into Christlikeness rather than becoming deities in a literal sense. It correctly highlights the theological distinction between orthodox theosis and LDS exaltation. The main improvement areas are precise sourcing (distinguishing canonical biblical texts from LDS non-canonical sources) and a carefully nuanced discussion of how LDS theology is often framed in polemical terms (rather than flatly labeling it polytheism). With those refinements, the assessment would be even more accurate and helpful."
