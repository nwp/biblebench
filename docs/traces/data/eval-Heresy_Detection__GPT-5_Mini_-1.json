    "expected": "This is heretical modalism (also called Sabellianism). It denies the distinctness of the three persons of the Trinity. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct persons who exist simultaneously and eternally, not one person appearing in different modes. The baptism of Jesus shows this distinctness: the Son is baptized, the Spirit descends, and the Father speaks - all at the same time.",
    "output": "Verdict: Heresy (modalism / Sabellianism). It is not orthodox Christian teaching.\n\nWhy:\n- What the claim says. The view that “Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are just different modes or roles that the one God takes on at different times” is classic modalism (sometimes called Patripassianism or, in modern forms, Oneness theology). It denies real, personal distinction among the three Persons of the Godhead and treats the Trinity as one person wearing different “masks.”\n\n- What orthodox Christianity teaches. Historic Christian orthodoxy (as summarized in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan and Athanasian creeds) affirms one God (monotheism) who exists eternally as three distinct Persons — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — who share one divine essence. The Persons are distinct in relation and personhood (the Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Spirit), yet they are one God, co-equal and co-eternal. This preserves monotheism without collapsing the persons into one.\n\n- Biblical reasons modalism fails:\n  - Scripture presents simultaneous, personal distinctions: at Jesus’ baptism, the Son is baptized, the Spirit descends, and the Father speaks (Matt 3:16–17). These are not successive “modes” but concurrent, relational acts.\n  - Jesus prays to the Father and speaks of the Father as distinct (e.g. John 17), and the Father sends the Spirit (John 14–16). Eternal relational language (e.g. the Father and the Son in John 1; the Spirit “proceeds” in John 15–16) presupposes real distinction, not mere masks.\n  - Trinitarian formulas and blessings (e.g. 2 Cor 13:14) treat all three as distinct agents.\n- Theological problems with modalism:\n  - It undermines the doctrine of the Incarnation and the inter-Trinitarian relations: if the Father, Son, and Spirit are one and the same person sequentially, how can the Son pray to the Father, be sent by the Father, or be loved by the Father? Modalism makes those relational actions either illusory or nonsensical.\n  - It collapses persons into a single consciousness, conflicting with biblical testimony of relational love within the Godhead and with salvation aspects that depend on distinct persons (e.g., the Son’s obedient sacrifice, the Father’s sending, the Spirit’s application and intercession).\n- Historical decision. Modalism was rejected by the early church (3rd–4th centuries). The church fathers (e.g. Tertullian) and later the Nicene and Constantinopolitan formulations defined the Trinity against modalistic readings and established orthodox terminology (homoousios — of one essence).\n\nPractical note: Modalism often arises from a desire to protect monotheism. The orthodox solution keeps monotheism while also acknowledging real, eternal personal distinctions in God. Helpful resources: the Nicene Creed, Augustine’s On the Trinity, and summaries in standard systematic theologies.\n\nShort summary: Calling the Father, Son, and Spirit merely “modes” is a heresy because it denies the real, personal distinctions that Scripture and the historic church affirm within the one divine being.",

          "rationale": "The LLM’s response accurately identifies modalism (Sabellianism/Oneness theology) as heretical and presents orthodox Trinitarian belief: one God in three eternally distinct persons (Father, Son, Spirit) sharing one divine essence, co-equal and co-eternal. It correctly notes biblical support for real personal distinctions (e.g., Matt 3:16–17; John 17; John 14–16; John 1; 2 Cor 13:14) and the simultaneity of Father, Son, and Spirit in biblical scenes like Jesus’ baptism. It also recounts the historical rejection of modalism by the early church and its development in creeds (Nicene/Constantinopolitan) and authorities like Tertullian. The response acknowledges potential relational nuances (perichoresis, unity-in-diversity) and avoids conflating ontological unity with modal identity. Overall, it is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded, and nuanced. Minor enhancements could include explicit mention of perichoresis as the lived unity of the Persons, but this does not constitute an error."
