    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "The doctrine of the **resurrection of the body** is a central pillar of Christian eschatology (the study of last things). It asserts that at the end of the age, God will raise the physical bodies of the dead to be reunited with their souls, transforming them into an eternal state.\n\nAs a systematic theologian would approach it, this doctrine can be understood through four primary lenses: its biblical foundation, its Christological model, its nature, and its theological implications.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Biblical Foundation\nThe resurrection of the body is not merely an \"add-on\" to the immortality of the soul; it is the climax of the biblical narrative of redemption.\n\n*   **Old Testament Roots:** While less explicit than the New Testament, the hope of bodily restoration appears in Job (“in my flesh I shall see God,” Job 19:26), Isaiah (26:19), and most clearly in Daniel 12:2: \"And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake.\"\n*   **The Apostles' Creed:** The historic Church codified this belief in its earliest creeds, affirming \"the resurrection of the body\" (Latin: *carnis resurrectionem*, literally \"resurrection of the flesh\") to distinguish it from the Greek philosophical idea of a disembodied soul.\n*   **The Teaching of Jesus:** Jesus explicitly taught that \"all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out\" (John 5:28–29).\n\n### 2. Christ as the \"Firstfruits\"\nThe Christian understanding of the resurrection is grounded in the historical event of Jesus Christ’s own resurrection. \n\nThe Apostle Paul calls Christ the \"firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep\" (1 Corinthians 15:20). In Jewish agriculture, the \"firstfruits\" were the first portion of the harvest that guaranteed the rest of the crop would follow. Therefore, our resurrection is not a different *kind* of event than Christ’s; it is the extension of His victory over death to the rest of humanity. Because He rose bodily, showing His wounds and eating food (Luke 24:39-43), we believe our future existence will be tangible and physical, not ghostly.\n\n### 3. The Nature of the Resurrected Body\nThe most detailed systematic treatment of the \"resurrected body\" is found in **1 Corinthians 15**. Paul uses the analogy of a seed: the seed is buried, but it emerges as something far more glorious, yet still fundamentally linked to the original seed.\n\nPaul describes four \"transformations\" that occur between the earthly body and the resurrected body (1 Cor 15:42–44):\n1.  **From Perishable to Imperishable:** The body will no longer be subject to decay, disease, or aging.\n2.  **From Dishonor to Glory:** The body is freed from the shame of sin and the effects of the Fall.\n3.  **From Weakness to Power:** The body will possess a vitality and capability that transcends our current biological limitations.\n4.  **From Natural to Spiritual:** This is often misunderstood. A \"spiritual body\" (*soma pneumatikon*) does not mean a body made of \"spirit\" (like air). It means a body perfectly animated and directed by the Holy Spirit, rather than by fallen human appetites (*psyche*).\n\n### 4. Systematic Distinctions\n\n**A. Continuity and Discontinuity**\nSystematic theology emphasizes that there is **continuity** (it is *your* body, not a brand-new avatar) and **discontinuity** (it is *transformed* and glorified). You remain you, but you are the \"perfected\" version of the biological self.\n\n**B. The Universal Resurrection**\nOrthodox Christian theology teaches a \"general resurrection.\" Both the righteous and the unrighteous will be raised. For the believer, it is a resurrection to eternal life; for the unbeliever, it is a resurrection to judgment (Acts 24:15; Revelation 20:11–15).\n\n**C. The Intermediate State**\nTheologians distinguish the resurrection from the \"intermediate state.\" When a believer dies now, their soul is \"away from the body and at home with the Lord\" (2 Corinthians 5:8). This is a state of conscious bliss, but it is *incomplete*. The final goal of Christianity is not \"going to heaven\" as a disembodied spirit, but the \"New Heavens and New Earth\" where we live in restored, physical bodies.\n\n### 5. Theological Implications\n*   **The Goodness of Creation:** This doctrine refutes Gnosticism (the idea that matter is evil). If God intends to resurrect the body, then the physical world is inherently good and worth redeeming.\n*   **Total Redemption:** Salvation is not just for the \"soul.\" Christ’s redemption is holistic; He saves the whole person—mind, soul, and body.\n*   **Hope in Suffering:** The resurrection provides a unique comfort for those who experience disability, chronic pain, or the degradation of old age. It promises that these conditions are temporary and that physical wholeness is the believer's ultimate destiny.\n\n### Summary\nThe resurrection of the body is the \"Amen\" to God’s creative work. It affirms that death is an \"enemy\" to be defeated (1 Cor 15:26), not a door to a purely spiritual realm. In the resurrection, God does not scrap His original design for humanity; He perfects it, ensuring that we will worship Him eternally as whole, embodied persons.",

            "The claim that the Apostles' Creed explicitly codified the 'resurrection of the body' is not uniformly precise across traditions. Some translations/versions render it as the 'rescuerrection of the dead' or 'the resurrection of the flesh' (carnis resurrectionem in Latin), which is close but not uniformly phrased as 'the resurrection of the body' in all early formularies.",
            "The treatment of the intermediate state could acknowledge that there is substantial variation among historic Christian traditions about the nature of consciousness between death and the final resurrection (some traditions affirm immediate, conscious presence with the Lord; others emphasize a more extended waiting). The answer treats the intermediate state as largely uniform, which is a nuanced debate rather than a settled point.",
            "The explanation of soma pneumatikon (spiritual body) versus soma psychikon (natural/soulish body) is broadly accurate—but the quick summary that 'spiritual' means 'animated by the Holy Spirit rather than by fallen appetites' could oversimplify Pauline usage. The contrast is primarily about agency and order under the Spirit, not merely appetite elimination; some scholarly readings stress continuity of personal identity and freedom from sin rather than a simple appetite metaphor."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the LLM response is strong. It presents a coherent, biblically anchored account of the resurrection of the body, emphasizes bodily continuity with transformation, and situates the doctrine within classical Christian eschatology (Christ as Firstfruits, 1 Corinthians 15, the general resurrection, the intermediate state, and the New Heavens/New Earth). It correctly ties the doctrine to scriptural texts (Job 19:26; Dan 12:2; John 5:28–29; 1 Cor 15; Luke 24:39–43; 2 Cor 5:8) and to orthodox motifs (anti-Gnosticism, holistic redemption). It also notes important distinctions between continuity and transformation, and between the intermediate state and the final resurrection. The main gaps are relatively minor and relate to nuanced philology and terminology (Apostles’ Creed wording; nuanced strand about the intermediate state; a slightly simplified briefing on pneumatikos vs psychikos). Addressing these would enhance precision, but they do not undermine the core doctrinal accuracy."

          "explanation": "The response presents a robust, orthodox account of the resurrection of the body, consistent with historic Christian teaching. Key points align with Scripture and classic doctrine: bodily resurrection as the culmination of redemption (Job 19:26; Dan 12:2; John 5:28–29), Christ as the firstfruits (1 Cor 15:20), the fourfold transformation of the resurrected body (1 Cor 15:42–44), continuity and transformation of the self, the general resurrection with final judgment (Acts 24:15; Rev 20:11–15), and the final goal of the New Heavens and New Earth rather than a merely disembodied heavenly existence. It also rightly guards against Gnostic dualism by affirming the goodness of creation and the materiality of the future life, and it emphasizes the intermediate state while maintaining the eschatological hope of bodily restoration. \n\nSome minor nuanced points worth noting:\n- The exact creedal/formulation language varies historically (the phrase “resurrection of the body” or “carnis resurrectionem” appears in various confessional formulations). The claim that creeds codified this belief is broadly accurate, but exact wording can differ across traditions.\n- The interpretation of 1 Corinthians 15:44–46 (the “spiritual body”) is a debated area: the author’s clarification that “spiritual” refers to being animated and directed by the Spirit rather than non-material aligns with orthodox readings, but some theologians nuance the nature of the resurrected body in ways that could be elaborated (e.g., how material continuity is maintained with glorified transformation).\n- The section on the intermediate state reflects a common Protestant/Catholic/Orthodox consensus, yet not all traditions agree on the precise nature or timing of consciousness between death and the final resurrection (some hold to differing views on soul sleep or immediate immersion in heavenly glory).\n\nOverall, there are no heretical teachings in the piece; it constitutes a sound, high-level synthesis of biblical and historical orthodoxy on the resurrection of the body."
