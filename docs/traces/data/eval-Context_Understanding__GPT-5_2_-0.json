          "rationale": "The response accurately describes the traditional attribution of the Gospel of John to John the son of Zebedee and its characterization as ‘the disciple whom Jesus loved.’ It also correctly notes the strong scholarly view that the gospel was likely written within a Johannine circle or community rather than by a single named author, and that the text itself does not name its author. It cites early patristic testimony (Irenaeus drawing on Polycarp) and acknowledges the ongoing debate between tradition and modern scholarship. It also correctly identifies the ‘beloved disciple’ as the gospel’s claimed source of testimony, with John 21:24 often read in light of this tradition. The answer is balanced, referencing both traditional claims and scholarly uncertainty without overcommitting. A minor enhancement could add dating (c. late 1st to early 2nd century) for additional context, but the essential facts are accurately conveyed."
