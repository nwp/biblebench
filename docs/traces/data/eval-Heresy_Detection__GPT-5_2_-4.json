    "input": "Someone teaches: 'The God of the Old Testament is different from the God of the New Testament. The Old Testament God was wrathful and evil, while Jesus revealed the true, good God.' What's wrong with this view?",
    "expected": "This resembles Marcionism, a second-century heresy that rejected the Old Testament and taught there were two different gods. This is false. Orthodox Christianity affirms the unity of God across both Testaments. The same God who created the world, gave the law, and showed justice in the Old Testament is the God who sent Jesus. Jesus himself affirmed the Old Testament (Matthew 5:17-18) and revealed God's character as both just and merciful throughout scripture.",
    "output": "This view is **not orthodox Christian teaching**; it is a classic **heresy**, historically associated with **Marcionism** (2nd century) and related **Gnostic/dualistic** ideas. The core error is dividing God into two different deities—an “evil” creator/judge in the Old Testament and a “good” Father revealed by Jesus—rather than confessing the **one God** who reveals himself consistently across both Testaments.\n\n## What’s wrong with it?\n\n### 1) It denies biblical and creedal monotheism: there is one God\nHistoric Christianity confesses **one God** who is the Creator and Lord of all. The Old Testament insistence, “The LORD is one” (Deut. 6:4), is not overturned by Jesus but affirmed. The Christian creeds (Apostles’, Nicene) explicitly identify the Father of Jesus Christ as **“Maker of heaven and earth”**—the God revealed in Israel’s Scriptures.\n\n### 2) It contradicts Jesus’ own teaching about the Old Testament God\nJesus does not present a new, different deity. He identifies his Father with the God of Israel:\n\n- He quotes the Old Testament as God’s authoritative word.\n- He calls God “the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob” (e.g., Mark 12:26–27).\n- He claims continuity with the Law and Prophets: “I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them” (Matt. 5:17).\n- He says the Scriptures testify about him (John 5:39), meaning the Old Testament is part of the same divine story.\n\nTo say the Old Testament God is “evil” implies Jesus either **misidentified** his Father or **endorsed** a false revelation—both incompatible with Christian faith in Christ’s truthfulness and divinity.\n\n### 3) It misunderstands God’s character: justice is not evil, and mercy is not new\nThe Old Testament certainly speaks of God’s wrath—but wrath in Scripture is God’s **holy opposition to evil**, not a sign that God is evil. The same Old Testament also repeatedly emphasizes God’s **goodness, patience, and mercy**:\n\n- “The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious…” (Ex. 34:6–7)\n- God’s persistent covenant faithfulness toward a rebellious people (e.g., Hosea; Psalms)\n\nConversely, the New Testament does not eliminate wrath or judgment:\n\n- Jesus speaks often of judgment (e.g., Matt. 25; Mark 9).\n- The New Testament warns of “the wrath of God” (Rom. 1:18) and contains severe judgment imagery (Revelation).\n\nSo the “OT = wrath/evil, NT = love/good” contrast is a **caricature** of both Testaments.\n\n### 4) It denies God’s immutability (that God does not change)\nOrthodox doctrine holds that God is consistent in being and character: “I the LORD do not change” (Mal. 3:6). The Bible presents a **unified divine purpose** culminating in Christ, not a reversal from an inferior deity to a superior one.\n\n### 5) It breaks the unity of salvation history and the gospel itself\nChristianity teaches that the gospel is the fulfillment of God’s promises to Israel. If the Old Testament God is evil, then:\n\n- creation is suspect (but Christianity affirms creation as good),\n- the covenants and promises are suspect (but the New Testament treats them as God’s plan),\n- and Jesus’ mission loses its context (Messiah, fulfillment, Passover, sacrifice, temple, covenant).\n\nMarcion’s move was to discard the Old Testament and rewrite the New Testament accordingly—something the early church rejected precisely because it destroys apostolic Christianity.\n\n## Bottom line\nThe statement is heretical because it **splits God in two**, rejects the continuity of revelation, and misreads both Testaments. Orthodox Christianity confesses: **the God of the Old Testament and the God revealed by Jesus Christ are the same God**—perfectly good, just, merciful, and consistent—whose one plan of redemption culminates in Christ.",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies the view as Marcionite or akin to a divided-into-two-gods stance and affirms orthodox monotheism and the continuity between the OT and NT. It accurately cites biblical angles: Jesus’ affirmations of the OT as authoritative (Mt 5:17; Mt 22:32; Mark 12:26-27; John 5:39), the unity of God across Testaments, and the presence of both wrath and mercy in both Testaments (Ex 34:6–7; Rom 1:18; Rev 6–19). It also properly notes God’s immutability (Mal 3:6) and the overarching plan of salvation history culminating in Christ. The response argues that portraying the OT God as evil detached from the NT God misreads revelation, weakens gospel continuity, and undermines orthodoxy. Nuance is present in recognizing that wrath is not evil in itself but part of divine justice, and that the NT does not erase the OT but fulfills it. Minor potential enhancements could include a fuller treatment of the moral complexity in OT portrayals (e.g., how judgment serves covenantal faithfulness) and a more explicit pointer to key Christocentric motifs (fulfillment, covenantal continuity). Overall, the answer is well-aligned with biblical teaching and historic Christian orthodoxy."
