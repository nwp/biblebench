    "expected": "Christian traditions differ significantly on baptism: Catholics, Orthodox, Lutherans, and some others practice infant baptism, viewing it as a means of grace that initiates covenant membership. Baptists and many evangelicals practice believer's baptism only, requiring a personal profession of faith. Methods differ too: immersion (most Baptists), sprinkling (many Presbyterians), or pouring (some traditions). Some view baptism as essential for salvation (some Churches of Christ), while others see it as an important ordinance but not salvific (many evangelicals). Despite differences, most Christians affirm baptism's importance as commanded by Christ.",
    "output": "**A Brief, Respectful Overview of Baptismal Views Across Christian Traditions**\n\nBaptism lies at the heart of Christian worship and identity. While all Christian communities affirm that the baptizing act is a public declaration of faith, “what it looks like in practice, how it is explained theologically, and when it is given” differ across traditions. Below is a survey that highlights those differences while respecting the shared commitment many Christians have to an essential, “Trinitarian” baptism in truth and grace. (Where possible, scriptural references are provided to show the textual grounding of each view.)\n\n| Tradition | Who is baptized? | When and why? | Mode of baptism | Key theological emphasis | Scriptural basis |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| **Roman Catholic Church** | Adults and *children* (infants) | An adult who has confirmed faith; an infant in the church’s “incorporation” ritual | **Infusion** (water poured over the head), but immersion is also accepted in missionary contexts | Baptism is a sacrament—once‑for‑ever, purifying the soul, bestowing the *gift of the Holy Ghost* and *inserting the baptized into the covenant of Christ*. *It is essential for salvation*, but the Church acknowledges the possibility of “God‑alone” salvations. | Matthew 28:19 – 21; Acts 2:38; John 3:5; 1 Cor 3:16 |\n| **Eastern Orthodox Church** | Adults and infants | Same as Catholic, with strong emphasis on “incorporation” into the church body | **Infusion** (water poured and poured again) | Baptism is a *sacrament of rebirth*, a profound *spiritual transformation* and *entry into the Mysteries*. It *restores the soul’s original holiness* through the Trinitarian action. | Same as Catholic; also 1 Cor 12:13; 1 Pet 3:21 |\n| **Anglican‑Episcopal** | Adults and infants | As above, but a wide range of *liturgical expressions* (affusion, immersion, sprinkling) | **All three modes** are theologically permissible. | Baptism is a *covenant sign*, a *call to holy life*, and a *participation in the Christ‑body*. Trinitarian, sacramental theology; infant baptism is an *affirmation of its continuation in the church*. | Luke 3:13‑22; 1 Cor 12:3 |\n| **Lutheran (Reformed‑Lutheran)** | Adults and infants | Adults who profess faith; infants in “incorporation” via signs of covenant | **Infusion** (with water) traditionally; many Lutherans practice immersion or affusion; all accepted | Baptism is *a covenant sign* and a *means of grace*: *“One dying, one rising”* (election and salvation). God’s promise is put into *action* through water. | Romans 6:3‑4; 2 Cor 5:17 |\n| **Reformed / Calvinist** | Adults and infants | Adults who subjectively confess faith; infants are baptized by the *church covenant* | **All three modes** are acceptable; emphasis on the *symbolic nature* of the act | Baptism is a *sign of covenant*, indicating *lawful participation* and *spiritual union with Christ*. It *presages* the believer’s future profession of faith. | Gal 3:26‑30; 2 Cor 6:14‑18 |\n| **Methodist / United Methodist** | Adults, often older than 12; infants in special contexts | Adults at age ~15–18 who can articulate faith; infants are baptized by *prayerful injection or affusion* | **Affusion or child baptism**; immersion primarily for older saints | Baptism is a *sanctifying ordinance*, a *prelude to sanctification*. Infant baptism is often seen as *promises of grace* awaiting future personal faith. | Acts 2:38; Romans 6:4 |\n| **Baptist (including Southern Baptist)** | Adults/older children who *confess belief* | Only those capable of a public profession of faith (typically 12+ or adult) | **Immersion** only (the “whole‑body” of water). | Emphasis on the *law of men* and *individual responsibility*. Baptism is *symbolic of death to sin and birth to Christ*, after a conscious confession. | Matthew 28:19‑20; Acts 2:38; Romans 6:4 |\n| **Pentecostal / Holiness** | Adults only, faith declaration | Only those who can personally testify | **Immersion** (but affusion and sprinkling are sometimes used in churches with limited water)** | Baptism is a *public testimony* and point of *victory over sin*. Many emphasize water’s symbolic function; some see it as a *second blessing* (post‑conversion). | Acts 2:38‑41; 1 Cor 12:3 |\n| **Adventist (Seventh‑Day)** | Adults who have tested faith | Baptism at the *point of faith confirmation* | **Immersion** | Baptism is a *sign of new life* and a *responsibility to evangelize*. It is “outside the command” (cf. Acts 2:38) and has no sacramental status. | Matthew 28:18‑20; Acts 2:38 |\n| **Non‑Denominational Evangelical** | Adults and adolescents | Baptism after a personal confession of faith, sometimes at any age | **Immersion** (though some use sprinkling) | Baptism is a *public profession* and a *biblical model* per the Great Commission. | Acts 2:38; Romans 6:4; Gal 3:27 |\n| **Jehovah’s Witnesses** | Ages 18+ who can test faith | After a life‑long study of the Bible, a person’s decision to *serve God* | **Sprinkling** (7‑drops on the chest) | Baptism is a *symbolic act* of allegiance to God, not a sacrament of grace. | Revelation 14:6‑7; 1 Cor 12:3 |\n| **Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ)** | Adults, sometimes pre‑teen when proven ready | After studying the *Tenets* and *Visible Commandments* | **Away‑off (sprinkling or affusion)** | Baptism is *service to the church* and the *“only” baptisman* of God. | 1 Cor 12:3 |\n| **Non‑Trinitarian Churches (e.g., Christadelphian, Q‑theist)** | Adults – older children | A person who has truly accepted Christ | **Sprinkling or immersion depending on tradition** | Baptism is a *biblical act of obedience* but not a *means of grace*. | Acts 2:38; Romans 6:4 |\n\n---\n\n### Common Core Themes\n\n1. **Trinitarianism**  \n   The vast majority of churches insist that baptism uses the formula: *“in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”* This is seen by most as a biblical and theological requirement even when the practice varies (e.g., immersion vs. sprinkling).\n\n2. **Christ‑Centricity**  \n   All churches see baptism in relation to Jesus—whether as a *union with His life, death, and resurrection* (Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican), or simply as a *public profession* of faith (Baptists, many Evangelicals).\n\n3. **Covenant Connection**  \n   Historical churches (Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, Reformed) treat baptism as part of the covenantal theology of the scriptures—an *entry* into the people of God.\n\n4. **Means of Grace vs. Ordinance**  \n   - **Sacramental** traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, some Lutherans) consider baptism a way God *acts* in a person, transforming the soul.  \n   - **Ordinary/Incidental** traditions (Baptists, many Evangelicals, Adventists) view it more as a *symbolic act* and a sign of God's promise, not a source of grace in itself.\n\n5. **Infant vs. Believer Baptism**  \n   The debate revolves around how we interpret *covenant theology*, *faith*, and *law*. Infant baptism is seen as a sign of God’s covenant promises that will come to fruition once the child can profess faith. Believer baptism is viewed as evidence of a realized faith and a personal conversion.\n\n---\n\n### Points of Theological Discipline & Respect\n\n- **Scriptural Interpretation**  \n  Each view draws on a different set of scriptural passages. Those who hold a sacramental view emphasize the *cumulative narrative* of covenant promises in the Old & New Testaments, whereas those favoring believer's baptism focus primarily on the *New Testament* accounts of adult baptisms (Acts, Galatians).\n\n- **Historic Development**  \n  The East/West divide, the Reformation, and the American frontier all produce distinct understandings; each tradition’s history helped shape its baptismal theology.\n\n- **Respect for the Holy Spirit**  \n  Across the spectrum, many agree that the Spirit is the ultimate performer of the grace that baptism announces or brings about. Whether that agency is more through *water* or *spirit* varies, but the Spirit’s role remains central.\n\n- **Mutual Understanding**  \n  Given the shared Trinitarian core and broad scriptural basis, the differences are often *doctrinally significant but practically manageable*. Christians may differ in wording or practice while still honouring the same God who “drew us toward Himself” (Romans 5:5).\n\n---\n\n### Taking a Personal Stance? (You’re Welcome to Pick!)\n\nIf you are seeking to decide which view resonates with your understanding, consider:\n\n- **Your reading of Scripture**: What passages do you find most compelling?  \n- **Your sense of discipline in worship**: Do you prefer a tradition that marks faith with a specific rite, or one that emphasizes free faith?  \n- **Your view of church authority**: Does your community place weight on church law or on individual conviction?  \n\nWhatever path you walk, most mainstream traditions stand firmly on the truth that baptism is a command of Christ, performed in the name of the Triune God, and an act that moves believers from the “worldly” to the “heavenly.” With an eye on love and respect, Christians across lines will continue to participate in this profound act of faith.",

Key problems include: (1) mischaracterizing major traditions (e.g., JW immersion vs. sprinkling; Adventist views; INC practices) and using inaccurate descriptors (e.g., “outside the command” for Adventists, “prayerful injection” for Methodists). (2) Using misapplied or incorrect scriptural references (e.g., 1 Corinthians 3:16 as a baptismal basis; conflating various passages without acknowledging differing hermeneutics). (3) Blurring important doctrinal distinctions—infant baptism, believer’s baptism, sacramental grace vs. ordinance, and the role of baptism in salvation—into a single table without adequate nuance. (4) Inconsistent terminology (infusion vs. immersion vs. affusion) that can mislead readers about a tradition’s actual practice. (5) Some entries rely on oversimplified or inaccurate summaries (e.g., claims about sacred status of baptism in Adventism, or Catholic teaching on salvation for infants, or Orthodox/patristic baptismal theology). Although the core idea—that Christians differ on who is baptized, when, and the mode, with a shared Trinitarian formula and general emphasis on baptismal importance—appears, the numerous factual and interpretive errors make the overall answer unreliable without substantial correction and clarification."
