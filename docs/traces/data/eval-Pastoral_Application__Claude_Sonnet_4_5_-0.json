    "input": "A church member asks: 'My teenage daughter just told me she's questioning her faith and doesn't know if she believes in God anymore. I'm devastated and scared. What should I do?'",
    "expected": "First, thank God that your daughter trusts you enough to share her doubts honestly. Doubt is often part of faith development, not its opposite. Respond with love, not fear or anger. Create a safe space for her questions - faith that can't handle questions isn't strong faith. Listen more than you lecture. Ask what specific doubts she has and take them seriously. Provide good resources addressing her questions (books, podcasts, trusted mentors). Pray for and with her. Remember that God loves her more than you do, and His Spirit is at work even in her doubts. Continue modeling authentic faith yourself. Peter reminds us to always be ready to give a reason for our hope 'with gentleness and respect' (1 Peter 3:15) - that applies to our children too.",
    "output": "I can hear the love and concern in your words, and I want you to know that what you're experiencing is more common than you might think—and it's not without hope.\n\n## First, Take a Breath\n\nYour daughter came *to you* with her doubts. That's significant. She trusts you enough to be honest rather than hiding or pretending. This is actually a gift, though it doesn't feel like one right now. Many young people walk away silently; yours is still talking.\n\n## Doubt Is Not the Opposite of Faith\n\nRemember that many biblical heroes wrestled with doubt—Job, David, Thomas, even John the Baptist from prison (Matthew 11:3). Questioning can be part of a faith that's becoming her own rather than just borrowed from you. As Proverbs 2:3-5 suggests, seeking understanding is part of finding knowledge of God.\n\n## Practical Steps Forward\n\n**1. Listen more than you talk** (James 1:19)\n- Ask questions: \"What's making you question?\" \"What would you need to see or understand differently?\"\n- Don't rush to fix it or argue her out of doubts\n- Validate her honesty: \"I'm glad you told me\"\n\n**2. Examine your own response**\n- Your fear is natural, but be careful not to communicate that her doubts threaten your love or acceptance\n- Children can sense when they've become a \"project\" rather than a beloved daughter\n- Model what faith looks like when it's tested, not just when it's easy\n\n**3. Create space for honest conversation**\n- Let her know that questions are welcome in your home\n- Share your own journey—times you've doubted or struggled\n- Avoid clichés; teens can smell inauthentic answers\n\n**4. Provide good resources**\n- Consider books that take questions seriously (*The Reason for God* by Tim Keller, *Mere Christianity* by C.S. Lewis)\n- Connect her with a trusted youth pastor or mentor who remembers what doubt feels like\n- Intelligent faith requires wrestling with hard questions\n\n**5. Don't neglect wisdom and boundaries**\n- Continue inviting her to church without making it World War III if she resists\n- Maintain family rhythms of faith (meals together, prayer, service) without being legalistic\n- Remember: you're still the parent. Love doesn't mean abandoning all structure.\n\n## Remember God's Sovereignty\n\nHere's the truth that should comfort you most: your daughter is not outside God's reach. He loves her more than you do, and He's not threatened by her questions. In Luke 15, the father lets the prodigal son go, and watches, and waits, and welcomes. \n\n\"The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it\" (1 Thessalonians 5:24). If God has begun a work in her, He will complete it (Philippians 1:6)—though perhaps not on your timeline or through your preferred method.\n\n## Your Primary Role\n\nYour job is not to be the Holy Spirit. You cannot argue, manipulate, or force her into genuine faith—and you shouldn't try. Your calling is to:\n- **Love her unconditionally** (as God loves us—Romans 5:8)\n- **Pray faithfully** (1 Samuel 12:23)\n- **Live authentically** (let her see real faith in you)\n- **Trust God ultimately** (Proverbs 3:5-6)\n\n## One More Thought\n\nSome of the strongest believers I know went through a season of serious doubt in their teens or twenties. That wilderness became the place where their faith took root deeply. God often uses questions to move us from a shallow, inherited faith to a deep, personal one.\n\nWalk with her through this. Don't run ahead in panic or shame. Don't minimize it, but don't catastrophize either. Stay close, stay calm, stay prayerful.\n\n\"Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it\" (Proverbs 22:6). You've planted seeds. Trust the One who gives the growth (1 Corinthians 3:7).\n\nI'm praying for you both. Would you like to talk more about what specific questions she's wrestling with?",

          "rationale": "The LLM response is pastorally strong and aligns with orthodox Christian teaching on doubt as a normal part of faith development, the importance of listening, modeling authentic faith, and trusting God’s sovereignty. It cites appropriate Scripture (Job, Thomas, John the Baptist/David; Luke 15; 1 Thessalonians 5:24; Philippians 1:6; 2:3-5 in spirit; James 1:19; 1 Samuel 12:23; Proverbs 3:5-6) and offers practical steps and resources. It correctly emphasizes love, safety for questions, and not treating doubts as threats to parental love. A minor doctrinal nuance concern is the use of Proverbs 22:6 as a universal guarantee, which could mislead readers about the certainty of a child’s lasting faith. The rest of the guidance is consistent with historic Christian orthodoxy and biblical teaching, and the response captures important nuances about doubt, process, and pastoral care."
