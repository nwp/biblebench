    "expected": "Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both biblical truths held in tension. God is completely sovereign over all things, yet humans are genuine moral agents responsible for their choices. Scripture teaches both that God ordains all things and that humans make real choices for which they are accountable. Different theological traditions emphasize these aspects differently (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), but orthodox Christianity affirms both truths without fully resolving the mystery of how they relate.",
    "output": "## 1) What Christians mean by **divine sovereignty**\n**Divine sovereignty** is God’s supreme rule over all creation—his right and power to govern, sustain, and direct everything toward his wise purposes.\n\nBiblical emphases:\n- God “does according to his will… and none can stay his hand” (Daniel 4:35).\n- God declares “the end from the beginning” and accomplishes all his purpose (Isaiah 46:9–10).\n- God “works all things according to the counsel of his will” (Ephesians 1:11).\n- Even “the king’s heart is a stream of water” in God’s hand (Proverbs 21:1).\n\nSovereignty includes providence: God not only creates but also upholds and governs (Hebrews 1:3; Colossians 1:17).\n\n## 2) What Christians mean by **human responsibility**\n**Human responsibility** is the truth that humans are genuine moral agents: we make real choices, are commanded to obey, are called to repent and believe, and are accountable to God for what we do.\n\nBiblical emphases:\n- God commands repentance and holds people accountable (Acts 17:30–31).\n- God sets before humans life and death and calls them to choose (Deuteronomy 30:19).\n- God judges “each one according to what he has done” (Romans 2:6; cf. 2 Corinthians 5:10).\n- People are culpable for rejecting God’s will (Matthew 23:37; John 5:40).\n\n## 3) Scripture holds **both** together (not as rivals, but as concurrent truths)\nThe Bible regularly places God’s sovereign purpose and human moral culpability in the same event. This is often called **concurrence**: God works through (not apart from) creaturely actions, without erasing the reality of those actions.\n\n### A) Joseph and his brothers\n- The brothers freely sinned and were guilty.\n- Yet God was sovereignly at work through their evil to save many.\n> “You meant evil against me, **but God meant it for good**” (Genesis 50:20).\n\nSame act, two “meanings” (intentions): human intent was evil; God’s intent was good.\n\n### B) The crucifixion of Christ (the clearest example)\nThe death of Jesus is:\n- **God’s definite plan** (sovereignty),\n- carried out by **lawless men** (responsibility).\n> “This Jesus… delivered up according to the **definite plan and foreknowledge of God**, you **crucified and killed**” (Acts 2:23).  \n> God predestined the event, yet the perpetrators are morally accountable (Acts 4:27–28).\n\nThis shows the Bible does not treat sovereignty as canceling responsibility.\n\n### C) Pharaoh\nPharaoh hardens his heart and is guilty (Exodus 8:15, 32), and God also hardens Pharaoh in judgment (Exodus 9:12; Romans 9:17–18). Scripture affirms both without portraying God as forcing innocent behavior.\n\n## 4) How can God be sovereign without making humans robots?\nA classic Christian way to express the relationship is:\n\n1. **God ordains ends and also ordains the means.**  \n   If God purposes to save, he also uses preaching, prayer, warnings, and human decisions as real instruments (Romans 10:14–17).\n\n2. **Human choices are “voluntary,” flowing from the heart.**  \n   People act according to what they want (Luke 6:43–45). This preserves genuine agency: we do what we desire, and therefore we are responsible.\n\n3. **God is the primary cause; creatures are true secondary causes.**  \n   God’s providence establishes the certainty of events, but he ordinarily accomplishes his will through creaturely actions that remain authentically theirs.\n\nDifferent Christian traditions describe the mechanics differently (e.g., Reformed “compatibilism,” Arminian emphasis on prevenient grace and resistible calling, Catholic/Orthodox “synergy”), but broadly orthodox Christianity refuses to surrender either biblical truth: God reigns, and humans answer to God.\n\n## 5) A necessary boundary: God’s sovereignty and the reality of sin\nScripture is careful here:\n- God is perfectly holy and never the author of evil in a morally blameworthy way.\n> “God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one” (James 1:13).  \n- Yet God can **permit/ordain** that evil occurs within his providence for wise ends, while the evil intent belongs to sinners (Genesis 50:20; Acts 2:23).\n\nA common theological distinction is between:\n- God’s **preceptive (moral) will**: what he commands (e.g., “You shall not murder”).\n- God’s **decretive (sovereign) will**: what he ordains to occur in history for his purposes (including the cross), without endorsing the evil of the perpetrators.\n\n## 6) Why this matters pastorally\n- **Humility and worship:** salvation and history are not ultimately in human control (Romans 11:33–36).\n- **Urgency and accountability:** God’s commands, warnings, and invitations are real (Acts 17:30; Revelation 22:17).\n- **Confidence in evangelism and prayer:** God uses means; our actions matter, and God is able to accomplish his saving purposes through them (2 Timothy 2:10; Romans 10:14–17).\n- **Comfort in suffering:** evil does not have final sovereignty; God can work even grievous wrongs toward ultimate good (Romans 8:28).\n\n**In sum:** the Bible teaches that God sovereignly governs all things, and humans freely (voluntarily) make real choices for which they are morally accountable. The relationship is not a zero-sum competition; God’s sovereignty establishes the certainty and direction of history, while human responsibility establishes the justice of God’s commands and judgments.",

          "rationale": "The response provides a strong, biblically grounded, and historically orthodox treatment of divine sovereignty and human responsibility. It accurately presents key biblical texts and themes (sovereign decree, providence, human moral responsibility, concurrence, and the classic examples of Joseph, the crucifixion, and Pharaoh), and it articulates a coherent framework (sovereign ends and means, genuine human agency, and the distinction between God\u00199s preceptive vs decretive will). The main strengths are the clear articulation of concurrency and the pastoral implications. The notes listed under 'errors' are minor clarifications rather than doctrinal errors; a slightly more precise handling of the ongoing debate among Traditions on prevenient grace, resistible grace, and the mechanics of causation would further strengthen the nuance."

          "explanation": "The response presents a balanced, orthodox view of divine sovereignty and human responsibility. It affirms Scripture’s teaching that God sovereignly governs and ordains, while humans are genuine moral agents who make real, accountable choices. It cites key biblical texts to support both sovereignty and responsibility and explains concurrence (God works through creaturely actions without overriding genuine human agency). The examples (Joseph, the crucifixion, Pharaoh) illustrate how God’s purposes and human sinfulness coexist. It acknowledges different traditional descriptors (compatibilism, prevenient grace, synergy) without insisting on a single formula, which is historically common in orthodox theology. There are no explicit claims that deny the Trinity, negate Christ’s divinity, or embrace Pelagianism, modalism, Docetism, etc. Potential minor refinements could include more explicit Trinitarian grounding and a clearer doctrinal stance on the precise nature of predestination vs. human freedom, but none of these constitute heresy within the scope of the presented material."
