    "expected": "Being made in the image of God means humans uniquely reflect God's nature and character among creation. This includes rational thinking, moral awareness, creativity, relational capacity, and spiritual nature. While sin has marred this image, it hasn't been completely destroyed. The imago Dei gives humans inherent dignity and worth, distinguishes them from animals, and establishes the basis for human morality and purpose.",
    "output": "# The Image of God (Imago Dei): A Theological Overview\n\n## The Core Teaching\n\nThe imago Dei refers to the biblical doctrine that humans possess a unique likeness to God, establishing human dignity and worth. This appears explicitly in Genesis 1:27: \"So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them\" (NIV).\n\n## What the Image *Does* Encompass\n\n**Rational and moral capacity**: Humans possess reason, conscience, and the ability to distinguish right from wrong—capacities reflecting God's rational nature.\n\n**Relational ability**: We can form relationships, particularly with God and one another, mirroring the relational nature of the Trinity.\n\n**Moral agency**: We have genuine choice and responsibility, reflecting God's sovereign freedom.\n\n**Creative capacity**: Humans create, innovate, and steward creation in ways reflecting God's creative activity.\n\n**Spiritual dimension**: Only humans are described as capable of genuine communion with God.\n\n## What the Image Does *Not* Mean\n\n- **Physical resemblance**: God is spirit (John 4:24); the image is not bodily.\n- **Deity**: Humans are not divine; we remain creatures, fundamentally distinct from Creator.\n- **Unfailing goodness**: The image is compatible with human sinfulness (Genesis 9:6 assumes fallen humans still bear God's image).\n\n## Effects of the Fall\n\nSin corrupts but does not erase the imago Dei. This explains why:\n- Humans retain inherent dignity despite moral failure\n- Murder remains heinous (Genesis 9:6)\n- Christian transformation involves *restoration* of the image (Colossians 3:10; 2 Corinthians 3:18)\n\n## Theological Significance\n\nThe imago Dei grounds human rights, the sanctity of life, and the *possibility* of redemption through Christ, who is \"the image of the invisible God\" (Colossians 1:15).",

            "The claim 'Only humans are described as capable of genuine communion with God' is a simplification. Scripture indeed portrays humans as uniquely bearing God’s image and capable of fellowship with God, but angels and other beings engage with God in various ways too; some theologians caution against asserting a blanket 'only humans' statement without nuance."
          ],
          "rationale": "The response aligns with mainstream biblical teaching on the imago Dei: Gen 1:27 establishes image-bearing; the image spans rational/moral capacity, relationality, moral agency, creativity, and a spiritual dimension; the fall marred but did not erase the image; Col 3:10 and 2 Cor 3:18 describe ongoing transformation toward the divine likeness; the image grounds dignity, worth, and the sanctity of life, and Jesus is described as the image of the invisible God (Col 1:15). It correctly excludes physical likeness and deity, and notes that the image persists post-fall (Gen 9:6). Minor nuanced points could be added regarding the functional vs. substantive debates about the imago Dei and the exact nature of ‘communion’ with God compared to angels, but these do not undermine the overall accuracy."

          "explanation": "The response presents a standard, orthodox account of the Imago Dei. It affirms Gen 1:27, the fall, and the ongoing dignity of humans despite sin, as well as the restoration work of Christ and the Spirit. It correctly denies physical likeness to God, deity in humans, and the notion that sin eliminates the image. It also aligns with biblical Christology by noting that Christ is the image of the invisible God. There are no explicit Arian, Modalist, Pelagian, Gnostic, Docetist, or similar heresies. A minor nuance worth clarifying: while the claim that only humans possess genuine communion with God is broadly consistent with Scripture, some passages speak to creation’s knowledge of God and the fuller, Trinitarian basis of genuine communion through Christ and the Spirit; overall, the treatment remains orthodox."
