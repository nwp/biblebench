          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies Adoptionism as a heresy and situates it in the historical context of 2nd–3rd century Christology, noting that it teaches Jesus became the Son at a point in time (often baptism) rather than existing eternally as the Son. It affirms orthodox Christology: Jesus is the eternal Son, fully God and fully man, united in one person with two natures. It supports this with biblical grounding (John 1:1; Colossians 2:9; Philippians 2:6; Matthew 3:17) and references to key doctrinal developments (Nicene and Chalcedonian frameworks) without contradicting them. It also clarifies the baptism narrative as revealing Jesus’ identity, not origin, which preserves important nuances about the nature of adoptionist claims. A minor caveat is that the role of specific councils in explicitly condemning Adoptionism is historically nuanced; Adoptionism was condemned in early church history, but not all formulations were addressed uniformly at Nicaea. Overall, the response is accurate, sound, and nuanced."
