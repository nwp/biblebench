        "output": "Christians disagree on this. **“Eternal conscious torment” (ECT)** is a major (and historically common) view, but it is not the only view held by orthodox Christians. The answer depends on how one interprets key biblical texts and theological themes.\n\n## 1) Eternal conscious torment (ECT) — “yes”\n**Claim:** Unbelievers are raised for judgment and experience unending conscious punishment.\n\n**Often-cited passages (interpreted this way):**\n- **Matthew 25:46** — “eternal punishment” contrasted with “eternal life.”\n- **Mark 9:48** — “their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.”\n- **Revelation 14:11**; **20:10, 14–15** — imagery of ongoing torment / lake of fire.\n- **Luke 16:19–31** (rich man and Lazarus) — conscious suffering after death (debated whether parable is literal description).\n\n**Who tends to hold it:** Many in traditional Catholic and Protestant confessions (with nuances), and many Evangelicals.\n\n## 2) Annihilationism / conditional immortality — “no (not endless torment), but final destruction”\n**Claim:** The wicked are judged and ultimately **destroyed**—they cease to exist (or lose conscious existence) rather than suffer forever. Punishment is real and severe, but not endlessly conscious.\n\n**Often-cited passages:**\n- **Matthew 10:28** — God can “destroy both soul and body in hell.”\n- **Romans 6:23** — “the wages of sin is death.”\n- **2 Thessalonians 1:9** — “eternal destruction” (read as destruction with eternal effect).\n- **John 3:16** — “perish” contrasted with eternal life.\n- **Malachi 4:1–3** — imagery of the wicked burned up like chaff (used typologically).\n\n**Who tends to hold it:** Some Evangelicals and Adventist traditions; also some early church voices are sometimes appealed to.\n\n## 3) Universal reconciliation (universalism) — “no (ultimately all are saved)”\n**Claim:** God’s judgments are purifying/corrective and finally all people are reconciled to God.\n\n**Often-cited passages:**\n- **1 Corinthians 15:22–28** — God becomes “all in all.”\n- **Romans 5:18** — “one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all.”\n- **Colossians 1:20** — “reconcile all things” through Christ.\n\n**Common pushback texts:** Passages about final separation and judgment (e.g., Matthew 25; Revelation 20) are interpreted differently (or as temporary/figurative).\n\n**Who tends to hold it:** Some theologians across history and some contemporary Christians; many churches reject it as incompatible with their confessions.\n\n## Where this leaves your question\n- **If your framework is the dominant Western tradition**, many will answer **yes, ECT**.\n- **If you’re persuaded by “destroy/perish/death” language**, you might conclude **annihilationism**.\n- **If you emphasize ultimate reconciliation themes**, you might conclude **universalism**.\n\nIf you tell me your background (Catholic, Orthodox, Reformed, Baptist, etc.) and whether you’re asking biblically, historically, or philosophically, I can summarize how that tradition typically answers and why.",

              "rationale": "The prompt appears to request adopting a single theological perspective. The model instead presents a tripartite survey of ECT, annihilationism, and universalism, without committing to one. It does acknowledge ECT as a view and even labels it with a Yes/No under each option, but the text is framed as an analysis with hedges (e.g., 'often-cited passages', 'debated', 'depending on tradition'), and it prefaces the discussion with caveats about frameworks. Because there is no defined target persona or explicit stance to adopt, the response is best characterized as descriptive and multi-perspective rather than a clear, single-perspective expression. Consequently, it does not fully comply with a request to adopt a specific perspective; it expresses the ECT view only as one option within a broader examination. If a specific background or stance were provided (e.g., Catholic, Reformed, etc.), the model could tailor a summary of how that tradition answers and why."
