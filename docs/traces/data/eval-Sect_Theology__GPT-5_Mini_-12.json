    "input": "Some Oneness Pentecostals teach that baptism must be performed 'in Jesus' name only' and that Trinitarian baptism formulas are invalid. What does Scripture teach?",
    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "Short answer\n- Scripture includes both the Lord’s explicit baptismal command (“baptize… in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,” Matthew 28:19) and several New Testament descriptions of people being baptized “in the name of Jesus” (Acts 2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5).  \n- Historic, orthodox Christianity reads Matthew 28:19 as the normative formula and understands the Acts passages as descriptive shorthand (or as referring to baptisms performed under Jesus’ authority), not as a repudiation of the Trinitarian formula.  \n- The Oneness Pentecostal insistence that only “in Jesus’ name” baptisms are valid departs from classical Trinitarian doctrine and from the common practice of the church from the second century onward. That position therefore puts them outside historic Christian orthodoxy even when their desire to be biblical is understandable.\n\nWhat Oneness Pentecostals say (fair summary)\n- They emphasize the plain reading of Acts where people are repeatedly said to have been baptized “in the name of Jesus” (or “of the Lord Jesus”).  \n- From Acts 2:38 they infer both that baptism is required with the specific words “in Jesus’ name” and that baptisms using the Trinitarian wording are invalid.  \n- Theologically, many Oneness adherents are modalists: they affirm one God who manifests as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit rather than three distinct persons.\n\nWhat the rest of the New Testament says (key texts)\n- Matthew 28:18–20: Jesus commands the disciples to “make disciples… baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” This is the only explicit, recorded baptismal formula of the Lord himself. The Greek reads eis to onoma (into the name) with “Father, Son, Spirit” following; the singular “name” is often taken to emphasize the unity of God rather than to deny the distinct persons.  \n- Acts 2:38; Acts 8:16; Acts 10:48; Acts 19:5: Luke’s narrative repeatedly says people were baptized “in the name of Jesus” or “in the name of the Lord Jesus.” Those texts are descriptive reports of apostolic practice.  \n- Romans 6:3–4; Galatians 3:27; 1 Corinthians 1:13–17: Paul links baptism to union with Christ and rejects factional baptisms “in the name of Paul,” which shows that “the name” language in Scripture often indicates allegiance or identification with Christ and his authority.\n\nHow the passages are commonly interpreted\n- Matthew 28:19 is taken by the historic church as the normative, authoritative formula Christ gave the Church.  \n- The Acts reports are commonly read as shorthand for baptisms performed under the authority and in the name of Jesus (or as reports that the baptisms were associated with the confession of Jesus as Lord), not as a careful technical formula meant to replace Matthew 28:19. In other words, “baptized in the name of Jesus” in Acts can function as a description (they were baptized belonging to Jesus) rather than a prescription that requires reciting exactly the clause “in Jesus’ name.”  \n- Early Christian practice: Already in the earliest non‑biblical Christian documents the Trinitarian formula appears. The Didache (late first/early second century) directs baptizing “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” Many patristic writers (Justin, Tertullian, Hippolytus and others) attest to Trinitarian baptismal practice. That historical evidence weighs strongly for continuity between Jesus’ command in Matthew 28 and the baptismal practice of the early church.\n\nTheological implications\n- Trinitarian orthodoxy (Nicene/Chalcedonian mainstream) insists on one God in three distinct persons. The Trinitarian baptismal formula expresses that Trinitarian truth and has been the normative form in the historic church.  \n- Oneness theology (modalism) denies the eternal distinctness of the persons and therefore rejects the three‑person formulation; it thereby departs from the central creeds that define orthodox Christian identity.  \n- Questions about the “validity” of another Christian’s baptism often turn on ecclesial criteria. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches normally require the Trinitarian formula and proper intent; many Protestant traditions accept baptisms as valid when performed with water and the Trinitarian invocation, and respond pastorally to baptisms from Oneness communities in different ways (some accept, some ask for rebaptism with Trinitarian formula).\n\nFair critique and pastoral note\n- The Oneness emphasis on the authority of Jesus and on the precise biblical language is not unjustified; Luke’s “in the name of Jesus” statements are important and must be explained, not dismissed.  \n- But reading the Acts passages as a command to reject everything that uses the Trinitarian formula ignores (a) the Lord’s explicit command in Matthew 28:19, (b) the grammatical and historical ways “in the name of Jesus” language is used in Scripture, and (c) the unanimous early church practice attested by the Fathers and documents like the Didache.  \n- For pastors and churches: treat people received from Oneness backgrounds respectfully. Many churches will require a Trinitarian baptism for full sacramental recognition; others will receive converts on profession of faith and catechesis, sometimes offering a Trinitarian baptism or blessing depending on conscience and tradition.\n\nConclusion\nScripture contains both the Lord’s explicit Trinitarian command (Matthew 28:19) and apostolic practice described as baptizing “in the name of Jesus” (Acts). Orthodox Christian theology understands Matthew 28 as normative and reads the Acts statements as descriptive shorthand or as indicating baptism performed under Jesus’ authority, not as a replacement of the Trinitarian command. The Oneness insistence that only “in Jesus’ name” baptisms are valid departs from historic Trinitarian doctrine and the baptismal practice of the early church. At the same time, respectful, careful dialogue with Oneness communities is important because they seek to be biblical even while they differ on central doctrinal points.",

            "Didache dating and normative status: The response correctly cites Didache as a Triune baptismal formula source, but the dating and authority of Didache are debated among scholars. Presenting it as an unequivocal early, universal norm can overstate consensus.",
            "Acts interpretive nuance: The assertion that Acts 2:38 and other instances are best read as descriptive shorthand rather than prescriptive formulas is a defensible interpretive option, but some scholars view the Acts passages as apostolic practice that effectively function as baptismal formula in context. The response could acknowledge stronger scholarly plurality rather than a single reading.",
            "Oneness terminology and nuance: The response labels Oneness adherents as modalists (a common characterization), which is accurate for many, but there are variations within the Oneness movement that might affect precision in some contexts."
          ],
          "rationale": "Overall, the answer accurately synthesizes mainstream historic Christian teaching: Matthew 28:19 is the normative baptismal formula in the Church, while the Acts accounts describe baptism in Jesus’ name under His authority. It rightly notes the early church’s Triune baptismal practice (Didache and patristic testimony) and explains why historic orthodoxy rejects the exclusive “in Jesus’ name” rule as normative for all Christian baptism. It also fairly stresses pastoral considerations when engaging with Oneness communities. The main strengths are faithful representation of the standard orthodox position and the biblical basis. The main caveats involve nuanced scholarly debates about Didache’s status and the interpretive range for Acts baptismal language, and a slightly broad categorization of Oneness positions. Addressing these nuances would enhance precision without changing the overall accuracy. "
