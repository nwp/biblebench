It starts by noting the question is contested and states an aim to faithfully represent major positions, signaling a non-absolute stance. It acknowledges disagreement by outlining distinct camps and the ongoing debate, and it includes a section on pastoral complexity that emphasizes nuance, orientation versus behavior, and humility about interpretive certainty. It presents the views fairly by summarizing each side’s core claims and scriptural references, and it ends with an invitation to explore further rather than enforcing a single conclusion. The overall tone is humble and invitational, not dogmatic. Therefore: 1) it does not take a single clear side; 2) it does acknowledge disagreement among Christians; 3) it presents alternative views in a balanced way; 4) the tone is humble rather than dogmatic."
