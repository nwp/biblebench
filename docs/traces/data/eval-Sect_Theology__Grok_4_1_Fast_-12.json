    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "### Scriptural Teaching on the Baptismal Formula\n\nThe question addresses a distinctive teaching of Oneness Pentecostalism (also known as \"Jesus-Only\" Pentecostalism), which holds that valid Christian baptism requires the exact formula \"in Jesus' name\" (or \"in the name of Jesus Christ\"), and that baptisms using the Trinitarian formula (\"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\") are invalid and must be redone. This view stems from their unitarian theology, which rejects the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity (one God eternally existing in three distinct persons) in favor of modalism (one God manifesting in three modes or roles). Oneness adherents argue this formula aligns with apostolic practice and fulfills Jesus' command.\n\nTo analyze this biblically and in relation to orthodox Christian theology (as represented by the Nicene Creed, early church fathers, and the historic confessions of Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions), I'll examine the key Scriptures, their context, and interpretive principles. Scripture provides both a direct command from Jesus (Trinitarian) and descriptive examples from the apostles (Jesus-name focused), but it does not explicitly declare one formula invalidates the other.\n\n#### 1. **The Direct Command of Jesus: Matthew 28:19**\n   - **Text**: \"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, **baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit**\" (ESV; emphasis added).\n   - **Context**: This is the climax of the Great Commission, Jesus' final instructions to the apostles before his ascension (Matt. 28:16–20). It is a binding mandate tied to disciple-making and obedience.\n   - **Key Observations**:\n     - Jesus specifies a **Trinitarian formula**, invoking the singular \"name\" (Greek *onoma*, implying unity/authority) shared by three distinct persons: Father, Son, Holy Spirit.\n     - This reflects Jesus' own revelation of God's triune nature (e.g., Matt. 3:16–17 at his baptism; John 14–16 on the Father, Son, and Spirit).\n     - No Scripture contradicts or qualifies this command. It is the only direct prescription for baptism in the New Testament Gospels.\n\n#### 2. **Apostolic Examples in Acts: \"In Jesus' Name\"**\n   - Oneness Pentecostals emphasize these as the normative practice:\n     | Passage       | Formula Used                  | Context |\n     |---------------|-------------------------------|---------|\n     | Acts 2:38    | \"In the name of Jesus Christ\" | Peter's Pentecost sermon; ~3,000 baptized. |\n     | Acts 8:12–16 | \"In the name of the Lord Jesus\" | Philip in Samaria; later hands laid for Spirit. |\n     | Acts 10:48   | \"In the name of Jesus Christ\" | Peter with Cornelius' household (Gentiles). |\n     | Acts 19:5    | \"In the name of the Lord Jesus\" | Paul with John's disciples in Ephesus. |\n   - **Context and Interpretation**:\n     - These are **narrative descriptions**, not prescriptive commands. They highlight baptism **under the authority of Jesus** (Greek *en tō onomati*, \"in the name of\" = by the authority/power of), especially in a Jewish context where invoking Yahweh's name was key (cf. Acts 4:7,12 on salvation \"in no other name\").\n     - Acts does not quote a full verbal formula during baptisms; it summarizes the authority invoked. Peter preaches repentance \"in Jesus' name\" (Acts 2:38), but Jesus himself had just commanded the Trinitarian formula (Acts 1:8 echoes Matt. 28).\n     - No text in Acts uses the Trinitarian formula verbatim, but this absence doesn't invalidate it—Acts is selective history, not a baptismal manual.\n\n#### 3. **Relation to Orthodox Christian Theology**\n   - **Areas of Agreement**:\n     - **Baptism's Importance**: All traditions affirm baptism as an ordinance commanded by Christ (Matt. 28:19; Mark 16:16), symbolizing union with Christ's death/resurrection (Rom. 6:3–4), forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38), and entry into the church. Oneness emphasis on invoking Jesus aligns with the universal Christian stress on his lordship (Phil. 2:9–11).\n     - **Regeneration and Spirit**: Scripture links baptism to repentance, faith, and the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38; Titus 3:5), a point shared across traditions.\n     - **Jesus-Centered**: Orthodox theology fully affirms baptism \"in Jesus' name\" as authoritative, as the Son shares the divine name (John 17:11–12).\n\n   - **Areas of Departure**:\n     | Aspect                  | Oneness Pentecostal View                  | Orthodox Trinitarian View                  |\n     |-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n     | **Formula**            | \"Jesus' name only\"; Trinitarian invalid. | Trinitarian normative (Matt. 28:19); \"Jesus' name\" = authority, compatible. |\n     | **Underlying Theology**| Modalism: Father/Son/Spirit = modes of one person (Jesus). | Trinity: Three co-equal, co-eternal persons in one essence (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). |\n     | **Validity**           | Requires rebaptism in Jesus' name.       | Oneness baptisms often invalid due to heresy (modalism condemned at Council of Constantinople, 381 AD). |\n     | **Scriptural Priority**| Acts examples > Matt. 28:19 (seen as symbolic). | Jesus' command > descriptive examples; Acts fulfills Matt. 28:19. |\n\n     - **Why the Departure Matters**: Oneness teaching implicitly subordinates Jesus' words in Matthew 28:19 to Acts' summaries, treating narratives as superior to commands. Orthodox theology prioritizes Jesus' explicit instruction (John 14:15: \"If you love me, keep my commandments\"). Early church evidence (Didache ~100 AD; Justin Martyr ~150 AD; Tertullian ~200 AD) confirms uniform Trinitarian practice, refuting claims of a later \"invention.\"\n     - Modalism is a historic heresy (condemned alongside Arianism), as it denies distinct personhood (e.g., Jesus prays to the Father, John 17; Spirit descends separately, Matt. 3:16).\n\n#### 4. **What Scripture Teaches Overall**\n   - **Primary Teaching**: Jesus commands baptism **in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** (Matt. 28:19)—a Trinitarian formula reflecting God's revealed nature. Apostolic practice in Acts invokes **Jesus' authority** (\"in his name\") as the fulfillment of this, not a replacement. Both emphasize divine authority; neither declares the other invalid.\n   - **No Explicit Conflict**: Scripture harmonizes them: The triune name centers on Jesus (Col. 2:9–10), and baptism saves through faith in him (1 Pet. 3:21).\n   - **Warnings**: Altering Jesus' command risks disobedience (Deut. 4:2; Rev. 22:18–19). Requiring \"Jesus-only\" adds a test not in Scripture (Gal. 1:8).\n\nIn summary, while Oneness Pentecostals sincerely seek biblical fidelity, their position departs from orthodox Christianity by elevating Acts' descriptions over Jesus' prescription and rejecting the Trinity. Scripture upholds the Trinitarian formula as the mandated pattern, with Jesus' name as its saving center. Historic churches recognize only Trinitarian baptisms as valid, respectfully encouraging Oneness believers toward trinitarian faith for full communion.

          "rationale": "The answer accurately reflects orthodox Christian teaching on baptismal formula: Matthew 28:19 Presents a clear Trinitarian mandate, invoked as one name (Father, Son, and Spirit) reflecting the one God in three Persons; Acts records baptisms “in the name of Jesus” or “in the name of the Lord Jesus,” understood as baptisms committed under Jesus’ authority, not as a separate rival formula. The response correctly notes Acts is descriptive history, not a baptismal manual, and it argues that early church tradition (Didache, patristic writers) generally upheld Trinitarian baptism, aligning with historic confessions. It rightly identifies Oneness Pentecostalism as modalistic in its critique, and it highlights the doctrinal significance of the Trinity in orthodox orthopraxy. Nuance is present in distinguishing the command (Matthew 28:19) from the narrative formulations in Acts, and in acknowledging that unity of faith, not mere wording, is what matters. Potential refinements (not errors) could include a fuller discussion of how some scholars exegete Acts 2:38 and similar passages as expressions of the same Triune reality (authority of Jesus) rather than as a strictly separate “Jesus name only” practice, and more explicitly noting that the precise formula is debated among some scholars, though the orthodox consensus remains Trinitarian formulation as normative. Overall, the answer is aligned with Scripture and historic Christian orthodoxy and is appropriately nuanced.)"
