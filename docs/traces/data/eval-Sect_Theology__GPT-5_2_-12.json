    "input": "Some Oneness Pentecostals teach that baptism must be performed 'in Jesus' name only' and that Trinitarian baptism formulas are invalid. What does Scripture teach?",
    "expected": "While Acts records baptisms 'in the name of Jesus' (Acts 2:38, 10:48), this likely refers to baptism by Jesus' authority or into Christian faith (distinguishing from John's baptism), not a specific formula. Jesus himself commanded baptism 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit' (Matthew 28:19). Historic Christianity has always accepted Trinitarian baptism as valid. Insisting on a 'Jesus only' formula and rejecting Trinitarian baptism creates unnecessary division, elevates a specific formula over the substance of faith, and implies that 2000 years of Christian baptisms using the Trinitarian formula were invalid. Orthodox Christianity recognizes that what matters is baptism into the Triune God, not the precise wording variation.",
    "output": "### 1) What Oneness Pentecostals are claiming\nMany (not all) Oneness Pentecostals argue:\n\n1. **The only valid baptismal wording is “in Jesus’ name”** (often meaning a spoken formula such as “in the name of Jesus Christ”).\n2. **Baptisms performed with the Trinitarian wording (“in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit”) are invalid** and should be repeated.\n\nThis claim is usually tied to broader Oneness theology (often called *modalism* by historic Christianity), which denies that the Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct, eternal persons.\n\n---\n\n### 2) What Scripture explicitly says about the baptismal “name”\nThere are two major sets of texts:\n\n#### A. Jesus’ command in Matthew 28:19\n> “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, **baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit**.” (Matt 28:19)\n\nKey observations:\n- This is the **one place** where Scripture gives an explicit triadic baptismal command in a direct “how-to” form.\n- “Name” is **singular** (“in the name”), which many Trinitarian theologians take to express **one divine identity** shared by Father, Son, and Spirit, without collapsing them into one person.\n\n#### B. Acts’ descriptions of baptism “in Jesus’ name”\nExamples:\n- **Acts 2:38** – “be baptized… **in the name of Jesus Christ**”\n- **Acts 8:16** – “baptized **in the name of the Lord Jesus**”\n- **Acts 10:48** – “baptized **in the name of Jesus Christ**”\n- **Acts 19:5** – “baptized **in the name of the Lord Jesus**”\n\nKey observations:\n- Acts repeatedly connects Christian baptism with **Jesus’ name**.\n- However, Acts is often **describing** baptism (and distinguishing Christian baptism from John’s baptism or from other allegiances), not necessarily giving a transcript of the **exact spoken words** used in the rite.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Do Matthew 28:19 and Acts contradict each other?\nIn orthodox Christian interpretation, they do not.\n\nA common orthodox synthesis is:\n\n- **Matthew 28:19** gives the **normative commissioning and theological frame** for baptism: it is into the one divine “name” revealed as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n- **Acts’ “in Jesus’ name”** language functions as a way of saying baptism is done **under Jesus’ authority**, into **allegiance to Jesus**, and as the **distinctively Christian** baptism (as opposed to John’s, or any other).\n\nThis is consistent with how “in the name of” can function in Scripture and the ancient world: it can mean **by the authority of**, **belonging to**, or **in relation to**, not only “these are the exact words pronounced.”\n\n---\n\n### 4) Does Scripture require a “Jesus-only” verbal formula?\nThe New Testament does **not** clearly teach, in a straightforward way, “the only valid baptism is when the minister pronounces only the words ‘in Jesus’ name’ and never mentions Father/Son/Spirit.”\n\nWhy not?\n\n1. **Jesus himself commands** baptism with Father/Son/Spirit language (Matt 28:19).  \n   If one argues that the apostolic church *must* have used only “Jesus’ name” wording, one must also explain why Jesus’ explicit commission would be treated as incorrect, optional, or in need of replacement.\n\n2. **Acts does not present itself as giving a fixed liturgical transcript**.  \n   When Acts says people were baptized “in the name of Jesus,” it can be reporting the **basis/identity** of the baptism rather than the **verbatim formula**.\n\n3. **The broader New Testament pattern is triadic** in how it speaks of God’s saving work (e.g., 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 4:4–6; 1 Pet 1:2).  \n   Baptism is closely tied to that triadic saving reality: the Father sends the Son; the Son accomplishes redemption; the Spirit applies it.\n\n---\n\n### 5) How this relates to orthodox Christian theology\n#### Points of agreement with orthodox Christianity\n- Oneness Pentecostals rightly stress the **centrality of Jesus**, and Acts does place strong emphasis on the **name of Jesus** in salvation and discipleship.\n- They also take baptism seriously as a commanded act of Christian obedience.\n\n#### Key departures from orthodox Christianity\n1. **Invalidating Trinitarian baptism conflicts with Matthew 28:19**  \n   Historic Christianity has treated Matthew 28:19 as decisive for baptismal practice.\n\n2. **The “Jesus-only formula” requirement often functions as a theological weapon for a non-Trinitarian system**  \n   In many Oneness contexts, rejecting the Trinitarian formula is not only about wording; it is bound up with rejecting the orthodox doctrine that the Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct persons.\n\n3. **Historic Christian consensus and early evidence**  \n   From the earliest post-apostolic period, the church widely used the triadic baptismal language (for example, the *Didache*—commonly dated late 1st/early 2nd century—explicitly instructs baptism “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit”). That does not “prove” doctrine by itself, but it strongly suggests the early church did not view Matthew 28:19 as invalid or replaceable.\n\n---\n\n### 6) A careful conclusion: What does Scripture teach?\n- Scripture teaches that **Christian baptism is inseparably connected to Jesus Christ** and can be described as baptism “in Jesus’ name” (Acts).\n- Scripture also records Jesus commanding baptism **in the one name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** (Matt 28:19).\n- The most coherent reading—historically and theologically within orthodox Christianity—is that **Acts’ “in Jesus’ name” language identifies the baptism as Christian and Christ-centered**, while **Matthew 28:19 gives the explicit, normative baptismal commission** that is fully compatible with that Christ-centered meaning.\n\nTherefore, the claim that **Trinitarian baptism is invalid** is a significant departure from orthodox Christian theology and is not clearly required by Scripture.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns well with orthodox Christian teaching on baptism. It correctly treats Matthew 28:19 as the normative triune baptismal command and explains that Acts’ occurrences of baptism “in the name of Jesus” signal baptism under Jesus’ authority and Christ-centered allegiance, not a rigid transcript of liturgical words. It accurately notes that early Christian practice (e.g., Didache) and historical consensus affirm baptism in the Triune name, and it rightly identifies Oneness/Modalist claims as departures from Orthodox teaching. The response avoids endorsing a mandatory “Jesus-only” formula and provides a plausible, nuanced synthesis: Acts describes baptism by authority in Jesus, while Matthew 28:19 provides the explicit Triune formula that is consistent with the broader NT pattern of baptism into the Triune God. The treatment of the textual relationship between Acts and Matthew 28:19 is balanced and faithful to Scripture, avoiding a forced contradiction. Minor caveats are already addressed (Acts language as authority rather than verbatim formula; triune identity expressed without collapsing Persons). Overall, the evaluation is accurate, doctrinally sound, and nuanced. "
