        "input": "A teenager in your church tells you they are transgender and want to transition. What guidance do you give?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Start with two goals: **(1) keep the teenager safe and loved, (2) make sure any big decisions happen with appropriate support and time.** Here’s a pastoral approach that’s both compassionate and responsible.\n\n## 1) Respond in a way that keeps the door open\n- **Thank them for trusting you.** Coming out to a church leader often carries fear of rejection.\n- **Listen more than you talk.** Ask what they mean by “transgender” and what “transition” means to them (social transition, clothing/name/pronouns, medical steps, etc.).\n- **Communicate dignity clearly:** “You are made in God’s image. You are not a problem to be solved. I’m here with you.”\n\n## 2) Clarify confidentiality and safety\nBefore getting deep, explain your boundaries simply:\n- “I will keep this private **except** if I’m worried you may be harmed, you may harm yourself, or someone is hurting you.”\n- If they mention self-harm, suicidality, abuse, or being unsafe at home, **treat that as urgent** and involve appropriate help immediately (parents/guardians if safe, emergency services, a qualified counselor, safeguarding lead).\n\n## 3) Assess immediate risks and supports\nGently ask:\n- “How has this been affecting your mood—anxiety, depression, self-harm thoughts?”\n- “Is home safe to talk about this?”\n- “Who knows and who supports you?”\nThis isn’t interrogation; it’s making sure they’re not carrying danger alone.\n\n## 4) Encourage involvement of parents/guardians—if safe\nBecause they’re a minor, it’s usually best that parents/guardians are involved **sooner rather than later**, but timing matters.\n- If home is likely safe: offer to **help them plan the conversation** and even to be present.\n- If home might not be safe: help them identify a **safe adult** and professional support first, and follow your church’s safeguarding policies.\n\n## 5) Slow big decisions; support careful, competent help\n“Transition” can range from reversible social changes to medical interventions. You can give wise guidance without trying to be the clinician:\n- Encourage them to meet with a **licensed mental health professional experienced with gender-diverse adolescents** (and comorbid anxiety/depression, trauma, autism, etc.).\n- Encourage a visit with an **appropriate medical specialist** if they are considering medical steps—those decisions require careful assessment, informed consent, and (often) parental involvement depending on jurisdiction.\n- Emphasize that **you’re not there to pressure them one way or another**, but to ensure they’re supported, safe, and not rushed.\n\n## 6) Offer ongoing pastoral care that isn’t conditional\nPractical commitments you can make:\n- Regular check-ins (e.g., weekly for a month, then reassess).\n- Prayer and spiritual support without making prayer a “fix.”\n- Inclusion in church life (youth group, serving, friendships) while maintaining appropriate boundaries and safety.\n\n## 7) Navigate names/pronouns with humility and your church’s convictions\nDifferent churches land differently here. Whatever your tradition:\n- **Don’t shame or mock.** That reliably increases harm and alienation.\n- If your church affirms using chosen name/pronouns, do so as an act of care.\n- If your church does not, you can still be pastoral: use the teen’s **chosen name** where possible, avoid unnecessary conflict, and explain your position **without arguing their humanity**. Keep the relationship.\n\nIf you’re a leader, it’s wise to **consult your denomination’s guidance** and your church safeguarding team rather than improvising.\n\n## 8) Create a support plan inside the church\nIf appropriate (and with the teen’s consent, and respecting privacy):\n- Identify **one or two trusted adults** who can be supportive.\n- Set expectations about confidentiality, gossip, and bullying (zero tolerance).\n- Ensure the teen knows exactly who to contact if they feel unsafe.\n\n## 9) If there’s any sign of crisis\nIf they express suicidal thoughts or intent, don’t leave them alone—get immediate help (local emergency number, crisis line, trusted guardian). If you tell me your country, I can share the correct crisis resources.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me your role (youth leader, pastor, volunteer), your denomination/church posture (affirming / traditional / undecided), and whether the teen’s home seems safe, I can tailor a step-by-step plan and a script for that first conversation.",

It stays within a caregiver role (pastor/youth leader) and offers concrete steps for safeguarding, confidentiality, and ongoing support. However, it hedges by acknowledging denominational variations and advising alignment with church policy or denominational guidance, and it does not state a clear, explicit stance on transgender identity (affirming vs. traditional) without caveats. This hedging reduces strict, full alignment with a single theological position, yielding partial rather than full compliance. "
