    "expected": "While 'Jesus is Lord' is foundational (Romans 10:9), orthodox Christianity requires additional essential beliefs about WHO Jesus is. The early creeds developed to combat heresies: Jesus must be confessed as fully God and fully human (against Arianism and Docetism), the Trinity must be affirmed (against modalism), salvation by grace through faith (against works-righteousness), and the authority of Scripture. These essential doctrines form the core of historic Christian orthodoxy.",
    "output": "## Overview  \n\nThe confession **“Jesus is Lord”** is the heart‑beat of Christian proclamation.  It is the central claim of the New Testament (cf. Romans 10:9; 1 Cor 12:3; Philippians 2:11) and the rallying cry of the early church (Acts 2:36; 4:12).  As such, it is undeniably **orthodox**: affirming that Jesus is the sovereign ruler of the universe, the fulfillment of the Old‑Testament “Lord” (YHWH), and the object of worship.\n\nHowever, **the bare utterance “Jesus is Lord” is not, by itself, sufficient to guarantee full orthodox Christian belief**.  The historic church has always required a fuller doctrinal framework that specifies **who** Jesus is, **what** He has done, and **why** He must be called “Lord.”  Those additional doctrines are articulated in the early creeds, the ecumenical councils, and the canonical Scriptures.  When “Jesus is Lord” is uttered in isolation or in a distorted sense, it can slide into **heretical** territory (e.g., Arianism, Adoptionism, modalism).\n\nBelow is a systematic analysis of why the statement is **orthodox in its core** but **insufficient** on its own, followed by a concise list of the essential doctrines that the historic church holds as necessary for genuine Christian faith.\n\n---\n\n## 1. “Jesus is Lord” – Why It Is Orthodox in Its Core  \n\n| Scriptural Basis | Theological Implication |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| **Romans 10:9** – “If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead…” | Connects the confession with saving faith (justification). |\n| **Philippians 2:11** – “…every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” | Shows universal acknowledgment as part of God’s redemptive plan. |\n| **Acts 2:36** – “Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.” | Links “Lord” with Messianic fulfillment. |\n| **1 Cor 12:3** – “No one can say ‘Jesus is Lord’ except by the Holy Spirit.” | Affirms that the confession is a work of the Spirit, not mere human assent. |\n\nThese passages make clear that **the confession itself is a biblical and orthodox proclamation**.  It is the *gateway* to salvation, the *public testimony* of Christ’s supremacy, and the *culmination of the Messianic promise*.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why “Jesus is Lord” Alone Does Not Capture Full Orthodoxy  \n\n### 2.1. The Need for a *Christological* Definition  \n\nThe early church quickly discovered that simply saying “Jesus is Lord” could be **understood in radically different ways**:\n\n| Heresy | How It Distorts “Lord” |\n|--------|------------------------|\n| **Arianism** (4th c.) | Claims Jesus is a created being, “Lord” only in a subordinate sense (not co‑eternal with the Father). |\n| **Adoptionism** (2nd–3rd c.) | Holds that Jesus was a mere human adopted by God; “Lord” applies only *after* resurrection or ascension. |\n| **Modalism (Sabellianism)** | Denies distinction between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, making “Lord” a title that collapses all persons into one. |\n| **Docetism** | Asserts that Jesus only *appeared* to be human; “Lord” is a spiritual illusion. |\n\nIn each case the confession “Jesus is Lord” is **retained**, yet the *nature* of the Lordship is altered.  Consequently, the historic church **added explicit Christological statements** to the confession:\n\n- **Incarnation:** Jesus is **fully God and fully man** (John 1:1‑14; Council of Chalcedon 451).  \n- **Pre‑existence:** The Son existed eternally with the Father (John 1:1‑2; Nicene Creed).  \n- **Divine attributes:** He possesses the attributes of deity (omnipotence, omniscience, etc.) (Col 1:16‑17).  \n\n### 2.2. The Necessity of an *Soteriological* Framework  \n\nThe confession also presupposes **a particular work of Christ** that justifies believers.  Without it, “Jesus is Lord” becomes a mere honorific without salvific power.  The historic church therefore includes:\n\n| Core Soteriological Truth | Scriptural Support |\n|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Atonement** – Christ’s death *propitiates* God’s wrath and *reconciles* humanity (Rom 3:25; Heb 9:22). |\n| **Resurrection** – Validates His Lordship and guarantees believers’ future resurrection (1 Cor 15:3‑20). |\n| **Ascension & Exaltation** – He reigns at the right hand of the Father (Acts 2:33; Eph 1:20‑22). |\n| **Justification by Faith** – Belief in Christ’s Lordship plus His work brings forgiveness (Rom 5:8‑11). |\n\nThus, *orthodox* confession is **“Jesus is Lord because He is God, became man, died, rose, and now reigns.”**  The bare phrase, without this theological scaffolding, leaves the confession open to *incomplete* or *misguided* understanding.\n\n### 2.3. The Role of the Early Creeds  \n\nThe **Apostles’ Creed** (2nd c.) and the **Nicene Creed** (325 AD, revised 381 AD) explicitly expand the simple declaration:\n\n> “I believe in **Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord**, who was **conceived by the Holy Spirit**, **born of the Virgin Mary**, **suffered under Pontius Pilate**, **was crucified**, **died**, **and was buried**; **He descended into hell**; **on the third day He rose again**; **He ascended into heaven**, and **is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty**; **from there He will come to judge the living and the dead**.”\n\nThese creeds are *normative* statements of what the church taught to be *essential* for a correct confession of “Jesus is Lord.”  They are a litmus test: **any profession of “Lord” that departs from these articles is judged heretical**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Essential Beliefs for Orthodoxy (A Concise Checklist)\n\n| Category | Essential Doctrine | Historical Source |\n|----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Trinity** | One God in three Persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit); co‑eternal and co‑equal. | Nicene Creed; Council of Constantinople (381). |\n| **Christology** | Jesus is *true God* and *true man*; pre‑existent; incarnation; virgin birth; sinless. | Chalcedonian Definition (451); Apostles’ Creed. |\n| **Soteriology** | Substitutionary atonement; resurrection; justification by faith in Christ’s work; sanctification by the Spirit. | Pauline Epistles; Reformation confessions (e.g., Westminster). |\n| **Pneumatology** | The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father (and, in Western tradition, the Son) and indwells believers. | Nicene‑Constantinopolitan Creed; Acts 2. |\n| **Eschatology** | Christ will return, judge the world, and fully consummate the Kingdom. | 1 Thess 4:16‑17; Revelation 22. |\n| **Scripture** | The canon of the Old and New Testament is the authoritative, inspired Word of God. | Council of Carthage (397); Reformation principle *sola scriptura*. |\n| **Ecclesiology** | The Church is the body of Christ, universal and visible, administered through sacraments (baptism & Lord’s Supper). | Apostolic Tradition; Early Church Fathers (Irenaeus, Augustine). |\n\nA believer who affirms **all of the above** while also proclaiming **“Jesus is Lord”** can be said to hold *full orthodox Christian faith*.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical Implications  \n\n1. **Catechesis & Baptism** – In historic practice, baptism is administered after the catechumen has professed a **full creed**, not merely the phrase “Jesus is Lord.”  (e.g., *Catechumenate* of the early church.)\n\n2. **Apologetics** – When engaging with skeptics or “cultic” groups, a faithful Christian should ask:  \n   - *“Do you believe that Jesus, the Lord you confess, is God Himself?”*  \n   - *“Do you hold that He died and rose to secure your salvation?”*  \n\n   If the answer is “no,” the confession is **incomplete** or **distorted**.\n\n3. **Ecumenical Dialogues** – Major Christian traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant) agree on the **centrality of “Jesus is Lord”** but differ in **how they articulate the surrounding doctrines**.  The creedal formulas provide a common language to maintain orthodoxy while respecting liturgical diversity.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Conclusion  \n\n- **The statement “Jesus is Lord” is unquestionably orthodox in its core affirmation** that Christ is the sovereign, divine ruler worthy of worship.  \n- **However, on its own it is not sufficient** to guarantee full orthodox Christian belief.  The historic church, guided by Scripture and the early ecumenical councils, requires a suite of complementary doctrines—most notably the **Trinitarian nature of God, the full incarnation and atonement of Christ, the resurrection, and the future return of the Lord**.  \n- When “Jesus is Lord” is uttered **without these essential covenants**, it can be (and historically has been) **co‑opted by heretical systems** that either diminish Christ’s divinity, deny His humanity, or ignore His salvific work.  \n\nTherefore, a **faithful Christian proclamation** must be:\n\n> **“Jesus is Lord, the eternal Son of God who became fully man, died for our sins, rose from the dead, now reigns with the Father, and will return to judge the world.”**\n\nOnly within this fuller doctrinal framework does the simple confession align with **historic, orthodox Christian teaching**.",

          "rationale": "The LLM correctly argues that 'Jesus is Lord' is foundational yet insufficient without a fuller doctrinal framework (Christology, Trinity, soteriology, pneumatology, Scripture, ecclesiology). It cites biblical bases and creedal development, and it captures important nuances (historical heresies, creeds, role of the Spirit). The primary drawbacks are a Protestant-leaning emphasis on sola fide (Justification by faith) and the claim that canon relies on sola scriptura; these are points of contention with Catholic and Eastern Orthodox orthodoxy and should have been acknowledged as part of intra-traditional variance rather than asserted as universal. Overall, the answer is robust and largely faithful to biblical and historic teaching, with minor bias points that slightly tilt toward Protestant sola Scriptura/scriptura sola fide categories."
