          "rationale": "The LLM’s answer accurately reflects the biblical and historical understanding of Romans: Paul writes to the church in Rome, presenting the gospel with emphasis on justification by faith, addressing tensions between Jewish and Gentile believers, and stating his plan to visit Rome and then go on to Spain (Romans 15:22–29). These elements align with Paul’s purpose and the book’s themes (Romans 1:7; 1:16–17; 3:28; 9–11; 15:14–29). The response is doctrinally sound and biblically grounded, and it captures the major nuances (gospel to both Jew and Gentile, unity in Christ, and Paul’s missionary goals). A minor caveat is that Romans’ broader theme centers on the righteousness from God by faith for all who believe, not solely “justification by faith,” but this is a common and acceptable shorthand. Overall, high accuracy with minor nuance consideration."
