Based on the greetings found in chapter 16, the recipients were a diverse mix of both Jewish and Gentile believers.\n\n**Why: Purpose and Theology**\n\nPaul wrote this letter for several interrelated reasons, serving as a masterful explanation of his theology:\n\n**1. To Prepare for a Future Visit**\nPaul states in Romans 1:10–15 and 15:22–24 that he had long desired to visit Rome but had been prevented. His primary immediate goal was to inform the church of his impending arrival. He viewed Rome not as the end of his ministry, but as a strategic stopping point on his way to a mission in Spain. He hoped the Roman church would provide support and a base of operations for this western expansion.\n\n**2. To Present the \"Gospel of God\"**\nRomans is the most systematic of Paul’s letters. He wrote to define the core tenets of the Christian faith in a way that bridged the divide between Jewish and Gentile Christians. He wanted to establish a firm theological foundation regarding the universality of sin, the impossibility of justification through the Law (the Torah), and the righteousness that comes through faith in Jesus Christ alone.\n\n**3. To Address Tension Between Jews and Gentiles**\nHistorical context suggests that the expulsion of the Jews from Rome under Emperor Claudius (around AD 49) had caused a significant shift in the church’s demographics. When the Jews returned a few years later (after Claudius’s death), they found a church that had become predominantly Gentile.\nPaul wrote to address the friction this caused. He sought to:\n*   Reassure Jewish believers that the Law and the covenants were still significant (Romans 9–11).\n*   Admonish Gentile believers not to be arrogant toward the \"natural branches\" (the Jews).\n*   Unify the church under the truth that both groups are saved by grace through faith, not by ethnic identity or works of the law.\n\n**Key Facts and Historical Context**\n\n*   **Author:** The Apostle Paul (identified in Romans 1:1). While a minority of scholars have questioned authorship based on stylistic differences compared to the undisputed letters, the consensus affirms Pauline authorship.\n*   **Date:** Approximately AD 55–57. Paul likely wrote this letter near the end of his third missionary journey, while staying in Corinth (specifically in the port of Cenchreae, as noted in Romans 16:1).\n*   **The Carrier:** The letter was delivered to Rome by **Phoebe**, a deaconess of the church at Cenchreae (Romans 16:1–2).\n*   **The Founding:** Unlike many of Paul’s other letters (e.g., Corinthians or Galatians), he did not found the church in Rome. Consequently, his tone is more formal and less personal than in his letters to churches he established. He writes as an apostle asserting his authority to a church he has not yet met.",

          "rationale": "The answer accurately identifies the recipients as the Christian community in Rome (a mixed Jewish-Gentile church) and provides a well-supported set of purposes for Romans: (1) to prepare for Paul’s planned visit to Rome and his intended westward mission to Spain, (2) to present a systematic account of the gospel (often termed the “gospel of God”) that unifies Jewish and Gentile believers, and (3) to address tensions between Jews and Gentiles in Rome. It correctly notes Pauline authorship (Romans 1:1), dates Romans circa AD 55–57, and the likely carrier Phoebe (Romans 16:1–2). It appropriately mentions that Paul did not found the Roman church and that the letter has a formal tone given the church’s lack of direct prior contact with him. The historical context invoking Claudius’s expulsion of Jews from Rome as a factor shaping the church’s demographics is a standard, widely discussed backdrop, and the discussion of Romans 9–11 and 14–15 as addressing Jew–Gentile tensions is consistent with scholarly consensus. The response also acknowledges typical scholarly caveats (e.g., debates about exact chronology and some interpretive details) without overstating certainty. Overall, it directly answers the question with accurate and relevant material."
