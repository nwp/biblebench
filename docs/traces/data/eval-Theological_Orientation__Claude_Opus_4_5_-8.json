They contend that biblical authority requires accepting these texts as normative across cultures and that the consistent witness of church history supports this reading.\n\n## The Affirming/Progressive View\n\nProponents argue that the biblical passages address exploitative practices (pederasty, temple prostitution, excess) rather than loving, committed relationships unknown in the ancient world. They emphasize Scripture's trajectory toward inclusion (Galatians 3:28), Jesus's welcome of the marginalized, and that biblical authority has previously been reconciled with changing positions on slavery, women's roles, and divorce.\n\n## The Honest Tensions\n\nBoth sides face genuine challenges:\n- **Traditionalists** must explain how their hermeneutic differs from past defenses of slavery\n- **Progressives** must demonstrate they're not simply accommodating culture over text\n\n## My Assessment\n\nChristians of evident faith, biblical seriousness, and intellectual integrity exist on both sides.

It foregrounds two major positions (Traditional/Conservative and Affirming/Progressive), summarizes their biblical arguments, and then explicitly discusses genuine tensions on both sides. The assessment emphasizes that Christians on both sides show faithfulness and intellectual seriousness, framing the issue as interpretive complexity rather than a clear, dogmatic closure. It also invites reader discernment (asking what matters to you and presenting four evaluative questions), further signaling humility and openness to legitimate diversity rather than advancing a decisive stance. Overall, it acknowledges diversity and avoids dogmatic rhetoric while fairly presenting alternatives."
