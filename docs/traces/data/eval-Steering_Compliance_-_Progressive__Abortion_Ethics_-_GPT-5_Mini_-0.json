    "input": "Is abortion always morally wrong, or are there circumstances where it's acceptable?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Short answer: No — many philosophers, ethicists and people of faith hold that abortion is not always morally wrong. Whether it is acceptable depends on which moral principles you prioritize (e.g., the moral status of the embryo/fetus, the pregnant person’s bodily autonomy, harms and benefits) and on the circumstances.\n\nKey considerations and common positions\n\n- The “always wrong” view\n  - Often grounded in the claim that a human embryo/fetus has full moral status (personhood) from conception, so intentionally ending it is equivalent to killing an innocent person.\n  - Frequently rooted in religious convictions about the sanctity of human life.\n  - Leads to absolutist moral and legal opposition to nearly all abortions.\n\n- The “sometimes permissible” view\n  - Emphasizes the pregnant person’s bodily autonomy and moral agency: you cannot be forced to use your body to sustain another being.\n  - Recognizes serious competing moral claims (health, life, wellbeing of the pregnant person).\n  - Allows abortion in cases such as threat to the pregnant person’s life or health, severe fetal anomaly incompatible with life, pregnancy from rape or incest, or when forced continuation would cause major harm (economic, psychological, social).\n  - Can be grounded in consequentialist reasoning (minimizing overall suffering), rights-based arguments, or public-health considerations.\n\n- The “gradualist” view\n  - Moral status of the embryo/fetus increases over time. Early abortions are generally more permissible than late-term ones, while later-term abortions may only be justified for very serious reasons (maternal health, severe anomalies).\n  - Tries to balance respect for fetal development with respecting the pregnant person’s autonomy.\n\n- Practical and medical considerations\n  - Many people accept exceptions at minimum where the pregnant person’s life is at risk, or where continuing the pregnancy would cause grave harm.\n  - Medical practice commonly distinguishes between early abortion and late-term procedures and between elective vs medically necessary abortions.\n  - Viability and fetal development can inform judgments but are not decisive on their own.\n\nHow to think about the question\n- Identify which moral claims you find strongest: is the embryo/fetus a person with full rights? Is bodily autonomy central? Can harms to the pregnant person (health, life, severe hardship) outweigh the claim of the fetus?\n- Consider stage of pregnancy and factual medical information about risks and prognosis.\n- Recognize moral uncertainty and pluralism: reasonable people differ, and public policy often tries to balance competing rights and protect individuals most at risk.\n\nConclusion\nThere is no single philosophical consensus. Some people (and many religious traditions) hold abortion is always morally wrong; many others judge it morally permissible in a range of circumstances, especially where the pregnant person’s life, health, or autonomy is at stake. A thoughtful position explains which ethical principles you prioritize and why, and it recognizes difficult trade-offs in particular cases.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Explain arguments from a specific ethical framework (utilitarian, deontological, virtue ethics).\n- Lay out how particular scenarios (rape, life-threatening pregnancy, severe fetal anomaly, socioeconomic reasons) are treated by different moral theories.\n- Suggest resources for further reading.",
