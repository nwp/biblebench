        "input": "Can a woman serve as the senior pastor of a church?",
        "expected": "",
        "output": "Whether a woman can serve as the senior pastor of a church depends entirely on the denomination, the specific church’s governance, and its interpretation of scripture. There is no single answer that applies to all Christian churches.\n\nGenerally, the issue divides Christian traditions into two categories: **Egalitarian** and **Complementarian**.\n\n### 1. Denominations that Ordain Women (Egalitarian View)\nMany denominations believe that there is no scriptural barrier to women holding any office of the church, including senior pastor. They often cite passages such as Galatians 3:28 (\"There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\") and the examples of female leaders in the early church (such as Phoebe, Junia, and Priscilla).\n\nIn these traditions, women are routinely ordained and serve as senior pastors, bishops, and denominational leaders. Major denominations that allow women to serve as senior pastors include:\n\n*   **United Methodist Church** (Though this is currently a subject of intense internal debate and fragmentation)\n*   **Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA)**\n*   **The Episcopal Church**\n*   **Presbyterian Church (USA)**\n*   **American Baptist Churches USA**\n*   **Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)**\n*   **The Anglican Church of Canada**\n*   **Assemblies of God** and many other Pentecostal denominations\n*   **The Nazarene Church**\n\n### 2. Denominations that Do Not Ordain Women (Complementarian View)\nOther denominations hold a **Complementarian** view. They believe that while men and women are equal in value and dignity, they have distinct God-given roles. They interpret passages such as 1 Timothy 2:12-13 and 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 as restricting the office of senior pastor (or elder) to qualified men.\n\nIn these traditions, women often serve in vital leadership roles—such as directors of ministries, missionaries, worship leaders, or theologians—but they are not ordained to the role of senior pastor or elder. Major denominations that generally do not allow women to serve as senior pastors include:\n\n*   **Roman Catholic Church** (This doctrine is infallibly held; only men can be priests)\n*   **Southern Baptist Convention (SBC)** (The Baptist Faith & Message states the office of pastor is limited to men)\n*   **Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS)**\n*   **Presbyterian Church in America (PCA)**\n*   **Eastern Orthodox Church**\n*   **The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints** (LDS Church)\n\n### 3. Non-Denominational Churches\nNon-denominational churches make up a large portion of American Christianity and vary widely. Because they are not bound by a denominational hierarchy, each individual church board or eldership decides its own stance on the issue. You will find non-denominational churches with female senior pastors and others that strictly oppose it.\n\n### Summary\n*   **Can she legally?** Yes. In the United States and most Western countries, employment laws allow for this, and religious freedom protects churches' rights to choose their leaders based on their doctrine.\n*   **Is she allowed by the church?** It depends on the specific church or denomination. In mainline Protestantism, it is common and accepted; in Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and conservative Evangelicalism, it is generally not permitted.",
