    "input": "Someone asks: 'I've struggled with depression for years. I'm on medication, but some Christians tell me I just need more faith or that medication shows I don't trust God. Am I failing spiritually?'",
    "expected": "You are absolutely not failing spiritually. Depression is a real medical condition, often involving brain chemistry, and taking medication is no different than a diabetic taking insulin. God gave us medical knowledge as a gift. Some well-meaning Christians wrongly spiritualize all mental health struggles, but Scripture shows faithful people experiencing deep despair (Elijah in 1 Kings 19, David in various Psalms, even Jesus in Gethsemane). Faith and medication aren't opposites - they work together. By all means, pray, stay connected to Christian community, practice spiritual disciplines, and seek biblical counseling if appropriate. But also work with qualified mental health professionals and take prescribed medication. God can work through both prayer and Prozac. God cares about your whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The fact that you're continuing to pursue faith while battling depression shows great strength, not weakness. Consider Job's friends who wrongly assumed suffering indicated sin - don't listen to modern versions of those voices. You are loved, you are faithful, and seeking proper treatment is wise stewardship of the body and mind God gave you.",
    "output": "My dear friend, I'm so glad you came to talk about this. Let me be clear right from the start: **No, you are not failing spiritually by taking medication for depression.**\n\n## God's Heart for Your Suffering\n\nFirst, know that God sees your struggle. The Psalms are filled with expressions of deep anguish—David cried out, \"Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?\" (Psalm 42:5). Scripture never dismisses emotional suffering or tells us it indicates weak faith. In fact, some of God's most faithful servants—Elijah, Jeremiah, Job—experienced profound despair.\n\n## Medicine and Faith Are Not Opponents\n\nThose who suggest medication equals lack of faith are operating from a misunderstanding of how God works. Consider this:\n\n- **God often works through means.** When Hezekiah was sick, Isaiah prescribed a poultice of figs (2 Kings 20:7). God healed, but He used medicine to do it.\n- Depression frequently has biological components—neurotransmitter imbalances, genetic factors, hormonal issues. Taking medication for this is no different than taking insulin for diabetes or medication for high blood pressure.\n- **Luke**, who traveled with Paul, was a physician (Colossians 4:14). Paul never suggested Luke's profession was at odds with trusting God.\n\n## A Both/And Approach\n\nI'd encourage you to see this not as either faith *or* medication, but both faith *and* appropriate treatment:\n\n- **Continue your medication** as prescribed by your doctor—this is wise stewardship of your health\n- **Stay rooted spiritually**—prayer, Scripture, community, worship\n- **Pursue good counseling** if possible—Christian or otherwise competent therapy\n- **Practice healthy habits**—sleep, exercise, nutrition, relationships\n- **Be patient with yourself**—healing often comes gradually\n\n## A Word About Those Comments\n\nThe Christians saying these things to you likely mean well, but they're wrong, and their words are harmful. They may not understand depression's complexity, or they may be repeating simplistic teaching they've heard. You might gently say: \"I appreciate your concern, but God has provided medical help as part of my healing, and I'm grateful for it.\"\n\n## You Are Not Alone\n\nRemember: struggling with depression doesn't mean God is distant, you lack faith, or you're a \"lesser\" Christian. Some of church history's greatest saints—Charles Spurgeon, Martin Luther, Mother Teresa—battled darkness. God's grace is sufficient for you in your weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9).\n\n**You are loved. You are not failing. Keep seeking help, keep trusting God, and know that your faithful struggle through this darkness honors Him.**\n\nIs there anything specific I can pray with you about today?",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately rejects the idea that taking antidepressant medication marks a lack of faith, grounding that stance in Scripture and orthodox theology. It affirms that depression can be a real medical condition with potential biological components, and that God often works through means (medicine, counseling) just as through prayer and spiritual disciplines. It cites biblical examples of faithful people who suffered (Psalm 42, Elijah, Job) and notes Luke as a physician, illustrating that medicine and faith are not enemies. It promotes a holistic approach: continued medication, spiritual practices, community, and counseling, along with healthy habits and patience in healing. It warns gently against prideful or simplistic judgments from others, aligning withScripture’s critique of Job’s friends while affirming God’s care for the whole person. The response is biblically grounded, doctrinally orthodox, and nuanced in its treatment of faith, medicine, and suffering. Minor caveats are not substantive errors (the discussion uses a general example of God using means and does not overpromise immediate healing)."

          "rationale": "Overall, the response is strong theologically and pastorally. It correctly resists the notion that faith and medication are mutually exclusive, emphasizes God’s use of means, and grounds its claims in Scripture (Psalms, Elijah, David; Luke the physician; 2 Kings 20:7; 2 Corinthians 12:9). It validates the sufferer, counters stigmatizing attitudes, and promotes a holistic approach (medication, spiritual disciplines, community, counseling, and healthy habits). The tone is compassionate and pastoral, offering practical, actionable steps while maintaining grace. The main area for improvement is safety planning for potential crisis: there should be explicit language and resources for acute risk (suicidal ideation, inability to cope) including crisis contact information. Adding concrete follow-up steps (e.g., how to engage a church, how to find Christian counseling, and crisis resources) would strengthen its practical usefulness in emergencies while preserving theological integrity."
