    "input": "A teacher says: 'Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine - he was adopted as God's son at his baptism.' Is this teaching orthodox or heretical? Explain.",
    "expected": "This is heretical. It represents Adoptionism, which claims Jesus became God's son at some point (often his baptism) rather than being eternally the Son of God. Orthodox Christianity teaches that Jesus is the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, who has always been fully divine. John 1:1 affirms 'the Word was God' from the beginning, and Jesus is that Word made flesh.",
    "output": "**Short answer:**  \nThe teacher’s statement is **heretical**.  It is the classic ancient heresy known as **Adoptionism** (or “dynamic Monarchianism”), which denies the eternal divinity of the Son and teaches that Jesus became God’s Son only at his baptism.  This teaching is expressly rejected by the historic, ecumenical creeds and by the confessional doctrine of the Trinity and the Incarnation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the statement asserts\n\n> “Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, but he was not truly divine – he was adopted as God’s Son at his baptism.”\n\nKey propositions:\n\n1. **Jesus is not truly divine.**  \n2. **Jesus becomes the Son of God only at a point in time** (the baptism).\n\nBoth points contradict the core Christian confession that the Son is **eternally** divine, **begotten** of the Father, and **incarnate** from the moment of the Logos’ pre‑existence.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the teaching is outside orthodoxy\n\n### 2.1. The doctrine of the Trinity and the eternal Son\n\n* **Biblical foundation**  \n  - **John 1:1‑3, 14** – “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God… The Word became flesh.”  \n  - **John 5:18** – “the Son… could not do anything by himself… because he was not God.” (the Jews understood that the Son *was* God).  \n  - **Hebrews 1:3** – the Son “upholds all things by the word of his power. He is the exact imprint of the deity.”  \n  - **Colossians 1:15‑17** – the Son is “the image of the invisible God… by him all things were created.”\n\n* **Creedal affirmation**  \n  - **Nicene Creed (325 / 381)**: “We believe in one Lord Jesus Christ… *begotten, not made*, consubstantial (of one substance) with the Father.”  \n  - **Chalcedonian Definition (451)**: Christ is “truly God and truly man, one and the same Son… who is perfect in his divinity and perfect in his humanity.”\n\nThe creed’s language **“begotten, not made”** directly contradicts any notion that the Son was *created* or *adopted* at a later date.\n\n### 2.2. The historic heresy of Adoptionism\n\n| Name | Key idea | Time/Proponent | Verdict |\n|------|----------|----------------|---------|\n| **Adoptionism (Dynamic Monarchianism)** | Jesus was a purely human who was *adopted* as the Son of God at his baptism (or at his resurrection) | 2nd‑3rd c., e.g., Theodotus of Byzantium, Paul of Samosata | Condemned at the **Council of Nicaea** (325) and later synods; anathematized by Irenaeus, Tertullian, Hippolytus, and the Cappadocian Fathers. |\n| **Arianism** (different but related) | The Son is a created being, inferior to the Father | 4th c., Arius | Also condemned at Nicaea. |\n\nAdoptionism is therefore a well‑known **heretical** position, distinct from the orthodox doctrine of the *eternal* Son.\n\n### 2.3. What orthodox Christology says about baptism\n\n* Baptism **does not* make Jesus the Son of God; it *proclaims* what is already true.  \n* The New Testament presents the baptism as **anthetic** (John 1:29‑34: “Behold the Lamb of God… I have baptized him…”).  \n* The **Council of Chalcedon** (451) described the Incarnation as a *hypostatic union*: the divine Logos and the human Jesus unite “from the moment of the incarnation,” not at a later sacrament.\n\nThus, placing the *origin* of divinity at baptism is a **theological reversal** of the biblical and creedal witness.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why the teaching is dangerous for the Christian faith\n\n1. **Undermines the uniqueness of Christ.** If Jesus is merely a great prophet who becomes a son by adoption, he does not possess the divine authority to forgive sins, give eternal life, or be the perfect mediator (1 Tim 2:5; Heb 9:14).  \n2. **Destroys the basis of the atonement.** A non‑divine Christ cannot bear the full penalty of God’s wrath (Heb 9:22; 1 John 2:2).  \n3. **Destroys the doctrine of the Trinity.** The relational distinction between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is grounded on the Son’s eternal deity. Adoptionism collapses that relational structure into a *father‑son* hierarchy that resembles a pagan monotheism rather than Trinitarianism.  \n\nThese consequences were precisely why the early church fathers and ecumenical councils **excommunicated** adoptionist teachers—they threatened the very heart of the gospel.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary verdict\n\n- **The teacher’s statement** → “Jesus is a great prophet, not truly divine, adopted at baptism.”\n- **Classification** → **Heretical (Adoptionism / Dynamic Monarchianism).**\n- **Reason** → It denies the eternal deity of the Son, contradicts Scripture (John 1, Colossians 1, Hebrews 1), violates the Nicene‑Chalcedonian Christological formulae, and follows a condemned ancient heresy.\n\nAnyone holding to this view is outside **orthodox Christianity** and would be required, according to historic Christian teaching, to repudiate the doctrine and accept the truth of the Incarnation as defined by the ecumenical creeds.",

            "The historical-note in 2.2 stating Adoptionism was condemned at the Council of Nicaea (325) is an oversimplification. Nicaea primarily addressed Arianism and the nature of the Son’s divinity; Adoptionism (dynamic monarchianism) was rejected by earlier church fathers (e.g., Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Tertullian) and by subsequent councils, but tying its condemnation chiefly to Nicaea glosses over the nuanced historic development.",

          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies Adoptionism as the heretical view and roots the orthodox position in Scripture (e.g., John 1, Colossians 1, Hebrews 1) and creedal formulas. It appropriately notes the explicit danger such a view poses to the doctrine of the Trinity and the atonement. However, the response contains a historical oversimplification (Nicaea’s role vs. earlier condemnations) and a verse-interpretation nuance in John 5:18, which should be clarified to avoid implying the Jews taught Jesus was God rather than recognizing his claim to equality with God."
