            "Historical claim that the Council of Nicaea explicitly condemned Adoptionism is inaccurate; Nicaea primarily condemned Arianism and defined the divinity of the Son, whereas Adoptionism (adoptionist views) was addressed by later Fathers and councils.",
            "The statement that the Holy Spirit 'adopted' Jesus at baptism is not the standard or precise formulation of Adoptionism; traditional Adoptionism is described as Jesus being adopted as the Son by God (often at baptism), with varying formulations about the role of the Father or Spirit. The wording here could mislead about who performs the adoption.",
            "While the response correctly argues that Adoptionism contradicts orthodox teaching, it could more explicitly distinguish between the eternal pre-existence of the Son and the personal occasions of revelation/commission (e.g., baptism) without implying divinization occurs at baptism in orthodox terms."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM correctly identifies Adoptionism as heretical and affirms orthodox Christology (eternal divinity of the Son, incarnation as the Word made flesh). It grounds its claims in Scripture (John 1:1; Colossians 1:15-17) and notes the central doctrinal points about the Incarnation and the Trinity. The main historiographical inaccuracy is the claim that Nicaea explicitly condemned Adoptionism; Adoptionism was more fully condemned by later authorities, and Nicea’s Creed targeted Arius and the nature of the Son rather than adopting a formal condemnation of Adoptionism per se. The phrasing about the Spirit’s role in adoption is also imprecise. Overall, the answer is strong and doctrinally sound, with minor historical nuances needing correction."
