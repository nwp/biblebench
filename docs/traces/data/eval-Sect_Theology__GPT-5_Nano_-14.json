    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "Short answer\nGroups that use Christian language and claim to follow Jesus are considered outside orthodox Christianity when they deny or radically redefine the core doctrines that have been confessed by the historic Christian churches in the ancient creeds and councils. The line is not drawn by preference or sentiment about Jesus alone, but by whether essential Christian truth about God, Christ, salvation, the Bible, and the church remains intact.\n\nHow orthodox Christianity defines “orthodox”\n- The rule of faith: Orthodox Christians confess the central truths handed down in the early creeds (Nicene, Apostles’, Chalcedonian, etc.). These creeds summarize what Christians have universally held about God and the gospel.\n- The Triune God: One God in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—fully God, fully united in one essence.\n- Christology: Jesus Christ is truly God and truly human, without confusion or mixture; the hypostatic union (two natures in one person) is preserved.\n- The atonement and resurrection: Christ’s death and resurrection accomplish deliverance for sinners; salvation is by grace through faith in Christ.\n- Scripture and tradition: Scripture is the inspired, authoritative word of God; tradition (as the Church has always taught and handed down) helps interpret and preserve that word. For Catholic and Orthodox Christians, this includes a lived tradition and, in their self-understanding, apostolic succession; Protestants typically emphasize Scripture as the supreme rule of faith, but still affirm the historic creeds.\n- The Church and the sacraments: The Church is a continuing, visible fellowship of faith; baptism and the Eucharist (and, in many traditions, other sacraments or rites) are means of grace and signs of incorporation into Christ.\n- Eschatology and the gospel core: The hope of new creation, the final judgment, and the rightful place of Christ’s lordship over all things.\n\nWhat counts as departure from orthodoxy (red flags)\n- Denial or radical revision of the Trinity. For example, teaching that the Father, Son, and Spirit are not distinct persons or that only one person of God exists in certain modes.\n- Denial of the full divinity or full humanity of Jesus, or teaching a fundamentally altered Christology (e.g., denying the incarnation, denying the atonement’s substitutionary aspect, etc.).\n- Denial of the canonical status of Scripture or the acceptance of new scriptures that contradict the historic canon or the apostolic gospel.\n- Denial of the resurrection or denial of the universal need for, and sufficiency of, Christ’s atonement.\n- Elevation of additional revelation that supersedes or contradicts the historic rule of faith (often accompanied by claims of being the only true church).\n- Denial or drastic redefinition of the church’s identity, baptism, and the Eucharist (e.g., invalid sacraments, or treating baptism as merely symbolic with no grace, contrary to the historic view).\n- Universalism or other soteriologies that erase the need for grace, faith in Christ, repentance, or judgment in a way that contradicts the gospel.\n- Elevating human authority or new, exclusive claims of salvation outside the community of faith defined by apostolic teaching.\n\nWhere the line is drawn (practical criteria)\n- Doctrinal non-negotiables (basis for orthodoxy)\n  - Is the Trinity confessed in a way consistent with the creeds?\n  - Is the person of Christ confessed as fully God and fully man?\n  - Is the gospel’s central claim preserved: sin, grace, faith in Christ, the cross, the resurrection, and new creation?\n  - Is the authority of Scripture affirmed as the Word of God, with the canon upheld and interpreted within the historic faith?\n- Ecclesial and apostolic continuity\n  - Is there a credible claim to apostolic teaching and continuity (or, in Catholic/Orthodox terms, apostolic succession and communion with the historic church)?\n  - Do the group’s practices (baptism, Eucharist, other rites) align with how historic churches understood them to convey grace and signify inclusion in the body of Christ?\n- Consistency with ecumenical norms\n  - Do they reject the core creedal boundaries that separate Christian faith from other religions or from heretical positions of the ancient world?\n  - Do they claim to be the only true church in a way that denies the legitimacy or validity of other Christians who hold to orthodox confession?\n\nExamples to illustrate the line\n- Jehovah’s Witnesses: Deny the Trinity, teach Jesus is a created being, reinterpret key gospel doctrines. By classical standards, this places them outside orthodox Christian confessions.\n- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons): Add new scriptures and teach distinct doctrines about the Godhead that diverge from historic Trinitarian orthodoxy; claim a different gospel pathway. This is typically categorized as outside orthodox Christianity.\n- Oneness or Modalist Pentecostals: Deny the traditional three-person doctrine of the Trinity, holding to a non-trinitarian view. This diverges from orthodox creedal teaching.\n- Certain groups that claim new revelation or new scripture that overturns the canonical canon: such claims are a common reason for being considered outside orthodoxy, regardless of how Christian language is used.\n\nAreas of agreement with orthodox Christianity\n- Many groups that are labeled outside orthodox Christianity still share common ground with orthodox Christians on several fronts:\n  - Acknowledging Jesus as a central figure and teacher.\n  - Affirming basic moral teachings and the importance of faith or devotion.\n  - Recognizing some form of divine revelation or scripture as authoritative.\n- The point of disagreement, from an orthodox Christian perspective, is whether key doctrines about God, Christ, salvation, and Scripture are preserved or overturned.\n\nHow to approach evaluating groups respectfully and rigorously\n- Listen carefully to their core doctrinal claims about God, Christ, salvation, Scripture, and the church.\n- Compare those claims to the historic creeds and to the gospel proclaimed in the New Testament.\n- Distinguish between primary (non-negotiable) and secondary (negotiable or clarifiable) issues.\n- Consider not only belief but practice: baptism, Eucharist, and the life of the church, and whether their self-understanding aligns with apostolic teaching.\n- Recognize that “orthodoxy” exists within a family of traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, and many Protestant confessions) that share core beliefs, even if they differ on non-essentials.\n\nBottom line\nOrthodoxy in the traditional sense is defined by fidelity to the historic apostolic faith as summarized in the creeds: a Trinitarian God, a fully divine and fully human Jesus, salvation by grace through faith in Christ, the authority and canon of Scripture, and the Church as the body of Christ with its sacraments. Groups that decisively depart from these non-negotiables, or that claim new revelation that overturns them, are generally regarded as outside orthodox Christianity. The line is drawn at the level of these core doctrines, with room for legitimate theological diversity on non-essentials within the broad Christian family.",

          "rationale": "The LLM response accurately reflects historic orthodox criteria: the Trinity, the full deity and humanity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, the authority of Scripture, the physical resurrection, and the expectation of Christ’s return. It correctly locates “orthodoxy” in adherence to the creeds (Apostles’, Nicene, Chalcedonian) and identifies red flags when essential doctrines are denied or radically reinterpreted (e.g., denial of the Trinity, denial of Jesus’ incarnation/atonement, denial of Scripture’s canonical status, or the introduction of new, superseding revelation). It also presents practical criteria (doctrinal non-negotiables, apostolic continuity, continuity with historic church practices) and gives concrete examples (Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, Oneness Pentecostals) that illustrate where lines are drawn. The answer acknowledges legitimate differences on non-essentials and the varied ways churches understand tradition, baptism, and the sacraments, which shows nuanced understanding of intra-Christian diversity. \n\nPotential caveats (not errors, but worth noting):\n- In stating criteria such as apostolic succession as part of orthodox continuity, the response reflects a Catholic/Orthodox emphasis. Some Protestant confessions affirm creedal orthodoxy without formal apostolic succession in the same sense; the line between orthodoxy and heterodoxy is debated in Protestant contexts, so the criterion should be framed as “credible apostolic teaching and continuity” rather than universal dependence on apostolic succession alone.\n- The treatment of sacraments as “means of grace” is broadly accurate for Catholic/Orthodox traditions and many Protestant traditions alike, but some Protestant groups view sacraments more as ordinances or symbols rather than means of grace, which could be clarified for precision. \n\nOverall, the answer is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded in its alignment with historic creedal teaching, and nuanced in recognizing intra-Christian diversity on non-essentials.
