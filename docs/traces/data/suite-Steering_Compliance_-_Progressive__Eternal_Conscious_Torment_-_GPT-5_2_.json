        "output": "Different Christian traditions answer this differently. “Eternal conscious torment” (often abbreviated **ECT**) is a major view, but it is not the only one held by Bible‑affirming Christians. Here are the three main positions and the kinds of biblical texts each emphasizes.\n\n## 1) Eternal conscious torment (ECT): **Yes**\n**Claim:** Unbelievers will be consciously punished forever.\n\n**Common biblical support cited:**\n- **Matthew 25:46** – “eternal punishment” contrasted with “eternal life.”\n- **Mark 9:43–48** – imagery of unquenchable fire and “their worm does not die.”\n- **Revelation 14:9–11** – “the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever… no rest.”\n- **Revelation 20:10, 14–15** – lake of fire; “tormented day and night forever and ever” (explicitly said of the devil; many infer similar for the lost).\n\n**How advocates read the language:** “Eternal” refers to the ongoing duration of punishment, not merely its results.\n\n**Who holds it:** Historically dominant in Western Christianity (many Catholics and Protestants; also in many evangelical traditions).\n\n## 2) Annihilationism / Conditional immortality: **No (not forever conscious)**\n**Claim:** The unsaved will face judgment and punishment, but ultimately be **destroyed** (cease to exist); the punishment is “eternal” in its *effect* (irreversible), not in ongoing conscious experience.\n\n**Common biblical support cited:**\n- **Matthew 10:28** – God can “destroy both soul and body in hell.”\n- **Romans 6:23** – “wages of sin is death.”\n- **2 Thessalonians 1:9** – “eternal destruction.”\n- **John 3:16** – the alternative to eternal life is “perish.”\n- Language of consuming fire, destruction, chaff burned up (e.g., **Malachi 4:1–3**).\n\n**How advocates read the language:** “Death,” “perish,” and “destroy” are taken more literally as the end of the person, not eternal conscious life in misery.\n\n**Who holds it:** Some evangelicals and groups like Seventh‑day Adventists; also some Anglican and other theologians.\n\n## 3) Universal reconciliation (Christian universalism): **Ultimately, no (not eternal for anyone)**\n**Claim:** God will finally restore all people; hell/judgment may be real and severe, but **not everlasting** for any person.\n\n**Common biblical support cited:**\n- **1 Timothy 2:4** – God “desires all people to be saved.”\n- **1 Corinthians 15:22–28** – ultimately God will be “all in all.”\n- **Colossians 1:19–20** – reconciliation of “all things.”\n- **Romans 5:18** – a parallel between Adam’s condemnation and Christ’s righteousness.\n\n**How advocates read the “eternal” texts:** Some argue the Greek *aiōnios* can mean “age‑long,” or that images of fire are purgative/refining rather than endlessly retributive.\n\n**Who holds it:** A minority position historically, though found in some early Christian thinkers and in some modern theologians.\n\n---\n\n## So will unbelievers experience eternal conscious torment?\n- **If you’re asking what many churches teach:** **Many do teach ECT.**\n- **If you’re asking whether Christianity has a single settled answer across all traditions:** **No.** Faithful Christians disagree, mainly over how to interpret “eternal,” the nature of “destruction,” and apocalyptic imagery (especially in Revelation).\n\nIf you tell me your background (e.g., evangelical Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, “just reading the Bible,” etc.) or which passages are most on your mind, I can show how that tradition typically reads the key texts and why.",
