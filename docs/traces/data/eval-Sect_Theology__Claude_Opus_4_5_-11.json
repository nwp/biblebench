    "expected": "No, this is the ancient heresy of modalism (also called Sabellianism), which was condemned by the early church. Orthodox Christianity teaches that God is one being eternally existing as three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Biblical evidence for their simultaneous distinct existence includes Jesus' baptism (Matthew 3:16-17) where the Son is baptized, the Spirit descends, and the Father speaks - all at the same time. Jesus prays to the Father (John 17), showing personal relationship between persons. The apostolic blessing (2 Corinthians 13:14) distinguishes three persons. Modalism was rejected because it cannot account for the relationships within the Godhead and makes Jesus' prayers to the Father nonsensical.",
    "output": "# Theological Analysis: Oneness Pentecostalism and the Doctrine of God\n\n## The Teaching Summarized\n\nOneness Pentecostalism (also called \"Jesus Only\" or Apostolic Pentecostalism) teaches that God is absolutely one *person* who has revealed Himself in different *modes* or *manifestations* throughout salvation history—as Father in creation, as Son in redemption, and as Holy Spirit in regeneration. They typically affirm that Jesus Christ is the fullness of the Godhead and that baptism should be performed \"in Jesus' name\" only.\n\n---\n\n## Orthodox Assessment: **This is not orthodox Christian theology**\n\nThis position represents a modern form of **Modalism** (also called Sabellianism or Modalistic Monarchianism), which was explicitly rejected by the early church in the 3rd-4th centuries.\n\n### Why the Church Rejected Modalism\n\n**1. Biblical Evidence for Simultaneous Distinction**\n- At Jesus' baptism, the Father speaks from heaven, the Son is in the water, and the Spirit descends—simultaneously (Matthew 3:16-17)\n- Jesus prays *to* the Father as a genuine \"Other\" (John 17)\n- Jesus speaks of the Father sending \"another Helper\" (John 14:16)—the word *allos* meaning \"another of the same kind\"\n\n**2. Relational Language Becomes Incoherent**\nIf God is one person in three modes, then Jesus praying to the Father becomes God talking to Himself in a theatrical sense, undermining the genuine relational intimacy Scripture portrays.\n\n**3. The Ecumenical Creeds**\nThe Nicene Creed (325/381 AD) and Athanasian Creed explicitly affirm three *distinct persons* (Greek: *hypostases*; Latin: *personae*) sharing one divine *essence* (*ousia*). The Athanasian Creed states: \"We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance.\"\n\n---\n\n## Points of Agreement with Orthodoxy\n\nTo be fair, Oneness Pentecostals are attempting to preserve important truths:\n- **Monotheism**: There is only one God (Deuteronomy 6:4)\n- **The full deity of Christ**: Jesus is truly God, not a lesser being\n- **The rejection of tritheism**: Christians do not worship three gods\n\nThese concerns are legitimate, and orthodox Trinitarianism affirms all of them.\n\n---\n\n## The Crucial Distinction\n\n| Oneness View | Orthodox Trinity |\n|--------------|------------------|\n| One person, three modes | Three persons, one essence |\n| Sequential or functional manifestations | Eternal, simultaneous relations |\n| Father, Son, Spirit = roles God plays | Father, Son, Spirit = who God eternally *is* |\n\n---\n\n## Respectful Conclusion\n\nOneness Pentecostals are sincere believers seeking to honor Christ's deity and biblical monotheism. However, their doctrine formally departs from the Trinitarian orthodoxy affirmed by Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions alike. The church fathers did not reject Modalism from philosophical speculation but from careful attention to how Scripture presents the Father, Son, and Spirit in genuine, eternal relationship with one another.\n\nThe orthodox position maintains that God is not *sometimes* Father and *sometimes* Son—He is eternally, simultaneously, and irreducibly three persons in one undivided Being.",

          "rationale": "The LLM accurately identifies Oneness Pentecostalism as a modalistic (Sabellian) position and notes its rejection by historic orthodox teaching. It correctly asserts that orthodox Christianity affirms one God in three distinct, eternal, and simultaneous persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) who share one essence, supported by key biblical passages (e.g., Matthew 3:16–17; John 17; John 14:16; 2 Corinthians 13:14). The response acknowledges legitimate orthodox concerns (monotheism, full deity of Christ, rejection of tritheism) and provides helpful nuance about relational distinctions and the problem modalism poses for biblical language about praying, intra-divine relationship, and the economy of salvation. It also mentions creedal affirmations (Nicene, Athanasian) relevant to the doctrine. Minor caveats are rare but the core points are sound and align well with classical Protestant/Catholic/Orthodox orthodoxy. Overall, the answer is doctrinally solid, biblically grounded, and nuanced.}"
