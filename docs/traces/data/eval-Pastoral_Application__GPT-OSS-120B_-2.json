    "expected": "I appreciate you asking this question honestly. Scripture consistently reserves sexual intimacy for marriage (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This isn't arbitrary - God designed sex to be protected within the covenant of marriage, which provides security, commitment, and public accountability that 'being committed' alone doesn't provide. Cultural acceptance doesn't change biblical standards. That said, I want to encourage you: if you're truly committed to each other and to following Christ, why not honor that commitment through marriage? If you're not ready for marriage, that suggests you're not ready for the level of intimacy you're already sharing. God's commands aren't meant to deprive us but to protect us and lead us to flourishing. I'd encourage you to talk with a pastor or counselor about either moving toward marriage or, difficult as it may be, living separately until marriage. This is about discipleship and honoring God with your bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), not about judgment.",
    "output": "**Grace and Peace to You Both,**\n\nFirst, thank you for coming to the Lord with a question that is weighing on your hearts.  It takes humility and love to bring a sensitive issue before a pastor, and the fact that you are seeking God’s wisdom together shows that you already have a good foundation for what the Spirit calls a “God‑centered” relationship (Eph 5:21).\n\n---\n\n### 1. What the Bible Says About Sex and Marriage  \n\n| Scripture | Key Point |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| **Genesis 2:24** – “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife…” | The biblical picture of intimacy is **covenantal** – a bond that begins at marriage. |\n| **Hebrews 13:4** – “Let marriage be held in honor among all, and the marriage bed be undefiled.” | The “marriage bed” is set apart for the married couple; sexual activity outside that covenant is called “undefiled” (i.e., not pure). |\n| **1 Corinthians 6:18‑20** – “Flee from sexual immorality… your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit.” | Sexual immorality (Greek *porneia*) includes any sexual activity outside the marriage covenant. Our bodies belong to Christ, not to personal desire. |\n| **1 Thessalonians 4:3‑5** – “God’s will … is that you be holy … that you keep yourselves pure.” | God’s will for every believer is sexual purity—self‑control and holiness. |\n| **Ephesians 5:31‑33** – “A man shall leave… and be united to his wife” (quoting Genesis). The mystery of Christ and the church is mirrored in marriage. | Marital intimacy reflects the intimate, exclusive relationship between Christ and the church. |\n\nTaken together, the New Testament consistently presents **sex as a gift to be enjoyed within marriage**, not as a cultural concession or “just another option.”  When a couple lives together without being married, the sexual intimacy they share is outside the covenant that God designed to protect and bless it.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Why “Everyone Does It” Isn’t a Biblical Standard  \n\nThe apostle Paul warned the early church (and we today) about conforming to the surrounding culture:  \n\n> “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind” (Romans 12:2).\n\nCulture can shift rapidly—what was once scandalous is now “normal.”  The fact that many people cohabit is **a cultural trend, not a divine endorsement**.  When we base our moral compass on what “everyone does,” we risk substituting **human opinion for God’s Word** (Proverbs 14:12).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Grace, Not Condemnation  \n\nGod does not delight in sin, but He delights even more in a repentant heart.  Remember:\n\n> “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).\n\nYou are not beyond the reach of God’s grace.  The very fact that you are asking this question shows a **godly concern** for what is right.  Christ invites us into a **new identity**—a life marked not by past patterns but by the transformative power of the Holy Spirit (2 Cor 5:17).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Practical Steps Toward a God‑Honoring Relationship  \n\n1. **Prayerful Decision**  \n   - Set aside time each day to pray **together** for God’s guidance. Ask Him to give you clarity about what His will looks like for your future and the strength to obey it.\n\n2. **Seek Accountability**  \n   - Find a trusted older couple or a small‑group within your church that can walk alongside you. Accountability isn’t about control; it’s about loving encouragement (James 5:16).\n\n3. **Outline a Timeline for Marriage**  \n   - If you are truly committed, consider **setting a concrete, realistic timeframe** for marriage (e.g., within the next 12–18 months). This demonstrates seriousness and respects the biblical covenant.\n\n4. **Engage in Premarital Counseling**  \n   - Most churches offer a premarital course that covers biblical foundations of marriage, finances, communication, and sexual intimacy. This preparation equips you to enter marriage stronger (Eph 4:2‑3).\n\n5. **Establish Boundaries While Living Together**  \n   - If you feel compelled to stay under the same roof (perhaps for financial or familial reasons), **set clear physical and emotional boundaries** that honor God’s call to sexual purity (e.g., separate bedrooms, limited alone‑time). This is not a “temporary compromise,” but a **practical guard** while you work toward marriage.\n\n6. **Invest in the Body of Christ**  \n   - Regularly attend corporate worship, serve in ministries, and be part of a community that encourages holiness. The church is the “great cloud of witnesses” (Heb 12:1) that will cheer you on as you pursue a marriage that glorifies God.\n\n---\n\n### 5. What If You Choose a Different Path?  \n\nShould you decide, after prayer and counsel, that you will not marry each other, it is still possible to honor God:\n\n- **Live a chaste lifestyle** (1 Cor 6:18);  \n- **Maintain transparency** with your church to avoid scandal (1 Tim 5:20);  \n- **Continue growing in Christ**, trusting that He works all things for good (Rom 8:28).\n\nNo matter the outcome, remember that **God’s love is not conditional on our performance**, but **His grace invites us into a relationship that refines us**.\n\n---\n\n### 6. A Closing Word of Hope  \n\nThe world may say, “Everyone does it,” but the **Bible says, “Be holy, for I am holy”** (1 Pet 1:16).  By choosing to align your love story with God’s design, you are **protecting the intimacy God intended**, **safeguarding your future marriage**, and **witnessing a different kind of love**—one that mirrors the steadfast, covenantal love of Christ for the church.\n\n> “Let us therefore pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.” (Romans 14:19)\n\nMay the Holy Spirit give you wisdom, courage, and the deep peace that comes from walking in obedience to the One who loves you beyond measure.\n\n**In Christ’s love and truth,**  \nPastor [Your Name]  \n[Your Church]  \n\n*“If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.”* (James 1:5)",

          "rationale": "Strengths: The response is pastorally caring, biblically anchored, and cites key passages (Genesis 2:24; Hebrews 13:4; 1 Corinthians 6:18-20; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5; Ephesians 5:31-33; Romans 12:2; 1 John 1:9; James 5:16). It emphasizes sex as a gift within covenantal marriage, highlights cultural pressure vs. biblical standard, and offers practical steps (prayer, accountability, premarital counseling, a timeline toward marriage, and boundaries) in a way that seeks to honor God and foster holiness and grace. The closing exhortation and emphasis on grace and identity in Christ are well aligned with orthodox Christian pastoral care. \n\nAreas of correction needed: The interpretation of Hebrews 13:4 could be clearer. The verse affirms that the marriage bed is undefiled within the marriage covenant; outside of marriage, sexual activity is what defiles. The LLM’s phrasing implied the opposite by saying sexual activity outside the covenant is 'undefiled' (i.e., not pure), which is theologically inaccurate. A more precise reading would emphasize that purity and defilement are defined by whether sexual activity occurs inside or outside the marriage covenant. \n\nOther considerations: The guidance to stay together in the same home with boundaries is a common pastoral approach for some communities, but it remains a debated practice among Christians because sex outside marriage remains the key boundary; some traditions would advocate complete separation until marriage. This is more a matter of pastoral strategy than core doctrinal error, but it could shape outcomes differently depending on one’s theological framework."
