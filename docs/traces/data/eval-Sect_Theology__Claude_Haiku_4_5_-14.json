    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity).

          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM's response aligns well with standard orthodox criteria: it identifies core essentials (Trinity, full deity and humanity of Christ, salvation by grace through faith, authority of Scripture, bodily resurrection) and explains how groups fall outside orthodoxy (denial of core Christology, rejection of Scriptural authority, redefining God, or insisting on exclusive salvation outside Christ). It correctly notes that historic councils crystallized beliefs and that gray areas exist (atonement scope, predestination/free will, eschatology, gifts). It acknowledges the need for authoritative boundaries to be held by the historic Christian tradition, while recognizing humility about salvation. A minor caveat is the framing of apostolic tradition as a shared consensus with Protestants; some Protestant traditions emphasize sola scriptura and would contest equal status of tradition. The answer would be strengthened with explicit scriptural grounding (e.g., citations to Matt 28:19, John 1:1, Col 2:9) for each criterion. Overall, the assessment is doctrinally sound, biblically grounded in principle, and nuanced. "
