        "expected": "The Trinity is the Christian doctrine that God exists as three distinct persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) who are coequal and coeternal, yet remain one God in essence and substance. This is a mystery that transcends human comprehension - not three gods (tritheism) nor one person in three modes (modalism), but one God in three persons who are distinct yet inseparable in their divine nature and work.",
        "output": "Short definition\n- The doctrine of the Trinity says that the one true God is three distinct Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who together share one divine essence. God is one “what” (one divine being) and three “whos” (three distinct, personal centers of consciousness and will).\n\nBiblical basis (select texts)\n- Old Testament hints: the plural \"Let us\" in Genesis 1:26; the divine plurality in Psalm 110:1 and Genesis 3:22; theophanies/“Angel of the Lord” passages that speak as God.\n- New Testament: Jesus’ deity and distinct personhood (John 1:1–3, 14; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:3); Jesus praying to and being sent by the Father (John 17; John 5:30); the Father–Son relational language throughout the Gospels and Paul (e.g., John 3:16; Philippians 2:5–11); the Holy Spirit as a personal divine agent who teaches, guides, and can be lied to (John 14–16; Acts 5:3–4; Romans 8:9–11); explicit Trinitarian formulas (Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14).\n\nClassical formulation and technical terms\n- One essence (Greek: ousia or substantia): there is one divine nature or being — God is numerically one.\n- Three persons (Greek: hypostases or personae): Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three real, distinct personal subsistences or centers of relationality within the one divine life.\n- Homoousios: at the Council of Nicaea (325) the Son was affirmed as “of the same essence” with the Father—fully divine, not a creature.\n- Relations of origin: the Father is unoriginated, the Son is eternally begotten of the Father, the Spirit proceeds (the Church later debated the phrase filioque — “from the Son” — but orthodox Trinitarianism affirms eternal relations without making one person inferior).\n\nHow can “one” be “three”? — coherence without contradiction\n- The doctrine avoids contradiction by distinguishing two questions:\n  1. What is God? (one divine essence)\n  2. Who is God? (three persons)\n- A statement such as “God is one” answers the first; “God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit” answers the second. These statements are not logically inconsistent because they refer to different aspects of divinity (essence vs. personhood).\n- Each person is fully and wholly God (not a part of God). The Son is not one-third of God; the Spirit is not one-third. Each person possesses the single divine essence without division (this is the classical claim of “each person has the whole deity”).\n\nDistinctions within unity\n- The persons are distinguished relationally and by origin, not by essence or power. The Father is not the Son; the Son is not the Spirit; the Spirit is not the Father. Yet they share the same divine attributes (omnipotence, omniscience, eternality, etc.) and act inseparably in creation, providence, and redemption (e.g., Father sends the Son; Son obeys Father and accomplishes redemption; Spirit applies redemption).\n\nWhat the doctrine is not (common heresies)\n- Modalism (Sabellianism): the claim that Father, Son, and Spirit are merely three modes or roles of one person. Orthodox Trinitarianism rejects this because Scripture shows distinct, simultaneous interpersonal relations (e.g., Jesus praying to the Father; the Spirit speaking).\n- Arianism: the denial of the Son’s full deity (claiming the Son is a created being). Orthodoxy affirms the Son is uncreated, eternal, and consubstantial with the Father.\n- Tritheism: the claim that there are three gods. Orthodoxy holds strictly to one divine essence.\n\nAnalogies—and their limits\n- Helpful analogies (with caution): one substance in three relations (mind with memory, intellect, will; or sun with light and heat). These can illustrate aspects of the doctrine but always fail to capture the divine mystery fully and often risk error (modalism or partialism) if pressed too far.\n- The right posture: analogies can point out the possibility of unity with relational distinction but must be used humbly and critically.\n\nHistorical grounding\n- Early church defended Trinitarian doctrine against Arius and others; key formulations found in the Nicene Creed (325, expanded 381) and later in the Athanasian Creed. These creeds articulate one God in three co-equal, co-eternal Persons.\n\nPractical and pastoral significance\n- Worship: Christians worship one God who is Father, Son, and Spirit (Matthew 28:19; John 4:23–24).\n- Salvation: the Father plans, the Son accomplishes (incarnation, atonement, resurrection), and the Spirit applies and sustains salvation in believers (Ephesians 1–2; John 14–16; Romans 8).\n- Prayer and Christian life: prayer is to the Father, in the name of the Son, by the power of the Spirit—our knowledge of God’s love and fellowship is shaped by the triune life revealed in Scripture (2 Corinthians 13:14).\n\nMystery without contradiction\n- The Trinity is presented in Scripture and formulated by the church as both knowable and ultimately mysterious. It is not irrational: it is a coherent doctrine answering biblical revelation about God’s oneness and God’s tri-personal life. But because God is infinite and we are finite, the Trinity remains a divine mystery—we can know truly who God is without exhausting God’s being.\n\nOne-sentence summary\n- The Trinity teaches that the one God is eternally three personal, co-equal, co-eternal Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—who share one divine essence and who act together in creation, redemption, and sanctification.",

        "expected": "The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is one person with two complete and distinct natures: fully God and fully human. These two natures are united without mixture, confusion, separation, or division. Jesus is not partly God and partly human, but wholly God and wholly human simultaneously.",
        "output": "Short answer\nThe hypostatic union is the Christian doctrine that in the one Person (hypostasis) of Jesus Christ there are two complete and distinct natures—divine and human—united without confusion, change, division, or separation. In other words, Jesus is fully God and fully man in one person.\n\nWhat the doctrine means (key points)\n- Person vs. nature: A \"nature\" (Greek physis) is what someone is (divine, human). A \"person\" or \"hypostasis\" is who someone is (the Son, the one subject who acts). The hypostatic union affirms: two natures, one person.\n- Fullness of each nature: The Son assumed a true human nature (body and rational soul) while remaining truly and fully God. Neither nature is diminished, mixed into a third kind, or absorbed by the other.\n- The four negatives (Chalcedon, 451): the natures are united \"without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.\" This guards against Eutychianism/Monophysitism (mixing/losing natures) and Nestorianism (splitting Jesus into two persons).\n- Communication of properties (communicatio idiomatum): Because there is one person, the properties of each nature can be ascribed to the one person. For example, we can say \"God suffered\" only in the sense that the one who is God suffered in his true human nature; the divine nature itself does not suffer.\n\nBiblical grounding (select texts)\n- John 1:1,14 — the Word was God and became flesh.\n- Philippians 2:6–8 — the Son, though in the form of God, took the form of a servant and became human.\n- Colossians 2:9 — \"in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.\"\n- Hebrews 2:14–18; 4:15 — Christ shared in our humanity to save us and was tempted like us.\n- 1 Timothy 2:5 — there is one mediator, Christ Jesus (which presupposes his unique unity as God-man).\nThese and related passages undergird the early church’s formulation that the eternal Son assumed real human nature while remaining God.\n\nHistorical formulation and controversy\n- The phrase and careful distinctions were finalized at the Council of Chalcedon (451). Earlier controversies: Nestorius emphasized distinction between two persons; Eutyches and others blurred natures into one. Chalcedon rejected both extremes and set the standard for classical Christology.\n- Some Eastern and Oriental traditions nuance the language (e.g., miaphysitism used by the Oriental Orthodox to stress one united nature \"of the God‑Man\"); Chalcedonian Christians insist this unity preserves both full divinity and full humanity.\n\nPractical and theological significance\n- A saving mediator: Only one who is truly God can reconcile sinners to God; only one who is truly human can represent and redeem humanity (Hebrews 2:14–18; 1 Tim 2:5).\n- Worship and devotion: Because Jesus is the divine Son, he is to be worshiped and trusted as God (e.g., Thomas’s confession in John 20:28). Because he is true human, we can approach him as Brother and sympathetic High Priest (Hebrews 4:15–16).\n- Limits and tensions explained: Scripture sometimes speaks of the Son’s divine attributes (authority, sovereignty) and sometimes of his human limitations (hunger, fatigue, ignorance of a future day). The hypostatic union explains how both sets of realities belong to the one person—each according to its own nature.\n\nA brief example to illustrate\nWhen the Bible says \"The Son of Man hungers\" (human attribute) and also \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me\" (divine authority), the hypostatic union means these are true of the one Person, Jesus, who possesses both a human nature (able to hunger) and a divine nature (possessing authority), without confusing or dividing those natures.\n\nSummary\nThe hypostatic union is the church’s way of saying that Jesus is one Person who is fully God and fully human. This union preserves the integrity of both natures while securing the biblical truth that the incarnate Son alone is the true mediator and Savior of humankind.",

It is a legal declaration by God where the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers, and their sins are forgiven. This justification is received through faith alone (sola fide), by grace alone (sola gratia), based on Christ's finished work alone (solus Christus).",
        "output": "Short definition\n- Justification by faith is God’s gracious act of declaring a sinner righteous on the basis of Christ’s redeeming work, received through trusting faith rather than by human merit or works.\n\nWhat the Bible teaches (key elements)\n- We are sinners in need (sin’s universality and guilt). Scripture says all have sinned and fall short of God’s glory (Romans 3:23). No one can earn righteousness by keeping the law (Romans 3:20).\n- Christ’s substitutionary atonement is the ground. Jesus lived the life we could not live and died in our place; his obedience and suffering satisfy God’s justice and remove our guilt (Romans 3:24–26; 2 Corinthians 5:21).\n- Justification is forensic (a legal declaration). God declares the guilty righteous—an acquittal and acceptance—because Christ’s merit is reckoned to the believer (Romans 4; Galatians 2:16).\n- Faith is the instrumental means. We receive the righteousness of Christ by faith—trusting Christ and his work—not by our works (Ephesians 2:8–9; Romans 3:22–24; Galatians 2:16).\n- Imputation of righteousness. Scripture teaches that Christ’s righteousness is credited to believers (Romans 4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 3:9). We become “righteous” before God because God treats us as if we had Christ’s perfect obedience.\n- Justification is distinct from, but inseparable in practice from, sanctification. Justification is a declared status (an instantaneous act); sanctification is the ongoing work of being made holy (Romans 5–8). True faith issues in a transformed life; good works are the fruit and evidence of justification, not its ground (James 2:14–26; Titus 3:5–7).\n- Assurance rests on Christ’s work and God’s promise. Because justification depends on Christ’s finished work, believers can have confidence before God (Romans 5:1; Romans 8:1).\n\nHow faith functions\n- Faith is more than intellectual assent: it is trusting reliance on Christ for forgiveness and new life. It receives what Christ accomplished and unites the believer to him (John 3:16; Romans 4:5–8; Galatians 2:20).\n- Faith itself is a gift from God and not a human work that earns righteousness (Ephesians 2:8; Philippians 1:29).\n\nDifferent emphases in Christian traditions (brief)\n- Protestant (especially Reformed): stresses forensic justification and imputation of Christ’s righteousness received by faith alone (sola fide). Justification is forensic and irrevocable for those united to Christ.\n- Roman Catholic: emphasizes both the declared forgiveness and an intrinsic renewal; justification includes the infusion of grace, begun at baptism and grown by cooperation with grace and good works.\n- Eastern Orthodox: emphasizes theosis (participation in God’s life) and transformation; more focus on healing and becoming righteous in practice than on a primarily forensic declaration.\nAll traditions use Scripture but differ on how to describe the relation of declaration, renewal, grace, and works.\n\nPractical implications\n- You become righteous before God not by improving yourself first, but by trusting Christ—repenting of sin and receiving Jesus’ person and work. That trust is counted as righteousness because God imputes Christ’s righteousness to you (Romans 4:5–8; Galatians 2:16).\n- Genuine justification will produce repentance and good works as its fruit; it is not merely an intellectual claim (James 2:17).\n- Justification brings peace with God and the beginning of a new life empowered by the Spirit (Romans 5:1; Titus 3:5–7; Romans 8).\n\nConcise answer to “How does someone become righteous before God?”\n- By trusting in Jesus Christ: God credits Christ’s righteousness to the repentant believer who places faith in Christ’s person and work. This trust is the means by which sinners are declared righteous (justified) before God; thereafter the believer is called to live out that righteousness as the Spirit progressively conforms them to Christ.",

It also fairly notes the differing emphases among Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox traditions and recognizes faith as a gift and the transformative fruit of true faith. \n\nAreas of nuance or potential contention: the claim that justification is an “instantaneous act” is more characteristic of some Protestant frameworks (especially Reformation-era formulations) and can misrepresent Catholic and Eastern Orthodox theologies, which often describe justification as a process of grace that includes growth in holiness. The response does acknowledge inseparability of justification and sanctification in practice, but the framed emphasis on an instantaneous act could be read as narrower than historic Catholic/Orthodox teaching. A more explicit mention of the double imputation ( Christ’s righteousness imputed to believers and believers’ sins imputed to Christ) would strengthen completeness for some traditions. Overall, the answer is accurate, well-grounded in Scripture, and nuanced, with the main caveat being a slightly Protestant-centric characterization of justification’s immediacy."

        "input": "What is the doctrine of original sin?",
        "expected": "Original sin is the doctrine that all humanity inherited a sinful nature from Adam's fall. As a result, all people are born with a inclination toward sin and are spiritually separated from God. This doesn't mean infants are guilty of actual sins, but that human nature is corrupted and inclined toward evil apart from God's grace.",
        "output": "Concise definition\n- The doctrine of original sin teaches that because of Adam’s sin the human condition is fundamentally affected: sinful corruption and its consequences (especially death and estrangement from God) are passed on to all his descendants. This leaves every human morally and spiritually impaired—unable of themselves to attain saving fellowship with God—and in need of God’s saving grace in Christ.\n\nBiblical basis (key texts and their contribution)\n- Genesis 3 — The fall of Adam and Eve introduces sin and death into the human story; God’s curse on the ground, the promise of enmity, and the entry of death are the narrative roots of the doctrine.\n- Romans 5:12–21 — Paul draws a contrast between Adam and Christ: through one man sin and death entered the world; through the one man (Christ) the free gift of righteousness and life is given. Paul’s logic is foundational for the idea that Adam’s act has universal consequences and that Christ is the head and remedy for redeemed humanity.\n- Romans 3:23; 1 Corinthians 15:21–22 — “All have sinned” and “in Adam all die, in Christ all will be made alive” reinforce universality and the corporate/representative character of both Adam’s and Christ’s roles.\n- Psalm 51:5 — David’s words (“in sin did my mother conceive me,” NIV) are often cited to support the notion that human life begins under the effects of sin.\n- Ephesians 2:1–3 — Describes humanity as “dead in trespasses and sins,” under the dominion of sinful desires and spiritual forces, indicating radical moral dependence on God’s intervention.\n\nWhat the doctrine claims (core components)\n- Origin: The corruption originates in Adam’s disobedience (the “first sin”) and its consequences.\n- Universality: All humans share in the consequences—mortality, a proclivity to sin, and separation from God.\n- Transmission: The sinful condition is transmitted to descendants. Theologians distinguish between:\n  - “Original corruption” (inherited depravity or disordered nature),\n  - “Original guilt” or imputed guilt (debated: some traditions hold Adam’s guilt is imputed to his offspring; others speak only of inherited consequences),\n  - and “concupiscence” (the disorder of desires).\n- Radical inability: Humans, apart from divine grace, lack the spiritual ability to turn to God or do saving good.\n- Corporate/representative headship: Adam functions as a covenant head; by his act the human race falls; correspondingly Christ is the covenant head who redeems his people.\n\nMajor theological disagreements and nuances\n- Imputation vs. Inheritance: Western (Augustinian/Reformed) theology typically affirms imputed guilt—Adam’s guilt is rightly counted to his descendants—alongside inherited corruption. Eastern Orthodox theology generally rejects imputed guilt, speaking instead of ancestral sin: we inherit death, mortality, and a propensity to sin, but not the legal guilt of Adam. Many Roman Catholic and Protestant formulations affirm both corruption and the reality of guilt, but nuances vary (e.g., baptism and the remission of original guilt in Catholic sacramental theology).\n- Degree and language of “total depravity”: In Reformed thought “total depravity” means sin affects every dimension of human nature (mind, will, emotions, social life); it does not mean every person is as bad as they could be. Arminians affirm serious impairment but insist on prevenient grace enabling a free human response.\n- Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism: Pelagius denied original sin and affirmed human ability to obey God without special grace. Semi-Pelagianism admitted human inability but claimed the human will can initiate the move toward God, with grace completing it. These views were rejected by Western councils and classical Protestant and Catholic doctrine, which affirm the necessity of grace.\n\nHistorical development (brief)\n- Early church: Fathers such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, and especially Augustine (4th–5th c.) developed the doctrine against Pelagianism. Augustine emphasized the transmission of sin and the need for prevenient/irresistible grace.\n- Medieval and Reformed theology: Augustine’s legacy shaped medieval theology and was taken up and systematized by Reformers (Luther, Calvin), who emphasized human inability and the imputation of Adam’s sin and Christ’s righteousness.\n- Eastern Orthodox: Emphasizes ancestral sin, mortality, and a therapeutic view of salvation (theosis), resisting the forensic idea of inherited guilt.\n- Councils: Various regional councils (e.g., Council of Orange, 529) rejected semi-Pelagianism and affirmed the necessity of grace, while also tempering some Augustinian extremes.\n\nSoteriological and pastoral implications\n- Necessity of grace: Original sin makes divine, effectual grace indispensable for salvation (regeneration, justification, sanctification).\n- Christ as Second Adam: The doctrine highlights Christ’s role as the new representative head whose obedience and life secure righteousness and life for believers (central to Romans 5).\n- Church practices: It undergirds practices and doctrines such as infant baptism (in many traditions) as a sign/means of God’s preventing or dealing with original guilt and incorporating infants into the covenant community.\n- Pastoral nuance: The doctrine is not license for despair; it points to human need and God’s provision in Christ. It requires pastoral sensitivity to emphasize human responsibility without ever suggesting people can save themselves.\n\nContemporary questions and reworkings\n- Evolutionary anthropology and modern biology raise questions about how a historical Adam and a single first sin relate to the scientific account of human origins; theologians offer various models (literal historical head, representative head within a broader human population, theological reading of Adam as archetypal).\n- Social and structural sin: Some contemporary theologians emphasize systemic or structural dimensions of sin passed through culture and institutions alongside (or instead of) inherited guilt.\n\nSummary\n- Original sin is the doctrine that Adam’s fall introduced sin, death, and corrupted human nature into the human condition, so that all his descendants are born into a state of moral and spiritual brokenness and in need of God’s redeeming grace. Scripture (especially Genesis 3 and Romans 5) and Christian theological tradition interpret Christ as the remedy—the true “second Adam” who brings life and righteousness to those united to him.",

        "expected": "Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are both biblical truths held in tension. God is completely sovereign over all things, yet humans are genuine moral agents responsible for their choices. Scripture teaches both that God ordains all things and that humans make real choices for which they are accountable. Different theological traditions emphasize these aspects differently (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), but orthodox Christianity affirms both truths without fully resolving the mystery of how they relate.",
        "output": "Brief answer\nDivine sovereignty and human responsibility are both affirmed throughout Scripture and Christian theology: God is absolutely sovereign—He rules, ordains, and accomplishes His purposes—and humans are morally responsible for their choices and will be judged for them. The Bible affirms both truths without resolving fully how they fit together. The proper theological response is to hold them together in biblical tension: deny neither extreme (fatalistic determinism that makes God the author of sin, nor Pelagian/autonomous freedom that removes the need of divine grace).\n\nKey biblical affirmations\n- God’s sovereignty: passages that stress God’s control and decree include Psalm 115:3; Isaiah 46:9–11; Ephesians 1:11; Romans 8:28–30; Proverbs 16:9; Daniel 4:35.\n- Human responsibility: Scripture repeatedly calls people to choose, repent, believe, obey, and will be judged—e.g., Deuteronomy 30:19; Joshua 24:15; Ezekiel 18; Matthew 23:37; Acts 2:23 (Peter holding the crowd accountable for crucifying Jesus, though it was within God’s plan); Romans 1–3 (people culpable for sin).\n- Both together: texts that tightly pair God’s purposes and human culpability include Genesis 50:20 (Joseph: “you meant evil… God meant it for good”), Acts 2:23, and Philippians 2:12–13 (work out your salvation while God works in you).\n\nThe theological problem\nHow can God sovereignly ordain or foreknow all things and yet humans genuinely make moral choices for which they are responsible? Two tensions commonly raised:\n- If God determines every event, is human freedom an illusion and is God the author of sin?\n- If humans have libertarian self-determining freedom outside God’s control, is God’s sovereignty diminished?\n\nMajor theological approaches (short survey)\n1. Classical/Calvinistic compatibilism\n- Thesis: Divine sovereignty and human responsibility are compatible because human choices are voluntary (the agent acts according to desires and nature) even if God decrees or providentially brings about the circumstances and the will. God’s decree is ultimate; human decisions are real and morally significant.\n- Biblical support cited: Romans 9 (God’s sovereign choice), Ephesians 1, Philippians 2:12–13, Acts 2:23.\n- Strengths: Strong emphasis on God’s glory and ultimate control; explains providence and the efficacy of prayer and mission as means ordained by God.\n- Common critique: Critics say it can make God the author of sin or undermine libertarian freedom.\n\n2. Arminian libertarian freedom (classical Arminianism)\n- Thesis: God is sovereign and foreknows all, but He does not deterministically cause every human decision. Humans possess libertarian freedom—genuinely free choices not fully determined by prior causes. God’s foreknowledge does not cause human decisions. Election is conditioned on foreseen faith (in classical Arminianism).\n- Biblical support cited: calls to repent/choose (Deut 30:19; Josh 24:15), texts about God desiring all to be saved (1 Tim 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9), and passages that suggest genuine human initiative in responding to God.\n- Strengths: Preserves human moral responsibility in a robust libertarian sense.\n- Common critique: Raises questions about how God’s exhaustive foreknowledge and sovereign decrees relate to truly undetermined choices.\n\n3. Molinism (middle knowledge)\n- Thesis: God knows not only what will happen (natural knowledge) and what He will do (free knowledge), but also what any free creature would freely do in any conceivable circumstance (middle knowledge). On that basis God sovereignly ordains a world that actualizes certain free decisions without coercing them.\n- Strengths: Seeks to reconcile divine providence with libertarian freedom and God’s meticulous governance.\n- Critique: Controversial among some Reformed theologians; raises deep metaphysical questions about counterfactuals of freedom.\n\n4. Open Theism\n- Thesis: God knows all that can be known, but the future free choices of creatures are not definite facts and so not exhaustively known. God’s relational engagement and dynamic knowledge are emphasized.\n- Strengths: Emphasizes relationality and Scripture’s portrayals of God reacting to human decisions.\n- Critique: Many see it as undermining classical divine immutability and exhaustive foreknowledge; controversial in evangelical circles.\n\nSafeguards and clarifications\n- God is not the author of sin in the moral sense. Scripture denies God tempts people to sin (James 1:13) and frames sin as human rebellion (Romans 1–3). Yet Scripture also teaches God can and does permit, ordain, and harness even sinful acts to accomplish his purposes (Acts 2:23; Genesis 50:20). The distinction between God’s decretive will (what He ordains to come to pass) and His preceptive or moral will (what He commands) is helpful.\n- Freedom in Scripture often means the capacity to act voluntarily according to one’s desires (compatibilist sense), but many theologians also affirm libertarian freedom for moral responsibility—this is where theological systems diverge.\n- Both God’s sovereignty and human responsibility are taught repeatedly; reducing one to the other does violence to Scripture.\n\nPractical and pastoral implications\n- Assurance: God’s sovereignty gives comfort—nothing ultimately frustrates His purposes (Romans 8:28). Believers can rest in God’s wise governance.\n- Urgency of mission and obedience: Human responsibility grounds evangelism, prayer, repentance, and obedience. We are commanded to act and will bear responsibility (Matthew 28:18–20; Acts 1:8).\n- Humility and trust: The tension should cultivate humility—trust God’s wisdom and work while diligently exercising our responsibility.\n- Prayer and means: Scripture teaches God uses means (preaching, sacraments, prayer) to accomplish His ends; Christians should both pray in dependence and work in responsibility (Philippians 2:12–13).\n\nHow to hold the tension\n- Begin with Scripture: affirm all biblical teachings even if we cannot fully reconcile them philosophically.\n- Reject irresponsible extremes: avoid fatalism (which makes God the author of sin) and avoid views that make human freedom autonomous from God’s sustaining grace.\n- Live accordingly: pray, witness, obey, and trust God’s control.\n\nSummary\nBiblically and theologically, divine sovereignty and human responsibility are complementary truths. God is the sovereign Lord who ordains and accomplishes His will in history; humans are morally responsible agents who must choose, repent, believe, and obey. Various theological models (compatibilism, Arminianism, Molinism, Open Theism) try to explain how these truths fit together; none fully removes the mystery. The faithful posture is to affirm both truths, avoid caricatures, and act in obedience, trust, and humble dependence on God’s wisdom and grace.",

        "output": "Short definition\n- To say humans are made in the image of God (imago Dei) is to say that God stamped human beings with a certain likeness to himself that makes them unique among creatures and grounds their dignity, moral responsibility, vocation, and capacity for relationship with God and with one another (Gen. 1:26–27).\n\nBiblical basis (key texts)\n- Genesis 1:26–27: the foundational statement that God created humanity “in our image, after our likeness.”\n- Psalm 8:3–8: highlights human dignity and rule over creation as part of God’s intent.\n- Genesis 9:6 and James 3:9: appeal to the image of God as a reason to value and not defame human life.\n- Colossians 1:15; Hebrews 1:3; 2 Corinthians 4:4: identify Christ as the true “image” of God.\n- Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18; Ephesians 4:24; Colossians 3:10: speak of believers being conformed to the image of Christ (restoration).\n\nMajor ways theologians understand the imago Dei\nThe Bible does not give a single technical definition, so theologians have emphasized complementary aspects:\n\n1. Substantive (what the image is)\n- This view locates the image in particular capacities or features of humans — reason, moral awareness, self-consciousness, language, will, or a spiritual/freely relating soul. Genesis’s account implies a qualitative likeness (not physical) to God’s spiritual, personal nature.\n\n2. Relational (who humans are)\n- The image is primarily about being persons made for relationship: with God (capable of knowing and worshiping him) and with others (community, marriage, sociality). The plurality in “Let us make man” and the creation of male and female (Gen. 1–2) are often cited here.\n\n3. Functional / vocational (what the image does)\n- The image is expressed in humanity’s role as God’s representatives or stewards over creation (the cultural mandate, Gen. 1:26–28; Psalm 8). Being God’s vice-regents means exercising wise, moral rule that reflects God’s good governance.\n\n4. Structural / holistic\n- Some combine the above: the image is a complex pattern of capacities (spirituality, rationality, morality, relationality, creativity) that together make humans persons who can represent God.\n\nWhat the image is not\n- It is not primarily a physical resemblance (God is spirit, John 4:24).\n- It should not be reduced to a single trait (e.g., intelligence) so that people who lack that trait would be dehumanized.\n- It is not identical to possession of saving faith; the image belongs to all human beings as God’s creatures (Gen. 9:6).\n\nThe effect of the Fall\n- The Fall did not erase the image of God; it distorted, marred, and disordered it. Scripture and classical theology insist the image remains in sinners (hence commands against murder, insults, etc.), but human capacities and relationships are broken (Gen. 3; Romans 1–3). Different traditions nuance this: some say certain aspects of the image are lost; others insist the image as such remains though wounded.\n\nChrist as the perfect image and the aim of restoration\n- Jesus is the perfect Image of God (Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3). Redemption aims to restore the image in believers and ultimately in all creation — becoming conformed to Christ’s image (Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 3:18; Eph. 4:24). In Eastern theology this restoration is often described in terms of “likeness” and theosis (participation in God’s life).\n\nPractical and ethical implications\n- Human dignity and equality: Because every human bears God’s image, all persons have intrinsic worth and equal moral standing (implications for race, sex, disability, age, etc.).\n- Moral accountability: Bearing God’s image includes moral responsibility and the capacity to know and do what is right (a basis for law and conscience).\n- Social ethics and public life: The imago Dei grounds care for the vulnerable, limits on taking human life (Gen. 9:6), and responsibilities for just stewardship of creation.\n- Mission and worship: Our vocation as God’s image-bearers includes worshiping God and reflecting his character in culture (creation care, art, science, justice).\n\nSummary\n- Imago Dei is a rich, multi-dimensional biblical teaching: humans are created to reflect God’s personhood, rule as his representatives, relate to him and one another, and steward creation. Sin has marred that reflection, but in Christ the image is being restored, and that fact supplies the theological foundation for human dignity, moral responsibility, and Christian hope.",

It proclaims that salvation is a free gift of God's grace, not earned by human effort, received through faith in Christ alone.",
        "output": "Short definition\n- The word gospel (Greek euangelion) means “good news.” Biblically the gospel is the good news that God has acted in Jesus Christ to redeem sinners, defeat death and evil, and to inaugurate God’s new creation; this salvation is received by repentance and faith and will be consummated when Christ returns (cf. Mark 1:1; Luke 4:18–21; 1 Cor 15:1–4; Romans 1:16–17).\n\nCore factual claims (what happened)\n- God became flesh in Jesus (the Incarnation) and lived a sinless life (John 1:14; Heb 4:15).\n- Jesus died in our place, bearing sin’s penalty and reconciling sinners to God (the atonement/substitution) (1 Cor 15:3; Romans 3:24–26; 2 Cor 5:21; 1 Peter 2:24).\n- God raised Jesus bodily from the dead, vindicating his work and inaugurating new life (1 Cor 15:4–8; Acts 2:22–36).\n- Jesus ascended and is now exalted, ruling as Lord and sending the Spirit to renew his people and empower mission (Acts 1:9–11; Eph 1:20–23; John 14–16).\n\nBasic theological results (what it means)\n- Forgiveness and justification: sinners are declared righteous by God through Christ, not by works but by faith (Rom 3:21–28; Gal 2:16).\n- New birth and indwelling Spirit: believers are regenerated, adopted as God’s children, and enabled for holy living (Titus 3:4–7; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 4:4–7; Eph 1:13–14).\n- Victory over sin, death, and evil: Christ’s death and resurrection break sin’s power and guarantee believers’ future resurrection (Rom 6; 1 Cor 15; Col 2:15).\n- Kingdom: God’s righteous rule is inaugurated in Christ (already) and will be fully realized at his return (not yet) (Luke 11:20; Matt 13; Rev 21–22).\n\nHow people receive it\n- The gospel is received by repentance and faith: turning from sin and trusting Christ alone for salvation (Acts 2:38; Mark 1:15; Eph 2:8–9). Faith is not mere assent but personal reliance on Christ and his work.\n\nWhy it is distinct and central\n- The gospel is not primarily a moral program or self-improvement plan. It is news about what God has done in Christ for sinners and the new life that results. Paul says the gospel is of “first importance”: Christ died for our sins, was buried, and raised (1 Cor 15:3–4). Christianity is therefore centered on a person and his saving work, not chiefly on rules or ideology (Phil 3:8–9).\n\nPractical and pastoral corollaries\n- The gospel produces assurance of forgiveness, hope of resurrection, gratitude, worship, obedience, and mission (Rom 5–8; Matt 28:18–20).\n- The church proclaims this message, administers the means of grace (Word, sacraments), and bears witness to the kingdom until Christ returns.\n\nBrief note on emphases\n- Different traditions highlight aspects of Christ’s saving work (e.g., penal substitution, Christus Victor, moral exemplar), but historically and biblically the core gospel affirms Christ’s atoning death and victorious resurrection, justification by grace through faith, and the new creation inaugurated in him (Col 1:19–20; 2 Cor 5:17).\n\nOne-sentence summary\n- The gospel is the good news that God, in Christ—through his life, substitutionary death, and bodily resurrection—has removed sin’s guilt and power, brought people into a reconciled relationship with himself by grace through faith, and will perfect his renewed creation when Christ returns (1 Cor 15:1–4; Rom 3:21–26; Rev 21–22).",

        "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
        "output": "Definition and core claim\n- The doctrine of the resurrection of the body teaches that at the last day God will raise the dead so that every human person will be bodily reunited and transformed. Resurrection is not merely the survival of an immaterial soul, nor a resuscitation of the old corpse, but the creation of a renewed, imperishable bodily life in continuity with the person’s pre‑mortem identity and in discontinuity with the corruptible and mortal condition of death.\n\nBiblical foundation\n- Old Testament anticipations: Daniel 12:2 speaks of the sleeping dead awakening to everlasting life or shame; Job 19:25–27 expresses hope to see God after death; Psalm 16:10 (and the use of this psalm in Acts) looks forward to vindication beyond the grave.\n- Central in the New Testament:\n  - Jesus’ resurrection is the model and guarantee: the risen Christ is bodily (not merely a spirit), appears with wounds and eats with his disciples (Luke 24; John 20–21). Paul presents Christ as “the firstfruits” of the coming general resurrection (1 Cor 15:20–23).\n  - Explicit teaching about the future bodily resurrection: John 5:28–29 (all who are in the graves shall hear his voice), Acts 24:15, and Revelation 20:4–6.\n  - Paul’s systematic teaching in 1 Corinthians 15: the gospel depends on Christ’s resurrection (vv. 12–19); the dead will be raised “imperishable” (v. 42) and “in a spiritual body” (v. 44); what is sown perishable is raised imperishable (vv. 35–58).\n  - Romans 8:11 links the Spirit who raised Christ to the future life of believers’ bodies; Philippians 3:20–21 speaks of Christ transforming our lowly bodies to be like his glorious body.\n\nNature of the resurrection body (continuity and discontinuity)\n- Continuity: Personal identity is preserved. The resurrection body is the same person’s body in some real sense (Paul insists on continuity: “that which you sow is not made alive unless it dies” and “we shall all be changed” — 1 Cor 15:36–52).\n- Discontinuity/transformation: The resurrection body differs qualitatively from our present corruptible bodies. Paul contrasts “perishable” vs “imperishable,” “dishonorable” vs “glorious,” “weak” vs “powerful,” “natural body” vs “spiritual body” (1 Cor 15:42–44). It will not be subject to decay, weakness, sickness, or death and will be fitted for the redeemed life of the new creation.\n- Not merely “spirit”: When Scripture calls the resurrection body “spiritual” (pneumatikon), Paul means it is oriented and empowered by the Spirit, not that it is non‑bodily. The New Testament repeatedly affirms a bodily, not disembodied, future.\n\nTiming and order\n- The New Testament teaches a twofold sense of resurrection:\n  - Christ’s resurrection is already—his resurrection inaugurates the new age and is the down payment of believers’ resurrection (1 Cor 15:20–23; Rom 8:11).\n  - The general or final resurrection occurs when Christ returns, at which the dead in Christ will be raised and all will be judged (1 Thess 4:13–18; John 5:28–29; Rev 20). Some texts (e.g., Revelation 20:4–6) speak of a “first resurrection” of the righteous and a later resurrection and judgment of the wicked; how to order all eschatological details has been discussed in diverse traditions.\n\nRelation to the intermediate state\n- The Bible also pictures an intermediate state in which the believer’s soul is with Christ (Phil 1:23; Luke 23:43) or asleep until the resurrection (1 Thess 4:13–14 language). Most historic Christian traditions hold that the soul consciously enjoys fellowship with Christ after death and that full human life is consummated only at the bodily resurrection.\n\nTheological significance\n- Vindication and justice: Resurrection is God’s vindication of the righteous and the final judgment of the wicked (Acts 17:31; John 5:29).\n- Redemption of the whole person and creation: Resurrection shows that salvation is not disembodied spiritual escape but the redemption of body and soul and the renewal of creation (Romans 8:19–23; Revelation 21–22).\n- Assurance and hope: The bodily resurrection of Christ guarantees believers’ future resurrection (1 Cor 15:20–23) and provides comfort in death (1 Thess 4:13–18).\n- Ethical motivation: Because bodies matter and will be redeemed, Christian morality cares for embodied life and justice in this world.\n\nHistorical and confessional note\n- The early church and the creeds confess “the resurrection of the body” (Apostles’ Creed, Nicene Creed). This rejects both Greek‑style dualism that denigrates the body and any view that reduces resurrection to mere immortality of the soul or to reincarnation.\n\nCommon objections and brief responses\n- Objection: How can identity persist if the body is radically transformed? Response: Scripture teaches both continuity and transformation. Personal identity is maintained (appearing to the same disciples, bearing wounds) even as the body is glorified and no longer corruptible (1 Cor 15; Luke 24).\n- Objection: Is the resurrection simply symbolic? Response: The New Testament treats resurrection as a real future event rooted in the historical resurrection of Jesus; Paul bases Christian hope on bodily resurrection (1 Cor 15).\n\nPastoral implications\n- The doctrine brings concrete hope in the face of death, shapes mourning (not despair), grounds bodily care and social justice, and orients Christian worship and mission toward the renewal of all things.\n\nSummary\n- The resurrection of the body proclaims that God will raise the dead, reuniting and transforming body and soul. Grounded in Christ’s own bodily resurrection and taught throughout Scripture, it affirms both the continuity of personal identity and the discontinuity of a glorified, imperishable life—and it lies at the heart of Christian hope for the redemption of persons and creation.",

It correctly emphasizes: the future, bodily nature of the resurrection; continuity of personal identity with a transformed, imperishable body; and the central role of Christ’s resurrection as the guarantee and pattern (firstfruits). It aligns with key New Testament texts (1 Cor 15; Rom 8:11; Phil 3:20–21; John 5:28–29; 1 Thess 4:13–18; Acts 24:15; Rev 20:4–6) and meaningful Old Testament anticipation (Dan 12:2; Job 19:25–27; Ps 16:10 in its NT apostolic use). The discussion of “spiritual body” in 1 Cor 15:44 is handled with a standard nuance: the body is truly bodily and empowered by the Spirit, not non-physical. It acknowledges the tension between continuity and transformation (Paul’s language of perishable/imperishable, natural/spiritual) and preserves both the salvific scope (body, soul, creation) and the ethical implications (care for embodied life). It also notes the intermediate state and the eschatological sequence (inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection, culminated at his return, with a place for a “first resurrection” motif in Revelation 20). Pastoral and confessional notes are included, reflecting historic creedal language. The response is well-grounded in Scripture and consistent with historic orthodoxy. Minor caveats exist in how some texts are interpreted (e.g., the exact nuances of “spiritual body” and the precise ordering of bodily resurrection in Revelation 20), but these do not undermine the overall accuracy or doctrine presented."

              "explanation": "The response presents a broadly orthodox, biblically grounded account of the resurrection of the body, aligning with historic creeds and major biblical passages. It emphasizes continuity of personal identity, yet transformation to an imperishable, glorified body; rejects Gnostic/Docetic denials of material flesh; asserts the bodily resurrection in both the present age (Christ's resurrection) and the future (final resurrection). It also notes the intermediate state and two-stage eschatology without asserting a non-orthodox position. While some interpretive nuances differ among traditions (e.g., exact nature of 'spiritual body' or the order of resurrections), these are not heretical errors. No denial of the Trinity or Christ's divinity is evident; overall, no heresy is detected."
