    "expected": "",
    "output": "Short answer\nChristians read the Old Testament law through the lens of Christ. Jesus “fulfilled” the law (Matt 5:17–20; Rom 10:4), which means the law’s purpose and goal are completed in him. That fulfillment changes how Christians are bound by the different parts of the OT law: ceremonial/ritual laws point to Christ and are fulfilled in him; Israel’s civil laws belonged to the theocratic nation; the moral core (summarized in the Ten Commandments and in Jesus’ commands to love God and neighbor) continues to express God’s character and shape Christian ethics, now received and obeyed in the power of the Spirit rather than as a means of justification (Gal 2:16; Rom 3:28; Rom 8:2–4).\n\nKey biblical texts to weigh\n- Jesus: Matthew 5:17–20 — “I have not come to abolish the Law but to fulfill it.” He deepens moral requirements (e.g., anger = murder in heart).  \n- Paul: Galatians and Romans — law cannot justify; it shows sin and drives us to Christ (Gal 3:21–24; Rom 3:20); law is not the way of salvation (Gal 2:16). Yet Paul upholds moral truths (e.g., love fulfills the law, Rom 13:8–10).  \n- Acts 15 and Acts 10 — the early church distinguished obligations for Jewish and Gentile believers (e.g., Gentiles were not placed under circumcision or full food laws).  \n- Hebrews — presents Christ as the final sacrifice and priest, implying the temple/ritual system has been completed in him (Heb 8–10).  \n- Mark 7; Acts 10 — dietary and purity distinctions are treated as no longer binding for Gentile Christians.\n\nClassical ways Christians have divided the law\n- Ceremonial/ritual laws: sacrifices, temple, festival regulations — typically seen as fulfilled in Christ and no longer binding in their Old covenant form.\n- Civil/judicial laws: laws governing Israel as a nation — normally treated as specific to the old covenant theocracy; they can provide principles for justice but are not applied literally to other polities.\n- Moral law: enduring ethical commands (e.g., Ten Commandments) that reflect God’s character. Many traditions say this remains binding.\n\nHow different traditions put this together\n- Reformed/Protestant: often emphasize the “threefold use” of the law (civil restraint, pedagogical/convicting of sin, and a moral rule for Christian life). The moral law (Ten Commandments) remains normative, but Christians are not justified by law-keeping. The Spirit enables obedience.  \n- Roman Catholic & Eastern Orthodox: stress continuity. Ceremonial laws are fulfilled, but the moral law (and principles of natural law) remain binding; the law finds its fulfillment in Christ and is applied through the life of the Church and sacraments.  \n- Dispensational/evangelical: often draw a strong distinction between Israel’s law and the church, holding moral commands continue but ceremonial/civil are not binding.  \n- Messianic/Hebrew Roots movements: some argue for broader Torah observance (Sabbath, dietary laws, festivals) for followers of Jesus; this is controversial and not the majority position in historic Christianity.\n\nPractical implications for Christians today\n- Don’t be purely legalistic: the New Testament consistently warns against seeking justification by law-keeping (Gal 2–3; Rom 3–4). Salvation is by grace through faith in Christ.  \n- Take the moral demands seriously: love God and neighbor, the Ten Commandments’ ethical content, and Jesus’ high moral standards remain normative and are to be pursued by the power of the Spirit (Rom 8; Gal 5).  \n- Recognize fulfilled, typological, and covenantal changes: sacrificial, priestly, and most purity/food laws are fulfilled in Christ and reinterpreted in the new covenant (Hebrews; Acts 10).  \n- Apply biblical moral principles contextually: Israel’s civil laws can inform Christian reflection about justice, punishment, marriage, and social life, but they don’t map one-to-one onto modern states.  \n- Practice charity in disputed matters: where Christians disagree (Sabbath observance, dietary practices, circumcision’s meaning), follow conscience, Scripture, and pastoral wisdom (Rom 14; 1 Cor 8–10). Unity in the church should be preserved while allowing legitimate diversity in non-essential practices.\n\nA final thought\n“Fulfilled” does not mean “irrelevant.” Through Christ the law’s goals are achieved — sin exposed, God’s holiness revealed, and God’s redemption accomplished. Christians therefore live under grace, guided by the Spirit, seeking to embody the moral heart of the law (love, justice, holiness) rather than trying to rebuild salvation by ritual compliance.",
