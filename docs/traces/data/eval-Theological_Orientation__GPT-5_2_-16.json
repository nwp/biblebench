    "expected": "",
    "output": "The Bible does not use modern terms like *social justice*, *systemic racism*, or *economic inequality*, but it speaks extensively about **justice, partiality, oppression, ethnic hostility, power, wealth, and the treatment of the poor**. Christian traditions differ in emphasis, yet most agree that these themes are not peripheral to faithful discipleship—while also insisting that the gospel cannot be reduced to any political program.\n\n## 1) Social justice: a major biblical theme, not a modern add-on\n\n### Old Testament\nThe Hebrew Scriptures repeatedly portray God as a defender of the vulnerable and a judge of unjust societies.\n\n- **God’s character and requirement:** “Do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God” (Micah 6:8).  \n- **Condemnation of exploitation:** Prophets denounce those who “trample on the poor” and create systems that enrich the powerful (Amos 5:11–24; Isa 10:1–2).  \n- **Justice in courts and commerce:** Israel is commanded to avoid favoritism and dishonest weights (Lev 19:15, 35–36; Deut 16:19–20).  \n- **Economic guardrails:** Sabbath and Jubilee laws (Exod 23:10–11; Lev 25) aim to prevent permanent underclasses and generational dispossession.\n\nThis is not merely private charity; it includes **public righteousness**—how a community organizes life so that the weak are not crushed.\n\n### New Testament\nJesus announces God’s kingdom as “good news to the poor… liberty to the oppressed” (Luke 4:18–19), and he consistently links love of God with love of neighbor in tangible terms (Luke 10:25–37).\n\n- **Judgment scenes and the poor:** In Matthew 25:31–46, care for “the least of these” is treated with sobering seriousness. Interpretations differ on who “the least” are (disciples vs. the vulnerable broadly), but either way it rejects a faith detached from material mercy.\n- **The church’s moral test:** “Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead” (James 2:14–17). James explicitly condemns **favoritism** toward the wealthy (James 2:1–9) and warns rich oppressors (James 5:1–6).\n- **Apostolic practice:** The early church organized relief for the poor (Acts 2:44–45; 4:32–35; 6:1–7) and took up collections across ethnic and geographic lines (2 Cor 8–9; Rom 15:25–27).\n\n## 2) Systemic racism: the Bible condemns partiality and ethnic hostility—and recognizes “powers” beyond individuals\n\nThe Bible does not speak in modern sociological categories, but it does address the spiritual and communal realities that underpin what people today describe as “systemic” injustice.\n\n### Condemnation of partiality and ethnic superiority\n- **No partiality in God:** “God shows no partiality” (Acts 10:34–35).  \n- **Against favoritism in judgment:** “Do not be partial to the poor or defer to the great” (Lev 19:15).  \n- **One new humanity in Christ:** Christ breaks down “the dividing wall of hostility” between Jew and Gentile (Eph 2:14–16).  \n- **Ethnic reconciliation as gospel fruit:** Paul rebukes Peter’s separation from Gentiles not as a minor social faux pas but as conduct “not in step with the truth of the gospel” (Gal 2:11–14).\n\n### More than individual sin: “powers and principalities”\nThe New Testament also speaks of **supra-personal evil**—patterns and structures that deform human life:\n- “We wrestle… against the rulers… authorities… cosmic powers” (Eph 6:12).\n- Sin can become *entrenched* (Rom 1:18–32 portrays societal dynamics, not only private acts).\n\nMany Christians who use the language of “systemic racism” are trying to name the way **historic injustices can become embedded in laws, institutions, and habits**, producing unequal outcomes even without overt personal hatred. Others worry that the term can be used imprecisely or ideologically. Biblically, Christians should be able to affirm both:\n1) **personal culpability and repentance**, and  \n2) the reality of **entrenched, communal injustice** that also requires repentance, repair, and reform.\n\n## 3) Economic inequality: Scripture warns the rich and protects the poor, without condemning all wealth\n\nThe Bible does not teach that all inequality is automatically sinful, but it does teach that wealth is spiritually dangerous and that God hears the cry of the poor.\n\n- **Warnings to the rich:** “How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!” (Mark 10:23–25). “Woe to you who are rich” (Luke 6:24).  \n- **Condemnation of unjust gain:** Scripture repeatedly condemns those who enrich themselves by oppression (Prov 14:31; Amos 8:4–6).  \n- **A command to generosity:** The wealthy are to be “rich in good works… ready to share” (1 Tim 6:17–19).  \n- **A vision of economic fellowship:** Paul frames generosity as a kind of equitable sharing within the church family (2 Cor 8:13–15).\n\nChristians disagree about what economic policies best serve justice (and the Bible doesn’t hand us a modern blueprint), but Scripture is clear that **greed, exploitation, indifference to the poor, and luxury built on injustice are serious sins**.\n\n## 4) Are these “gospel issues” or distractions from evangelism?\n\n### Why many Christians say they *are* gospel issues\n1) **The gospel creates a new people.** Reconciliation with God produces reconciliation across dividing lines (Eph 2:14–22). When the church tolerates ethnic pride, contempt, or segregation, it contradicts what it proclaims.  \n2) **The gospel includes the kingdom ethic.** Jesus’s call is not only to secure forgiveness but to follow him in a way of life shaped by the kingdom (Matt 28:18–20; Luke 9:23).  \n3) **Justice and mercy authenticate witness.** Good works don’t replace the message, but they adorn it (Matt 5:16; Titus 2:10).  \n4) **Scripture ties love of neighbor to genuine faith.** Neglect of the poor and oppressed is treated as spiritually fatal (James 2; 1 John 3:16–18).\n\nFrom this angle, justice is not “another gospel,” but a **necessary fruit and public implication** of the true gospel.\n\n### Why other Christians warn they can become distractions\n1) **Mission drift:** Churches can substitute activism for proclamation, reducing salvation to social improvement and neglecting sin, repentance, and faith in Christ (1 Cor 15:1–4).  \n2) **Ideological capture:** “Justice” language can be filled with assumptions that conflict with Christian anthropology, forgiveness, or truthfulness.  \n3) **Confusing church and state:** The church has a clear mandate (word, sacrament, discipleship, mercy), while political strategies require prudential judgments where Christians may disagree.\n\nFrom this angle, the caution is not that justice is unbiblical, but that **the church must not replace evangelism with political identity or treat contested policy prescriptions as articles of faith**.\n\n### A balanced theological synthesis\nMany Christians—across evangelical, Catholic, Orthodox, and mainline traditions—try to hold together two truths:\n\n- **The gospel is the good news of Christ crucified and risen for sinners** (1 Cor 15:3–4), received by repentance and faith.  \n- **This gospel necessarily produces a community shaped by justice, impartiality, mercy, and generosity** (Eph 2:8–10; James 2).\n\nSo, social justice concerns are best understood as **gospel-shaped discipleship**: not the center of the gospel message in the narrow sense, but not optional “distractions” either.\n\n## 5) Practical implications for churches and believers\nA biblically faithful approach often includes:\n\n- **Preaching both grace and obedience:** forgiveness in Christ *and* the commands to love neighbor and reject partiality.  \n- **Examining the church’s own life:** Are there patterns of exclusion, favoritism, or indifference to the poor? (James 2; Acts 6).  \n- **Mercy ministries with dignity:** sustained care for the vulnerable, not mere image management (Matt 25; 1 John 3).  \n- **Cross-ethnic fellowship and repentance:** pursuing truth-telling, listening, reconciliation, and repair where real wrongs occurred (Gal 2; Eph 2).  \n- **Freedom on policy, unity in principle:** Christians can agree on biblical ends (justice, protection of the weak) while debating best means without anathematizing one another (Rom 14 principles applied carefully).\n\n**Bottom line:** The Bible teaches that God cares deeply about justice, opposes partiality and oppression, and warns against wealth without mercy. These are not a replacement for evangelism; they are part of the integrity and fruit of the gospel—provided the church keeps Christ’s saving work at the center and resists turning the faith into a captive of any ideology.",
