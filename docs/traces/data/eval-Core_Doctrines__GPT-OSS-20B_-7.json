    "expected": "The resurrection of the body is the Christian belief that at Christ's return, the dead will be raised with transformed, imperishable bodies. This will be a physical resurrection, not merely spiritual immortality. Believers will receive glorified bodies like Christ's resurrection body - real and physical yet freed from decay, death, and limitations of our current bodies. This demonstrates that God's redemption extends to the whole person, not just the soul.",
    "output": "## The Resurrection of the Body  \n*(A systematic‑theological, biblically grounded overview)*  \n\n---\n\n### 1.  What the Doctrine Claims  \n\n**The Resurrection of the Body** is the Christian belief that, at the end of time, every human being will be brought back to life in **a physical, glorified body**. This body will not be the same physical body that died; it will be an **“unmixed”** (or “perfected”) body—incorruptible, immortal, and united to the same rational mind that lived in the old body. The resurrection is a **union of body and spirit**; it is not a purely spiritual or purely physical event.\n\nKey points:\n\n1. **Body is Integral** – Human nature is “body + spirit” (or “body + soul”). Death does not abolish the body; it only separates it from the spirit.  \n2. **Body Transforms, Not Replaces** – The resurrected body is a transformed form of the original body, not a completely new material or purely spiritual entity.  \n3. **Glorified and Imperishable** – The resurrected body is free from decay, sin, and the power of death.  \n4. **Individual, Not Collective** – Each person receives a unique resurrected body and will be judged individually.  \n5. **Temporal & Eternal Dimensions** – The resurrection occurs in two stages: the “mortal” resurrection (first Easter) in the church community and the “eternal” resurrection (final judgment) at God’s final consummation.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Scriptural Foundations  \n\n| Old Testament | New Testament | Passages & Short Insight |\n|---------------|---------------|--------------------------|\n| **1 Corps. 15:5‑10** | **Philipp. 3:20‑21** | God will transform our mortal bodies, giving us a “body of glory.” |\n| | **1 Thess. 4:13‑18** | *“When the dead in Christ rise, we who are alive will be changed.”* |\n| | **2 Cor. 5:1‑10** | “We have a tent of this world, but we want a building from God.” |\n| | **Heb. 9:27** | “Death follows the body; only then does judgment come.” |\n| | **Rom. 8:18** | Suffering produces “future glory” that is “new‑created.” |\n| | **1 Cor. 15:20‑32** | The first point of the resurrection, proof, and a demonstration of victory over death. |\n| | **Revel. 20:5; 21:4‑9** | “Mortality is no more; the new heavens and new earth.” |\n| | **Isa. 25:8** | God will wipe the dust from every face; implies cleansing and renewal. |\n\nIn **1 Cor. 15:** the apostle presents the resurrection in detail, contrasting the *old body* (corruptible, perishable) with the *new body* (imperishable, glorious). He emphasizes that **no “dust” remains (15.44)** after restoration, reinforcing the idea that the resurrected body is *new and unblemished*.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Historical Development  \n\n| Period | Key Thinkers | Contribution |\n|--------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Early Church (c. 100‑400 CE)** | Tertullian, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria | Established the bodily resurrection early; refuted *spiritualist* and *mortalist* heresies. |\n| **Medieval (c. 800‑1200 CE)** | Augustine of Hippo | Theological synthesis: death as bodily separation, resurrection as a perfect union, importance for eschatology. |\n| **Reformation (c. 1517‑1700 CE)** | Luther, Calvin, Melanchthon | Affirms the literal resurrection of bodies; emphasises it as proof of divine love & power. |\n| **Modern (c. 1700‑present)** | Karl Barth, Jürgen Moltmann, William Lane Craig | Explores the resurrection in light of biblical theology, existential hope, and apologetics. |\n\nThe doctrine was central to early Christian baptismal theology (i.e., the hope of “resurrection of the just and justifies the righteous”), and it has remained a pivotal point of Christian confession since the *Apostolic Creed* and the *Nicene Creed*.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Theological Nuances  \n\n#### 4.1  “Unmixed” vs. “Re‑mixed”  \n- **Unmixed body**: The resurrected body is a **new creation** that possesses the qualities of the original body but without its perishable nature.  \n- **Re‑mixed body**: Some interpretations hold that the resurrected being is a new synthesis of body and spirit but with a new physical form.  \nThe consensus among most traditions is that the resurrected body is a transformed, glorified continuity rather than a completely new creation.\n\n#### 4.2  Resurrection vs Immaterial Spiritualism  \n- The **spiritualist** position denies bodily resurrection, insisting the resurrection is purely spiritual.  \n- The doctrine of bodily resurrection counters this by scriptural proof (e.g., 1 Cor. 15.41‑44) and the biblical narrative of bodily resurrection of Jesus and the dead.\n\n#### 4.3  Resurrection of the Just & the Unjust  \n- **Resurrection of the just**: Those in Christ will have a new body *for a long time* (cf. **1 Cor. 15.20‑22**).  \n- **Resurrection of the unjust**: The final resurrection will bring forth bodies for judgment (cf. **Revel. 20:12‑14**).  \nThus the doctrine accommodates both an immediate, partial resurrection and a universal final one.\n\n#### 4.4  Body–Soul Integration  \n- **Personhood**: The resurrected individual will continue as the same human being.  \n- **Rational Mind**: The intellect/Spirit is reunited with the resurrected body but not disembodied.  \n- **Ethical Implication**: Our stewardship of the body in life correlates with the eternal nature of the resurrected body.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  How Major Christian Traditions Teach It  \n\n| Tradition | Core View | Key Texts |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Roman Catholic** | Belief in *unmixed bodies* and *communion of bodies* (the Church as a spiritual body). Resurrection is a manifestation of *new creation* (*Mundus Renatus*). | *Catechism of the Catholic Church* para. 1016‑1023; *Lumen gentium* on communion. |\n| **Orthodox** | Resurrection seen as **\"a return to the original life\"**, with bodies “unmixed” (Neoplatonic influences). Resurrection is a cosmic transformation. | *Theologia Greek, 2nd Vol.*; *Synaxis of the Resurrection*. |\n| **Lutheran** | “Glorified body” – the body is *alive* and *immortal*. It is a central part of salvation history. | Luther’s “Commentary on 1 Cor. 15”; *Lutheran Confessions*. |\n| **Reformed / Calvinistic** | Emphasis on *corpus Christi*: body as a symbol of collective faith; resurrection of body as victory over death. | *Canons of Dordt*, *Calvin’s Institutes* (chap. 18 / 19). |\n| **Pentecostal / Charismatic** | Body resurrection understood strongly in terms of *physical transformation* and “glorification”; often emphasizes the bodily aspects of the afterlife (e.g., *Heavenly Church*). | *Acts*, *1 Cor. 15* interpretation in sermons. |\n| **Apostolic/Traditionalist** | Strict literal belief; the resurrected body will be on \"earth\" as a new form. | Early church documents, *Early Athanasian Creed*. |\n\n---\n\n### 6.  The Resurrection in the Life of Faith  \n\n1. **Hope** – The doctrine is the *anchor of hope* (Heb. 6:19), offering a future where suffering and death \"shall be no more.\"  \n2. **Ethics** – Belief in bodily resurrection motivates moral living; the body is entrusted to an eternal destiny.  \n3. **Apologetics** – Resurrected bodies rebut claims that death is the ultimate end and that religion is meaningless.  \n4. **Liturgical Practice** – Baptism, Easter, and funeral rites all point toward the reality that the body will eventually be resurrected.  \n\n---\n\n### 7.  Frequently Asked Questions\n\n| Q | A |\n|---|---|\n| **Can the resurrected body be a different, non‑human form?** | Scripture says the resurrected body will be \"like the one that was raised\" (1 Cor. 15:43). “Like” indicates the same fundamental human nature, not a bizarre creature. |\n| **Will bodily resurrection mean we will live forever literally?** | Yes – the resurrected body is **immortal**. But this immortality does not entail *physical death*; rather, it is a *permanent, glorified life* (1 Cor. 15:53‑54). |\n| **Will the resurrection be on this earth or somewhere else?** | It will occur at God's \"new creation\" – the \"new heavens and new earth\" (Rev. 21:1‑5). The resurrected bodies will exist in that new reality, which will be physically on a renewed earth. |\n| **Does it apply to non‑Christians?** | The doctrine says *all* humans will be resurrected (2 Cor. 5:10). However, *eternal destiny* depends on faith in Christ (cf. Rev. 20:12‑14). |\n| **What about people who are physically missing or whose bodies never returned?** | In the final resurrection, God will restore bodies regardless of circumstance (cf. Rev. 20:5 \"if they were not buried\"). The resurrected bodies will be *new*—a new creation from God’s power. |\n\n---\n\n### 8.  Summary  \n\nThe **doctrine of the resurrection of the body** is a core element of Christian eschatology. It declares that every human being will be resurrected—**not in a purely spiritual sense, but in a glorified, bodily form** that is perfect, incorruptible, and united with its spirit. Scripture affirms this hope in Pauline letters and the early church, and traditions throughout history have held to the bodily resurrection while interpreting its nature differently. It is more than a theological point; it shapes Christian worship, ethics, identity, and the very understanding of life after death.  \n\nBy affirming that the body will be *revived and glorified*, the doctrine ties the everyday physical existence of Christians to a divine future where “Death is swallowed‑up in victory” (1 Cor. 15:54), and hope can remain unshaken in the face of present suffering.  \n\n---",

These issues undermine biblical grounding and doctrinal clarity, even though the overall direction (bodily resurrection, continuity of person, final judgment) aligns with historic Christian teaching. To improve, the answer should: correct the scriptural citations and their interpretations, avoid presenting a universal two-stage resurrection as normative, align historical claims with scholarly dating, and present orthodox positions (Catholic, Orthodox, Reformed, etc.) with precise doctrinal language and recognized sources."
