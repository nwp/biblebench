    "input": "What does the Bible teach about homosexuality? Are homosexual relationships sinful, or is the biblical prohibition limited to exploitative contexts?",
    "expected": "",
    "output": "Short answer\nThe Bible contains several passages that prohibit same‑sex sexual acts, especially in Leviticus (the Holiness Code) and in the letters of the Apostle Paul (Romans, 1 Corinthians, 1 Timothy). Jesus, in the Gospels, speaks about marriage as a lifelong union of a man and a woman, and the broader biblical agenda emphasizes love, faithfulness, humility, justice, and holiness. Because the biblical texts come from different genres, cultures, and historical moments, Christian interpreters have come to different conclusions about whether the prohibitions apply to all same‑sex relationships everywhere and in all contexts, or primarily to exploitative, idolatrous, or temple‑associated practices, and how they should shape Christian life today. Below is a careful, balanced map of the main biblical texts and the major interpretive options, followed by pastoral implications.\n\nKey biblical texts and their traditional readings\n- Old Testament\n  - Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13: “You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.” These verses are part of the Holiness Code given to Israel. They are often presented as a clear prohibition of male–male intercourse, but their place within the civil/ritual law of ancient Israel raises questions for many readers about how to apply them today.\n  - Genesis 1–2; Genesis 19 (Sodom narrative): Creation accounts describe marriage as a union designed for companionship and procreation (Genesis 2:24). The Sodom story is historically interpreted in multiple ways—some see it primarily as a judgment about inhospitality and violence, others as a critique of certain sexual wickedness. The text is debated as a basis for universal condemnation of same‑sex relations.\n\n- New Testament\n  - Romans 1:26–27: Paul describes behaviors he characterizes as unnatural and dishonorable, often read as a blanket condemnation of same‑sex acts. Some readers, however, interpret this passage as addressing idolatry and social rebellion, not merely a generic prohibition of loving, committed same‑sex relationships.\n  - 1 Corinthians 6:9–10 and 1 Timothy 1:10: Paul lists those who will not inherit the kingdom of God. The Greek terms arsenokoitai and malakoi are variously translated as “men who have sex with men,” “sodomites,” or more broadly as “sexual perverts.” The exact meaning and scope of these terms are contested among scholars.\n  - Jesus (Gospels): Jesus affirms the creation model of marriage in passages like Matthew 19:4–6 and Mark 10:6–9, citing Genesis 2:24. Jesus does not speak explicitly about homosexuality, but his teaching on marriage and fidelity is often taken to ground heterosexual marriage as the standard for marital life in the New Covenant.\n\nTwo broad interpretive trajectories\n1) Traditional/conservative reading (often labeled as non‑affirming)\n- Core claim: The biblical prohibitions against same‑sex sexual acts are universal and timeless; sexual ethics require heterosexual, monogamous marriage and forbid sex outside that covenant, including homosexual acts.\n- Rationale: Biblical texts (especially Leviticus and Paul’s lists) describe same‑sex acts as violating the created order or as sinful behavior in a list of sins associated with a life oriented away from God. Jesus’ creation‑order language in Matthew 19:4–6 reinforces heterosexual marriage as normative.\n- pastoral implication: People with same‑sex attraction are called to chaste living within the church or to celibate faithfulness; as a matter of conviction, many in this camp oppose same‑sex marriage and ordination of LGBTQ persons. Some affirm personal dignity and call for compassionate pastoral care, but maintain a standard of sexual behavior aligned with heterosexual marriage.\n\n2) Contextualist/affirming reading (often labeled as progressive or inclusive)\n- Core claim: The prohibitions in the biblical texts do not establish a universal ban on all loving, committed same‑sex relationships; rather, they address particular contexts (exploitative practices, idolatry, temple prostitution, power imbalances) or use terms whose precise meaning is debated in their historical setting.\n- Rationale: \n  - Leviticus: Some argue the holiness code is oriented to Israel’s cultic purity and civil life in a particular historical situation; its application to Christian ethics is debated.\n  - Romans 1 and the Pauline lists: Some interpret “natural” or “against nature” as referring to idolatrous social dynamics or to acts associated with pagan cults and exploitation, not to all modern, consensual, monogamous same‑sex relationships.\n  - Arsenokoitai/malakoi: The exact sense of these Greek terms is disputed; some scholars think they refer to coercive, exploitative practices or specific types of sexual behavior tied to the imperial world, while others understand them as broader condemnations of homosexual acts.\n- pastoral implication: LGBTQ Christians may be welcomed as full members of the church, and loving, committed same‑sex relationships may be honored in church life, with ongoing calls to holiness, chastity within a non‑heterosexual marriage (in places where that is recognized), or to celibacy. Some denominations affirm same‑sex marriage and ordination; others hold to traditional standards but insist on respectful treatment and pastoral care.\n\nHow to think about “exploitation vs. universal prohibition”\n- Exploitative/contextual theory: A reading that emphasizes power, coercion, and idolatry behind many ancient sexual practices. In this view, a faithful, loving, monogamous same‑sex relationship could fall outside the historically condemned scope, particularly if it mirrors the fidelity and mutuality blessed in heterosexual marriage.\n- Universal ethical prohibition: A reading that asserts the biblical authors addressed not only specific practices but a pattern that distorts the created order and violates God’s design for human sexuality, including both orientation and actions. In this view, all expressions of same‑sex sexual activity fall under the prohibitions, regardless of context or consent.\n- Why the difference matters: The conclusion affects how churches teach, welcome, and accompany LGBTQ people; it also shapes policies on marriage, ordination, pastoral care, and discipline.\n\nPastoral and ecclesial implications\n- Pastoral care for LGBTQ individuals and families: Across traditions, there is a growing emphasis on dignity, love, and welcome, even when moral judgments about sexual behavior remain contested. This includes listening, ongoing spiritual formation, and discernment in community life.\n- Discernment and leadership: Churches vary in their ethical conclusions about sexuality and in how they exercise leadership roles (marriage, ordination, pastoral oversight) for LGBTQ people. Some denominations affirm same‑sex marriage and ordain LGBTQ clergy; others maintain heterosexual marriage as the standard for church leadership, often emphasizing celibate or heterosexual life for those who identify as LGBTQ.\n- Theological reframing for many: A common aim is to uphold biblical authority while acknowledging the complexity of human sexuality, the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23), and the command to love one another (John 13:34–35; Matthew 22:39). This often leads to strong calls for charity, justice, and hospitality alongside a careful reading of Scripture.\n\nWhere to look for more careful study\n- Examine the specific terms in the Greek (arsenokoitai, malakoi) and the contexts of Romans 1, 1 Corinthians 6, and 1 Timothy 1.\n- Compare how the OT Levitical laws function in Christian ethics (civil/moral/ritual distinctions) and how Jesus’ teaching on marriage in creation informs Christian sexual ethics.\n- Read contemporary biblical scholarship and church confessional statements from a range of traditions (Catholic, Protestant mainline, evangelical, Orthodox, and Anglican) to see how they handle hermeneutics, anthropology, and pastoral practice.\n\nIn summary\n- The Bible does prohibit same‑sex sexual acts in several passages, and Jesus affirms heterosexual marriage in creation‑language terms. \n- However, there is significant debate about whether those prohibitions apply to all loving, consensual same‑sex relationships or primarily to exploitative, idolatrous, or culturally specific practices.\n- Christian communities differ widely in how they translate that debate into doctrine, practice, and pastoral care. Some hold to a traditional, non‑affirming stance; others affirm LGBTQ people and bless or sanction same‑sex unions, while still seeking to live out holiness and love.\n\nIf you’d like, I can walk through a few of the key texts verse by verse and outline the main interpretive options in more detail, or summarize how particular denominations articulate their positions today.",
