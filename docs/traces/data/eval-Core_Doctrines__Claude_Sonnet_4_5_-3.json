            "No explicit caveat that original sin is not identical to personal sins; the expected answer notes that infants are not guilty of actual sins; while the LLM mentions guilt, it doesn’t clearly distinguish personal sin from the inherited condition."

          "rationale": "The answer faithfully outlines the core elements of original sin: its biblical basis (Genesis, Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, Psalms), universal transmission, effects (guilt/condemnation, corruption, spiritual death, total depravity), and the need for grace with the Christological link to the second Adam. It aligns with historic orthodoxy in many traditions and captures important distinctions and nuances (need for divine grace, Romans 5:15–19). However, it presents guilt as an inherited consequence in a way that can blur differences among traditions (e.g., Catholic teaching on original sin’s relation to personal guilt and Mary’s Immaculate Conception) and it does not explicitly distinguish original sin from personal sins in infancy, which is a common point of clarification in doctrinal discussions. These are minor gaps but worth noting for precise doctrinal communication."

          "explanation": "The response presents an orthodox summary of Original Sin as understood in Western Christian theology: humanity inherits a sinful condition and guilt due to Adam, transmission through natural generation, and effects including guilt, corruption, spiritual death, and total depravity, with salvation occurring only by divine grace through Christ (the second Adam). It cites key passages (Rom 5:12-19; 1 Cor 15:22; Eph 2:1-3; Ps 51:5; Ps 58:3) and rightly notes the central role of grace and Christ’s atonement. Specific issues to note for ecumenical precision: \n- Eastern Orthodox nuance distinguishes ancestral corruption from inherited guilt; the language of “guilt” is more typical of Western (Catholic/Protestant) theology. Some readers may prefer wording that emphasizes corruption and mortality rather than juridical guilt across all people. \n- The clause “All humans (except Christ) inherit this sinful condition” is generally accurate, but could be clarified as: Jesus did not inherit original sin due to the Virgin Birth; He is the sinless Second Adam. \n- The term “Total depravity” is a Reformed/Calvinist technical label; other traditions (e.g., Arminian, Catholic, Orthodox) affirm human depravity and need for grace but use different vocabulary and emphasis on human cooperation with grace. \n- The use of Psalm 51:5 and Psalm 58:3 should be understood in their original genres and translations, noting potential nuances in modern translations. \nOverall, no explicit heretical teachings are present; the main considerations are ecumenical-normative clarifications and nuanced terminology rather than doctrinal errors."
