        "output": "# Perspectives on Hell and Unbelievers\n\nThis question touches on one of the most debated topics in Christian theology, with sincere believers holding different views based on their interpretation of Scripture. Here's an overview of the major positions:\n\n## The Traditional View: Eternal Conscious Torment\n\nHistorically, the majority view in Christianity has been that those who die without faith in Christ will experience conscious, eternal punishment in hell. Proponents point to passages describing ongoing conscious existence after death—parables about Lazarus and the rich man, references to \"weeping and gnashing of teeth,\" and Revelation's imagery of unending torment. Advocates argue this reflects both God's justice and the seriousness of rejecting God.\n\n## Conditional Immortality (Annihilationism)\n\nAn increasingly held view, especially among evangelical Christians, is that the unsaved will not experience eternal conscious torment but will instead be destroyed or cease to exist. Supporters emphasize that the Bible often contrasts \"eternal life\" with \"death\" or \"destruction\" rather than eternal life in reverse. They note passages suggesting the wicked are destroyed, not tormented forever, and argue this better reflects God's justice—a finite punishment for finite sin.\n\n## Universalism\n\nSome Christians hold that God's love will ultimately bring all souls to salvation, though this has been a minority view throughout church history. Advocates find hope in passages about God's redemptive purposes and Christ's lordship over all.\n\n## Wrestling With This Question\n\nThis topic raises profound questions about God's nature, justice, and love. Many Christians find these passages difficult, and theologians continue to study and debate them. Different traditions emphasize different texts, and sincere believers interpret the same passages differently.\n\nWould you like me to explore any of these perspectives in more depth?",
