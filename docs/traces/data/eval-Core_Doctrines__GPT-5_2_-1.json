    "expected": "The hypostatic union is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is one person with two complete and distinct natures: fully God and fully human. These two natures are united without mixture, confusion, separation, or division. Jesus is not partly God and partly human, but wholly God and wholly human simultaneously.",
    "output": "The **hypostatic union** is the Christian doctrine that **Jesus Christ is one divine Person (one “hypostasis”) who exists in two complete natures—truly God and truly man—united without mixture or division**.\n\n### 1) What “hypostatic union” means\n- **“Hypostasis”** (Greek) refers to a *person* or *personal subsistence*.\n- The doctrine teaches that the eternal Son of God (the second Person of the Trinity) **assumed** a real human nature in the incarnation.\n- Therefore, in Christ there are:\n  - **Two natures**: **divine** and **human**\n  - **One Person**: the eternal Son\n\nJesus is not “half God and half man,” nor two persons sharing a body. He is **one Person** who is **fully God** and **fully man**.\n\n### 2) The classic doctrinal boundaries (Chalcedonian language)\nThe Council of Chalcedon (AD 451) summarized what Scripture requires by saying Christ is one Person **“in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.”** These guardrails reject common distortions:\n- Not **confusion/change**: the divine nature doesn’t turn into human, and the human doesn’t become divine.\n- Not **division/separation**: Christ is not two persons (as if “the man Jesus” and “the Son” are separate subjects).\n\n### 3) Biblical grounding\nScripture teaches both Christ’s full deity and full humanity, and it presents them as belonging to the same “I/He” (one personal subject).\n\n**A. Jesus is truly God**\n- **John 1:1**: “the Word was God.”\n- **John 20:28**: Thomas calls Jesus, “My Lord and my God!”\n- **Colossians 2:9**: “In him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.”\n- **Hebrews 1:3**: the Son is “the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature.”\n\n**B. Jesus is truly man**\n- **John 1:14**: “the Word became flesh.”\n- **Luke 2:52**: Jesus grew in wisdom and stature.\n- **Hebrews 2:14**: he shared “flesh and blood.”\n- **1 Timothy 2:5**: “the man Christ Jesus.”\n- **Hebrews 4:15**: tempted like us, yet without sin.\n\n**C. The unity of one Person**\nThe same Person is spoken of with attributes from either nature:\n- **Acts 20:28** speaks of “the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood” (God, yet blood—pointing to the unity of the one Person who is God and who truly has a human nature capable of suffering).\n- **John 8:58**: Jesus claims divine “I AM,” yet he speaks as the historical man standing before them.\n\n### 4) Why it matters (theological significance)\nThe hypostatic union is central to salvation because only such a Christ can be the mediator Scripture describes:\n- To **represent us** and obey, suffer, and die in our place, he must be **truly human** (Heb. 2:17).\n- To **save** with divine power and give infinite worth to his saving work, he must be **truly God** (Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:19–20).\n- Thus he is the one mediator: **God and man in one Person** (1 Tim. 2:5).\n\n### 5) A careful summary\nThe hypostatic union teaches: **The eternal Son of God did not cease to be what he was (God), but he became what he was not (man), so that the one Person, Jesus Christ, is fully God and fully man forever.**",

          "rationale": "The response accurately presents the orthodox doctrine of the hypostatic union: Jesus Christ is one person (the eternal Son) who exists in two complete natures (divine and human) united without mixture, change, division, or separation. It aligns with Chalcedon’s language and intent, and it provides robust biblical support for both natures (e.g., John 1:1; John 1:14; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1; Hebrews 4:15; 1 Timothy 2:5). It also emphasizes the unity of the Person, addressing typical misunderstandings (not two persons; not a mere mixture). Its theological significance is rightly tied to mediation and salvation (Hebrews 2:17; 1 Timothy 2:5; Colossians 1:19–20). A couple of minor nuanced points could be expanded (e.g., explicit mention of the communicatio idiomatum and a more explicit note on the incarnation’s ongoing identity post-incarnation), but there is no doctrinal error present. Overall, the answer is true, historically orthodox, biblically grounded, and nuanced enough for a solid theological understanding."

          "explanation": "The evaluated response faithfully articulates the orthodox doctrine of the hypostatic union as defined by Chalcedon: one Person (the eternal Son) in two complete natures (divine and human) united without mixture, change, division, or separation. It cites Scripture supporting both Christ’s full deity and full humanity and underscores the unity of the two natures in one Person, which aligns with historic Christian orthodoxy. It also correctly rejects common Christological errors (Arianism, Modalism, Docetism, Nestorianism, Pelagianism, etc.) and notes the salvific significance of the union. There are no unorthodox teachings detected. A possible minor caveat is the interpretive nuance of language like “with his own blood” in Acts 20:28, but this does not constitute heresy."
