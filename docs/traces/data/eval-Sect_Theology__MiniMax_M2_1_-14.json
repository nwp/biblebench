    "expected": "Orthodox Christianity is defined by historic ecumenical creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Chalcedonian) that establish essential doctrines: (1) The Trinity - one God in three co-equal, co-eternal persons; (2) The full deity and humanity of Christ - not created, not merely adopted, truly God and truly human; (3) Salvation by grace through faith in Christ's atoning work, not by human merit; (4) The unique authority of Scripture; (5) Christ's physical resurrection; (6) His bodily return. Groups fall outside orthodoxy when they deny these essentials, regardless of using Christian terminology. Using the Bible doesn't make a group orthodox if they radically reinterpret it (like denying Jesus' deity). The line is drawn where essential doctrines that define Christian faith are rejected or fundamentally altered.",
    "output": "# Defining the Boundaries of Orthodox Christianity\n\nThe question of what constitutes orthodox Christianity has occupied theologians, councils, and believers since the earliest centuries of the faith. While no single test guarantees consensus across all traditions, Christianity has historically relied upon doctrinal standards, historical continuity, and theological coherence to assess claims to orthodoxy. Understanding these criteria requires examining both the formal boundaries that have emerged through church history and the substantive teachings that define Christian identity.\n\n## The Foundation: Scripture, Creeds, and Historical Continuity\n\nOrthodox Christianity has traditionally been defined not merely by a profession of faith in Jesus, but by a specific understanding of who Jesus is and what he accomplished. The earliest Christian communities quickly discovered that merely using Christian vocabulary did not prevent serious doctrinal errors. The apostle John's letters, for instance, explicitly address the problem of those who \"went out from us\" despite having appeared Christian—John explains that their departure revealed they were \"not of us\" (1 John 2:19). This suggests that authentic Christian identity involves more than superficial affiliation.\n\nThe ecumenical councils of the fourth and fifth centuries established foundational doctrinal standards that continue to shape orthodoxy across most Christian traditions. The Nicene Creed (325 CE) and its later revision at Constantinople (381 CE), followed by the Chalcedonian Definition (451 CE), created explicit theological boundaries. These councils addressed what they considered heresies—systematic deviations from the apostolic faith—and formulated precise language to exclude teachings deemed incompatible with Scripture's witness to Christ. Groups like the Arians, Nestorians, and Monophysites were defined as outside orthodoxy precisely because their teachings about Christ's nature undermined what the councils deemed essential to the gospel.\n\n## Core Doctrinal Boundaries\n\nSeveral theological criteria have historically determined whether a group falls within or outside Christian orthodoxy:\n\n**Trinitarian Doctrine**: Christianity has consistently maintained that there is one God in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—and that each person is fully divine. Groups that deny the full divinity of Christ (as ancient Arianism did) or that confuse the persons of the Trinity (as Modalism does) have been excluded from orthodox fellowship. This doctrine stands at the center because it defines the identity of the God who redeems.\n\n**Christological Integrity**: Orthodox Christianity affirms that Jesus Christ is fully divine and fully human, two natures united in one person without confusion, change, division, or separation. Teachings that either dissolve Christ's humanity into his divinity or divide him into two separate persons have been deemed heretical. This boundary exists because the church has taught that salvation requires a Redeemer who can truly represent both God and humanity.\n\n**Soteriological Coherence**: What Christ accomplished through his life, death, and resurrection matters enormously. Orthodox teaching has held that Christ's death was a ransom paid for human sin, satisfying divine justice while revealing divine love. Variations that either deny sin's seriousness, reduce salvation to mere moral example, or undermine the substitutionary nature of Christ's sacrifice have been contested across traditions.\n\n**Ecclesiological Continuity**: Most definitions of orthodoxy emphasize connection to the historical church—the community that has preserved and transmitted the apostolic faith through succession of teaching and sacraments. Groups that cannot demonstrate continuity with the church that produced the creeds have often been viewed with suspicion, regardless of their verbal alignment with Christian terminology.\n\n## The Complexity of Application\n\nThese boundaries, while widely accepted in principle, generate significant disagreement in application. The historic Protestant Reformation, for instance, rejected certain Catholic practices and doctrines while firmly maintaining trinitarian and christological orthodoxy. Reformation churches considered themselves reformations of orthodox Christianity rather than departures from it, though the Roman Catholic Church initially regarded them as schismatic. Contemporary Christianity includes trinitarian believers who hold divergent views on baptism, ecclesiology, eschatology, and spiritual gifts—yet who maintain fellowship across these differences.\n\nThis raises an important nuance: Christianity has historically distinguished between fundamental doctrines that determine orthodoxy and secondary matters that permit diversity within the broader Christian community. The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978) attempted to articulate this distinction, identifying certain teachings as essential to Christian orthodoxy while allowing latitude on other issues. Nevertheless, determining which issues fall into which category remains contested.\n\n## When Christian Language Becomes Insufficient\n\nGroups can use Christian vocabulary while teaching doctrines that, upon examination, contradict the faith that creeds and councils preserved. Consider several patterns:\n\nSome groups reframe core doctrines in ways that preserve the language but empty it of orthodox content. If a community affirms that Jesus was \"divine\" but defines divinity in ways that deny Jesus's eternal, uncreated status as co-eternal with the Father, they have retained the word while abandoning the concept. Orthodox theologians would argue that such groups, despite Christian self-identification, have effectively constructed a different religion.\n\nOther groups emphasize teachings that Scripture and the historic church explicitly rejected. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for instance, employs extensive Christian terminology but teaches a polytheistic cosmology, a finite God who was once a man, and a soteriology fundamentally different from historic Christianity. Most mainstream Christian traditions consider Mormonism outside orthodox Christianity despite its sincere claims to follow Jesus.\n\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses similarly use Christian language while denying Christ's eternal existence and full divinity—teachings that classical Christianity considers essential. Their theological reconstruction of Christianity, while earnest, diverges from the faith articulated in the creeds.\n\n## The Limits of Voluntary Association\n\nOne might object that defining orthodoxy imposes artificial boundaries on what should be a matter of personal faith. This objection carries weight in certain respects—church history demonstrates that orthodox communities have sometimes proven spiritually barren while groups on the margins have displayed authentic faith. Nevertheless, Christian orthodoxy has never been merely about individual preference. It has claimed to identify what the apostolic Scriptures actually teach and what the historic church actually believed.\n\nThe line-drawing function serves purposes beyond mere exclusion. Creeds and confessions provide positive articulation of what Christians believe, preserve coherent theology across generations, enable meaningful fellowship among those who share fundamental convictions, and guard against subtle corruptions that erode the gospel over time. The early church drew boundaries not from tribal loyalty but from pastoral concern—doctrinal errors were believed to lead souls away from salvation.\n\n## Conclusion: Substance Over Self-Identification\n\nThe answer to where we draw the line in defining orthodox Christianity ultimately rests on substance rather than self-identification. A group falls outside orthodox Christianity when its teachings, fairly interpreted, contradict the core doctrines that the universal church has identified as essential to the faith once for all delivered to the saints. These core doctrines center on the triune God's identity, Christ's person and work, human sin and divine redemption, and the nature of salvation.\n\nThis does not mean that all non-orthodox groups are equivalent in their deviation or equally distant from Christian faith. Some communities drift only slightly from orthodoxy on peripheral matters while maintaining robust agreement on fundamentals. Others construct theologically distinct systems that happen to employ Christian vocabulary. Discerning between these requires patient theological analysis rather than simple categorization.\n\nThe historic boundaries remain contested precisely because they matter. They represent not arbitrary rules but carefully considered determinations about what the gospel actually is. Those who would cross or redraw these lines bear the burden of demonstrating that their teaching aligns with Scripture and the apostolic faith—not merely that they invoke Christian language while claiming the name of Jesus.",

            "The evaluation of Miaphysite (non-Chalcedonian) groups as definitively 'outside orthodoxy' reflects Chalcedonian/historicism and may overstate a universal boundary; many within those traditions consider themselves orthodox and view the Chalcedonian formula as one historical articulation among others.",
            "The polemical examples of Mormonism (polytheistic cosmology) and Jehovah’s Witnesses (denial of Christ’s full divinity) are common orthodox critiques, but labeling them as outside orthodoxy involves specific confessional judgments not universally shared across all Christian traditions. Some nuance is missing about their self-understanding and how different traditions assess their claims.",
            "The piece sometimes blends terms (e.g., ‘the unique authority of Scripture’, ‘ecclesiological continuity’, ‘sacraments’) in ways that presuppose a particular strand of orthodoxy (often Protestant-Catholic spectrum) rather than the fuller Catholic/Orthodox sense that tradition, magisterial authority, and apostolic succession/patristic consensus may play distinct roles in defining orthodoxy across traditions."
          ],
          "rationale": "The LLM response aligns well with classical markers of orthodox Christianity (creeds, Christology, Trinity, atonement, biblical authority) and emphasizes the distinction between genuine Christian faith and mere Christian-sounding language. It correctly cites creeds and councils as boundaries and acknowledges the fundamental-to-derivative distinction (essentials vs. non-essentials). However, it leans into a somewhat Protestant-centric model of orthodoxy (creeds + ecclesial continuity) and applies labels like ‘outside orthodoxy’ to groups (Miaphysite, Mormonism, Jehovah’s Witnesses) in a way that can be contested within other traditions. It also glosses some complexities (e.g., multiple legitimate expressions of tradition, varying doctrines of Scripture and tradition, and varying atonement theories) that affect precise line-drawing in real-world ecumenical discourse. Overall, the explanation is solid and nuanced enough for a general understanding, but it should acknowledge greater cross-traditional plurality in defining orthodoxy and be careful with certain evaluative labels.)"
